"Jan 10, 2025","The Avengers is the most enjoyable time I've spent with the MCU so far.

It operates with established characters, but they still have character arcs and those are surprisingly very satisfying. Obviously I kind of knew what's going to happen, but that didn't take away a bit from the enjoyment. There were a few moments where I was shocked or didn't know how the story would move forward. The dialogues sometimes feel a little out of place, but are mostly good.

The visual effects have never been this good in the MCU so far, I loved that. I also love the huge cast, although I was sad to see one of my favourite actors, Stellan Skarsgård turned into a villain, alongside Jeremy Renner. The cinematography is great, but the movie is a little too long, so I'm not the biggest fan of the editing. The acting performances are good for a superhero movie.

The Avengers is an amazing culmination to the first phase of the MCU.",9
"Sep 9, 2024","The culmination of Marvel's four-year, five-picture initial phase is, puzzlingly, both as good as I'd hoped and mildly disappointing. The Avengers excels at playing up the story's larger-than-life aspects, from the heroes' testy initial relationships to the looming magnitude of the threat they're called together to face. Such moments are dispersed liberally, perhaps once every five minutes, and they're an effective method of keeping the audience on the hook for the duration.

What's missing, at least from where I sit, is a measure of substance or depth behind those fireworks. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent once again, in his nuanced interpretation of the paradoxical Tony Stark, and Mark Ruffalo might just be the best Hulk ever to grace the silver screen, but by comparison the rest of the cast feels quite thin, shallow and (for lack of a better word) cartoonish. Captain America, for example, wears a completely different personality than he did in his solo picture, and never quite fits as the commanding field general he's meant to be. The most intriguing aspect of his character, an emotional detachment from modern culture, is barely even mentioned. He, and the rest of the team, feels like a suit of armor with a few good one-liners, not a living, breathing human being. That trap was mostly evaded in the stars' preceding solo shots, so it's a shame to see it tripped here, especially given the amount of time and effort that was expended to define each set of personal motivations.

Those nitpicks certainly aren't enough to stop me from enjoying the closest thing we'll ever get to an all-splash-page crossover mega-event on the big screen, but they're also irritating enough to keep tickling the back of my mind while the next set of fuses are lit. It's a herculean effort with some truly great rewards, but not the picture-perfect ensemble masterpiece some might ask you believe.",8
"Jul 27, 2024",A master-class in ensemble filmmaking.  So many moving parts and plot lines and character arcs are juggled with skill and purpose.  The stakes feel real and the melodrama is palpable.,9
"Jan 10, 2024","This was one of the superhero movies of all time. I didn't feel particularly one way or the other about the 2 hours and 22 minutes I spent watching this movie, but Tom Hiddleston's performance as Loki did boost my rating. He was completely believable as the villain and filled me with unease whenever he was on screen. It was glorious to watch.",7
"Dec 8, 2023","This just downright ****. You had to watch Iron Man 1 & 2 which are really good, however you also had to watch the mediocre Captain America along with the bad Thor movie just to understand everything here. This movie is a pathetic and god awful payoff for watching the previous films. The villain also **** and could've just been kicked to the curb by Thor without the other Avengers, Loki isn't an Avengers level threat but they still threw him in here cause they didn't anybody else.",2
"Aug 25, 2023",One of the MCU's finesta and it has a AMAZING score and don't forget what the movies lead to.,8
"Aug 22, 2023","The Avengers movie is definitely a revolution in the cinema and comic book industry. It's unbelievable that you took the time... to wait four years... to show and explain the characters you want one by one, and now... them. Put together in a movie!
The director has managed to collect all the characters in the best way... give them goals... show that they are not a group and that they get hurt! And in the end, they will unite. Really, the sale of 1 billion is worth drinking because it is right.
The only problem I could find is that the weakest character among all the characters is Hawkeye, who is less discussed and I did not understand his purpose in the wonderful battle at the end of the movie.
But other than this, the other excellent things show themselves.",9
"Jul 21, 2023","Excellent movie. The story is so enjoyable, scoring is really great, visual is decent, and the voice is stunning",9
"Jul 13, 2023","This is a good movie, but not a great movie. I'm very glad that it exists because the MCU would be in a much worse position if it didn't, but The Avengers plays it safe when it comes to the plot. Everything with Captain America and Iron Man was great, but the subplot with Black Widow and the Hulk was pretty forgettable. I'd say this is probably your average Marvel movie in terms of quality.",7
"Apr 18, 2023","Quite a serious film at times that has inappropriate comic relief, but still it kind of all works. It I had to nit pick it was more of skirmish than a full on army battling the heroes.",8
"Apr 11, 2023","A great way to end Phase One in a fantastic way with a great story, excellent writing and powerful pacing.",9
"Mar 15, 2023","I remember the excitement of the times when it was enough to bring together six heroes in a film to electrify the environment. Nowadays, six heroes in a film is little more than the few that are present. Sure, the film isn't perfect and, after all, watching it isn't even anything special. But the legacy it carries with it is unique. As Scorsese would say, welcome to roller coaster.",7
"Feb 23, 2023",One of my personal favorite marvel movies the story one of the best Tom Hiddleston makes a excellent performance as Loki and is one of the best superhero movies of all time.,9
"Dec 20, 2022","Imposible no ponerle un 10 a esta obra de arte, la unión de estos superhéroes de diferentes películas que cambio todo",10
"Oct 21, 2022",One of the best Marvel films even to this day. Even if you do not care for Marvel you will still love this.,9
"Aug 27, 2022",Every time I watch this movie it wows me. Its a great movie. I have only about 3 minor nit picks.,9
"Aug 6, 2022","Amazing, he's a force he doesn't fail he's impressive, he knows how to work with details and it's a project of performance and excitement.",10
"Jul 20, 2022",It's okay. It's an average superhero team up movie. Nothing too great. Some cool action and funny scenes. A lot of the movie drags on and is boring. The guy in the theatre beside me fell asleep during the climax. It's meh,5
"Jul 6, 2022","Continuing the epic big-screen adventures started in Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger, Marvel's The Avengers is the superhero team up of a lifetime.",5
"Jun 23, 2022","Great film, had a lot pressure, but finally, after a nobody-wanted 1st half, it finds itself, and becomes something.",6
"Jun 6, 2022",I watched the movie in cinemas when I was 17 years old but it’s really the best movie and it’s really exciting. All six superheroes came together to take down evil. I give this 10/10,10
"May 21, 2022","Surely entertaining movie: great action and visual effects. In addition you have many superheroes, so if you dont like one (I dont like Iron man and Captain America), there are plenty others. The story is epic. Also the villain is great: Loki is not easy to fully understand control and therefore always interesting.",9
"May 12, 2022","The Avengers is the first super blockbuster in the Marvel film universe. For 2012, it was something new, such crossovers have not yet been released. The Avengers is the first really cool movie in the Marvel film universe. Good completion of the first phase.",8
"May 8, 2022",Super corny but is fun as hell to watch wish Joss Whedon could have kept this same energy for Avengers Age of Ultron.,8
"May 7, 2022",sürükleyici ortalama süper kahraman filmidir çok fazla beklentiye girmemek lazım idare eder,6
"Apr 24, 2022","What have we done to deserve this? These films with non-existent directing, with shots that say nothing from the contents that are not there, are unfortunately taking away space from real cinema.",0
"Apr 21, 2022","The Avengers. This is an Avengers-level threat! A real movie boom! Assemble a team of superheroes and watch them fight. All the actors performed their roles perfectly, and the title theme is forever recorded in the memory.",10
"Apr 6, 2022","Simply excellent in its entirety. Charismatic villain, a good story and a great cgi",9
"Mar 25, 2022","The Avengers is groundbreaking. Never before has there been five movies about characters who team up in one big film. In that case, The Avengers is one of the most ambitious films of all-time.",10
"Mar 13, 2022","The Avengers is a movie that on paper should not have worked, but in the end it manages to not only juggle its multiple characters effortlessly, but it is also one of the most entertaining superhero blockbusters ever made. A comic book movie that isn't afraid or embarrassed to be a comic book movie, The Avengers is a delight from start to finish.",8
"Mar 9, 2022","Superhero films are always fun to watch when they are done right, and while to some degree it is understandable why people wouldn't be totally enamoured with it(as seen in a lot of the negative comments, a lot of them being condescending though- enough with the ignorant conspiracy theories already!- and some not even worthy of being called reviews) Avengers Assemble for me was an example of a fun and intelligent superhero film that was done right. True, the story is formulaic but not to the extent that was too distracting. In fact my only two complaint was to do with one performances that didn't quite work personally. And that was Jeremy Renner who was rather on the dull side as Hawkeye, whose character development did seem a little rushed and underwritten, that Hawkeye has inner demons is made very clear but it could have come through more strongly. However the rest of the performances were great, a big shout out going to Tom Hiddleston who is serpentine personified as Loki, though Robert Downey Jnr's charismatic Iron Man, Samuel L. Jackson's no-nonsense Nick Fury, Mark Ruffalo's very confident Hulk(he doesn't make you miss Eric Bana or Ed Norton), Chris Hemsworth's dynamic and not wimpy Thor(if he was I put it down to his hidden demons character development) and Chris Evans' modest, heartfelt Captain America were equally great. Scarlett Johansson convinces mostly too, Black Widow's back story is intriguing and Johansson is wonderful when she acts fearless but when in her emotional, imploring moments her acting is rather forced and out of character for Black Widow. For a film with as many characters as seen here, Avengers Assemble still makes a vast majority of them very interesting(only Hawkeye really disappointed), in character and not one-sided and all of them have their turn to shine. It didn't feel to me like a film that tried to cram in too many heroes all at once for the sake of it. The film is very slickly made with astounding special effects and dazzlingly executed stunt-work. Alan Silvestri's score pulsates with power and the action sequences are exciting. The story may be formulaic and standard good-and-evil but is crisply paced and intelligently handled with just the right blend of humour, pathos and action with not one component over-shadowing the others. What was really enjoyable especially was the toe-to-toe with Thor and Iron Man and Hulk. What was really remarkable was the script, filled with thoughtful exposition and snappy banter that stayed true to The Avengers while also with Joss Whedon's own style that was apparent in a lot of his other work. Overall, Avengers Assemble may not be 100% perfect or among the best ever but it is still an outstanding film with a lot to love about it, and no this is not coming from a fake account or a plant, just someone who can be hard to please who genuinely enjoyed it. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9
"Jan 19, 2022","Strong start for the Avengers franchise. However, IW and Endgame were much better.",10
"Jan 5, 2022","Revisiting this movie, it doesn't hold up quite as well as it did at the time. It's still definitely watchable and amazing that they were finally able to get all of these characters together in one movie, but some of the dialogue is a bit cheesy and it seems like they were really intent on finding reasons for the heroes to fight each other, even if it doesn't make much sense. It was easy to overlook the faults at the time because it was so amazing that Captain America and Iron Man were in the same movie, but they have definitely done better team up movies since. I also don't remember the costumes being as silly as they are. Black Widow and Cap basically look like they are wearing pajamas.",7
"Dec 30, 2021",----------------------------------8.4/10-----------------------------------,8
"Dec 13, 2021","Having been one of the biggest success films ever is its gift and its curse. It's a grandiose and unforgettable visual spectacle, it has the most creative shots in the MCU, the action scenes are shocking and some characters have their best roles in this film.
All mentioned is the gift of the movie and the curse is that it has our full attention only in that aspects, because the film has a great script, round, complete and with great value, but they almost force you to ignore the story as such and just enjoy the fights.
I have watch it again and my experience was totally different now that I was paying attention to the script.",8
"Dec 2, 2021","I might be in the minority here I still really like this movie but this movie has not aged as well as people say it is. Again when this movie first came out in 2012 it was the first time we've seen heroes team up so it was tons of fun and it felt like a masterpiece, but the new Avengers movies are much better in my opinion and certain things of the movie feel flat. The visuals loom strange, the action is cool but not great, and the story was okay.",7
"Dec 1, 2021",As revolutionary as it was in 2013 it feels incomplete and lackluster in 2021,5
"Oct 25, 2021","While The Avengers exhibits exemplary craftsmanship, Joss Whedon hasn’t made",10

"Sep 28, 2021",I saw this movie when I was 8 years old and I had a fit of nostalgia when I saw it again.,9
"Sep 23, 2021",The first movie I saw of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and today I still love it as if it were the first time I saw it.,9
"Sep 18, 2021","I did not like this movie as much as i remembered. I can't really explain why. It of course is not a bad movie, there is not a thing as a bad marvel movie, its still a fine movie, just not up to what i expect from marvel.",6
"Sep 18, 2021",La primera de Avengers es de las mejores del género  y hoy en día sigue siendo una buen ejemplo de como hacer una película de un grupo de superhéroes.,9
"Sep 17, 2021","I found a few inaccuracies in the plot, but they are insignificant. Good fight choreography.",8
"Sep 6, 2021","Avengers was the movie that propelled Marvel Studios to fame.
This is one of those movies that marked a before and after in the cinema.",9
"Aug 8, 2021",Great movie with solid plot to it only problem is the plot armor holes that happen throughout the film that set up thing to happen perfectly,9
"Aug 2, 2021",I loved this when I first saw it at least it’s better than the second one but the third and fourth one are my top 2 favorite,10
"Apr 28, 2021","The Avengers was the first movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that I learnt about. Everyone was going crazy. Meanwhile I, who didn't know the basics of comic book superheroes, was wondering why are Superman, Batman and Spider-Man not on the cover of this movie. Just a few years ago I watched all the movies from the franchise when Infinity War came out just to know what the fuss was all about. And now that I see it, I understand why it was such a huge deal.

After the events of Thor, Loki comes on earth to steal the Tesseract from SHIELD, and he does manage to do that. Meanwhile all the superheroes are getting their own relations straight so that they can team up and fight the bad guy. All the characters are shown to be in the places where they had been at the end of their respective movies. Although what they are doing is not very interesting, it is somewhat a realistic deptiction of what kinds of characters they are. And then they all come together, beat Loki and save the day. A pretty straightforward story moved by character development.

There are a number of things I like about this movie. The scene where their airship's propeller stops working so Iron Man spins it so fast that it stabilises. It showed how strong and fast Iron Man is. There was also the scene where Iron Man goes through the portal and throws the missile away. It completely contradicts what Captain America considered him to be, showing how his character developed over the duration of the movie. I also like how Tony goes to have a word with Loki and tells him that the Avengers have a Hulk against his entire army. I mean I could literally go on about what a badass Iron Man was throughout the movie.

Then there were Thor and Hulk. I really liked Thor ever since I first heard of him. He literally looks like a Norse god capable of highly destructive powers. Hulk, on the other hand, I didn't like him very much when I heard about him. Even in The Incredible Hulk he wasn't really entertaining. But here he actually feels like a very strong guy who has been trapped in the body of Bruce Banner. He gets angry every time someone calls him Bruce instead of Hulk, which shows how much he is struggling for his identity. Thor is just as awesome as I thought him to be. I always have a soft spot for superheroes who wear a cape.

The visual effects were done really nicely. Though the impact of their powers wasn't very hard, but it's a campy movie. What can we possibly expect? It's from an era where every fight scene needed to have a comic relief who would tell jokes in the middle of the fight, be it Gimli from Lord of the Rings, Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars or Hound from Transformers. But the destruction was surely visible. Most of the shots are done from the point of view of a bystander. That is something I really like; it's literally the reason why I like Monsterverse. It is seen especially in the scene where Hulk rides the giant snake robot.

Though there are a lot of things that I didn't like about this movie. First of all, the campiness. Obviously in today's time it's quite an easy thing to dismiss saying that back in 2012 movies were meant to be campy as the superhero genre hadn't been utilised properly, but the very same year The Dark Knight Rises came and the next year Man of Steel came. Both of them had the mature touch to it. Even the MCU movies before and after this one like Thor and Captain America: The Winter Soldier looked more mature than this baby thing. The other criticism I have towards this is Black Widow and Hawkeye. I hate botht he characters, and even more I hate how they are easily beating bad guys who are clearly stronger than them.

The jump cuts of this movie are also very annoying. Every fight scene, especially the ones which have Black Widow in them, have like, a dozen scene cuts just to show that Natasha did a cartwheel, got on the bad guy's shoulders and snapped his neck. The same goes for Captain America and Hawkeye also. Not even once has Hawkeye shot anything in one take. It's something that can be easily shown even with a stunt double.

Obviously this doesn't look special anymore, since I watched it after Infinity War had released, so there wasn't much of a surprise other than the fact that it's a team up movie. It has a good place in my memory so I wouldn't want to rewatch it and tamper its reputation. It's good in its place, it's a product of its time. It should stay that way. It's a one time watch in case you haven't seen it.",8
"Apr 24, 2021","Still great all this time later. First of it's kind, and still one of the best of it's kind.",9
"Mar 28, 2021","Beautifully brings over the themes of each of the main characters' standalone films and manages to naturally bring them together. The 3rd act is truly epic, containing some of the best action in the entire MCU, and is the first film in the MCU to succeed as a completion of its themes. Not all of its main characters are created equal, though, as some are more compelling than others (cough cough, Thor). The villain also loses his intimidation too quickly into the 3rd act.",9
"Mar 14, 2021",Отличный фильм для фанатов вселенной. С удовольствием провёл 2+ часа в выходные,8
"Mar 13, 2021","With a solid plot, a fantastic cast, and great actors, The Avengers is a really good superhero movies. All of the characters have very interesting relationships with each other - some of bond, others of contempt. Even though this film isn’t nearly as well written as some of its predecessors (particularly Iron Man,) it gets the job done. The directing is fine and the action suffices. Overall, this is a really good, action-packed, yet not surface level movie.",8
"Mar 11, 2021",my favorite movie ever from 2012! this movie is one of the best movies from 2012 in my opinion!,10
"Jan 30, 2021","I've been a fan of the superhero genre since I was a child. Superheroes fascinate me because they have superhuman abilities and they can accomplish amazing feats that a regular human can't. And what I like more than a movie with a superhero is a movie with multiple superheroes! I love team-ups. When I first saw this movie back in 2012, it blew my goddamned mind. The scale of it, the number of superheros, the CGI. I honestly believed this movie was the peak of superhero movies and that nothing will ever beat it. In retrospective, I was of course wrong... Fortunately.

Not only is this movie very good on its own, but the fact that there was a build-up to it from the previous movies that also established our main characters makes it even better. I watched all the other movies that lead up to The Avengers. I absolutely love the cohesion of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",10
"Jan 21, 2021",The Avengers is a beautiful example on how movies like this should be done! Deliver all the action a summer blockbuster should offer while also giving us a great group of well developed characters that we care about when the stakes are high.,10
"Jan 20, 2021","This is a meh bright movie for children 13 and under. That being said, It's also loaded with Lame comedy and unnecessary sexual content.",1
"Jan 15, 2021","The last hour is a lot of fun, but I found the opening chunk disappointing.

I was expecting wall-to-wall action, pretty much from the start - especially given the forces that join together. However, I felt the first half of 'The Avengers' as slow. What also didn't help is that the villain, carried over from a preceding MCU film, isn't super interesting - we also don't see the antagonist's earlier film counterpart for a fair few scenes, which felt too delayed.

The last half is much better, which allowed me to enjoy myself properly. Robert Downey Jr., while not as entertaining as he is on his own, brings goodness, as do the likes of Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth.

I'm not a big fan of recasts, though Mark Ruffalo as Hulk is a positive one; even if that took a bit away from the novelty of all the superheroes joining, given we hadn't seen Ruffalo himself before. Added to Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, at least in terms of the film franchise, getting major screen time out of nowhere - having been a bit part character in her debut MCU appearance.

The music is noteworthy, while everything looks brilliant. Overall and in short: It's a fun, good action film - I just expected greater.",7
"Oct 31, 2020","That's right, this movie exists. And I am very much happy! I knew being a Marvel geek would satisfy me. I watched this with my family while we picked which characters we represent. I had the time of my life. Well done to Whedon, the cast, and every single person involved.",10
"Oct 7, 2020",I thought it would be hard to pull off uniting all these heroes in one film. But Joss Whedon pulled it off effortlessly. This was a fantastic end to phase one with some great action and great story telling. Loki as the villain was a great touch as he performed perfectly. Having all these heroes interact for the first time on screen was special. This film is very easy to rewatch over and over.,8
"Sep 25, 2020","It feels small compared to Infinity War and Endgame, and that's great. I love seeing this characters meet for the first time. I love to see them talk and argue (although it can be a little grating on rewatch since we've already see them become friends).

Those are my favorite moments of this movie. Scenes like Tony talking to Bruce about how the Hulk saved his life, Steve and Coulson chatting on the way to the helicarrier and Steve and Tony arguing about sacrifice (something which will be payed off in Endgame).

It's simple. You take a bunch of characters I like and put them in a room together. That's what most of this movie is and that's why I like it so much. The action is great and all, but it's those little moments that keep me returning.

Also, the scene with Loki in Germany is one of the best scenes in all of the MCU.

Is it perfect? No. Is it corny? Of course. Is it as emotionally effective as future movies? No.
But it's still a damn good time.",8
"Sep 22, 2020",Marvel has been building up to this since Iron Man and it has established the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe).,8
"Sep 9, 2020","In 2012, Marvel launched the Avengers film series, where the last episode became the most profitable film in the world. For the first part, they probably didn't expect what success is behind this series. The story is excellent. Especially ingenious in how Marvel managed to connect all the superheroes nicely and make a film about them. The work was probably not easy to make a movie with so many superheroes, but it worked. Every superhero has a moment here and it doesn't seem overpaid. The story is excellent and the main villain Loki is, in my opinion, one of the best villains Marvel has ever had. Overall, this is an excellent action spectacle that I can recommend.",8
"Jul 10, 2020",NO **** **** AWESOME....THIS MOVIE....REALLY IS. I give it 1000/10! I love Marvel so much,10
"Jul 1, 2020","This to me is still the best Marvel movie ever. Joss Whedon perfectly manages a large group of charasmatic characters with big egos played by an amazing cast of actors. After phase 1 we are treated to this incredible, inspired battle royale. The mischievous Loki (Hiddleston) with some mysterious influence attacks New York with a galactic army of Aliens. Good thing sassy Iron Man played by an amazing Robert Downey Jr., mega hunky with inspired comic timing Thor (Hemsworth), sexy Hawkeye (Renner), the fierce Hulk (Ruffalo) and gorgeous all American boy Captain America (Evans). But the real scene stealer here is a kick ass, smart, fantastically executed Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson. The movie is definitely one of the best of it's kind as well as being one of the most entertaining ever made.

"May 14, 2020",Der Film von voner bis hinten gut man hat alle Helden aus den bisherigen Marvel Filmen gut mit einander verknüpft der Bösewicht hat mir sehr gut gefallen und die New York Battle Szene ist einfach nur Genial,10
"May 12, 2020",The Avengers does not contain the romantic and intriguing story or the deep and thematic emotional weight that the origin stories of the titular characters do. This film could still have the potential of being a fun action flick yet fails due to its only powerless heroine being undermined and overshadowed by its main powerful male heroes.,0
"Apr 19, 2020","Uma das melhores junções de heróis já feitas, com momentos épicos e uma atmosfera única.

Diversos elementos nesse filme funcionam muito bem. Temos personagens que, por si só, já são interessantes e carismáticos, e esse até então não era o desafio. Acontece que o roteiro sabe muito bem como conduzir a visão de cada um sem que isso parecesse forçado, na realidade, até se acrescenta ao personagem. Isso fica muito mais evidente para quem assistiu os filmes subsequentes e percebe muito bem referências que são, na realidade, futuras a trama. Loki é super carismático e fez com que amássemos o odiar, ocupando perfeitamente o papel do vilão. O início da relação entre o Cap. América e Tony Stark é no mínimo intrigante, e cada um parece ter sua verdade em determinados momentos.

Se tem uma coisa que funciona bem aqui é o alívio cômico. Nos pega em momentos certeiros, são bem engraçados e quebra o clima pesado - que não é o propósito do filme. As cenas de luta são boas de modo geral, com claro destaque aquelas onde o plano é mais aberto e se utilizam dois ou mais heróis, combinando seus poderes; é lindo e extremamente satisfatório de se ver. A OST é marcante e funcional. Emociona e representa muito bem a equipe. Os efeitos especiais são excelentes para a época e convencem muito bem.",9

"Jan 5, 2020",This is not a good movie... It's a GREAT MOVIE! Filmmakers did an awesome job taking the storyline from the comic books and making sure that most of it were kept.,9
"Jan 5, 2020",Stan Lee cameos are the best! It's too bad he won't be around to do that now. It was one of the things I looked forward to in each of the Marvel movies.,10
"Jan 4, 2020",The best thing about this movie is that it gave each superhero their own unique way of contributing to the team. It wasn't just another film wherein there's one superhero that stands out among the rest while the rest got overshadowed by this main character.,10
"Jan 3, 2020","More than just a superhero film, this movie had a definite soul and smart plot as well. It's a guarantee that superhero fans will love it but at the same time, other, more common, moviegoers will find it entertaining too.,",10
"Jan 3, 2020",Are you a fan of epic adventure movies? Then this is your dream come true! Truly this is the ultimate superhero mash-up and it's executed perfectly. Props to the filmmakers for taking the time to design it to be more than just a superhero film packed with action scenes and adding depth to each character.,10
"Jan 2, 2020",Marvel really outdid themselves on this one. This is one of their greatest works to date and only a handful of films can compare to this one - and all of them have mostly been Marvel too!,10
"Jan 2, 2020","The title says it all, you will really MARVEL at the awesomeness of this film. Where else can you find a film with more superheroes than you can imagine working together to save the Earth?",10
"Jan 2, 2020",I'm not exaggerating when I say that this is the best superhero film of all time!,10
"Jan 2, 2020","I gotta admit I was not ready for all that shaky-cam action. I mean, you could clearly see that the choreography for the fight scenes was good enough for a superhero movie, but why did you have to add so much shaking and cutscenes?",10
"Jan 2, 2020",I appreciate how they made sure to introduce each character before bringing them together for an epic fight to defend the Earth. It gives much more depth to each superhero.,10
"Jan 2, 2020",It was a great idea to bring together this group of amazing superheroes and at the same time amazing actors to create a top-class superhero film.,9
"Dec 30, 2019",Good fighting sequences but camerawork feels too crazy and made it quite difficult to fully enjoy the great choreography.,9
"Dec 29, 2019","If you haven't seen this film yet, do yourself a favor and remain unspoiled. This is one of the movies that need to be savored.",10
"Dec 29, 2019",Kudos to the fight choreographers who designed all the action sequences for this movie. They really did a good one!,10
"Dec 24, 2019",The cast really delivered. Sure they were playing the roles of superheroes but you can really see and feel a deeper level of emotions in their performance.,10
"Dec 23, 2019",One of the many things I loved in this film was the conflict between Iron Man and Captain America for leadership and how the two differ in their approach. A very unique way of building a team of superheroes.,10
"Dec 23, 2019",One word for this movie: AWESOME. It’s an amazing film and has everything a superhero fanboy hoped for and more.,10
"Dec 23, 2019","Avengers
I tried my best to avoid getting carried away by the hype of this movie because nowadays most of the movies that are too much hyped end up just being disappointments but I'm glad to say that I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED when this came out.",8
"Dec 12, 2019","Fun and well made. Good story, maybe not the most crazy story with lots of twists etc but still good and fun movie to watch and keeps you interested throughout.",8
"Nov 8, 2019","When you have a bunch of flashy superheroes fighting supernatural, extraterrestrial villains from another dimension, it can get pretty hard to highlight each of their strengths,  but Marvel pulled it off with this one!",10
"Nov 8, 2019",Wonderful movie to watch if you want to be entertained and not think about the plot too much.,9
"Nov 6, 2019",Perfect casting! You can really see and feel that the actors have great chemistry both in and out of their characters.,9
"Nov 6, 2019",I found it creative of Marvel to introduce each character one by one. It really set the tone and had me looking forward to what's gonna happen.,10
"Nov 6, 2019","Definitely the greatest superhero movie of all time. Marvel has set the bar high with this one and so far, they're doing a good job of keeping up with that despite not being able to raise it higher!",10
"Nov 6, 2019","The Avengers is a dream movie come true for superhero fans with its group of extremely talented actors and epic champions, to create an action- packed movie with hilarious banter laced in between scenes. I love how each of the actors and actresses has portrayed each of the roles they were given.",7
"Oct 20, 2019","This is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best Marvel movie. It's the perfect end of the MCU's first act. You see the personalities we've been exposed to throughout the past movies finally clash, and there's a perfect amount of banter and golden interactions that make it so, so worth it. There is not a single wasted moment in this film, every single scene serves a myriad of good purposes for both the film's plot progressing, making us laugh, investing us in characters, developing unique relationships... the list goes on. Really, the only place this movie stagnates is the final act and the final battle, which gets a little hard to watch after some time because it just drags on for so long. But if a movie only loses my interest slightly on one part but still manages to give me goosebumps with amazing dialogue and line delivery after the 30th time I've watched it? Hey, no skin off my nose. It just **** that this director went on to direct the worst Marvel movie after this. Oh well!",10
"Sep 15, 2019","PROS: deftly mixes action, comedy and drama; ably divides the protagonism between all the 7 heroes in a more balanced way than any film of it's kind has done before; captivating and amusing narrative that never loses it's great self-aware sense of humor, charm and humanity, from beginning to end; enthusiastic and convincing performances from all the actors, that seem to really care for their respective nuanced and flawed characters; many compelling interactions between the heroes and between them and the charismatic and witty villain; fluid camera work, spectacular set pieces, enjoyable fight choreography and impressive CGI animations; apt and memorable soundtrack; ""Hulk, smash!"".
CONS: it's necessary to have watched the films 'Ironman', 'Ironman 2', 'Captain America: The First Avenger', 'The Incredible Hulk' and 'Thor', or at least watched a youtube summary of each of them, to be able to understand and comprehend the story completely; the concept of super-heroes having to save the Earth from invading alien foes is not exactly original.

""Loki: [to a crowd] Kneel before me! I said... KNEEL! [the crowd kneels] Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It's the unspoken truth of humanity that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power. For identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel.""

""Steven Rogers (Captain America): [to Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow)] There's only one God ma'am and I’m pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.""

"Jul 27, 2019","Very enjoyable movie, characters are great with lots of chemistry between each other. Good fun!",7
"Jul 24, 2019","It was cool seeing them all together but once the hype wore off and I saw it a second time I realized there wasn't much to it

It was fun, but not really that great. Basic.

It ruined Loki as a villain by using a joke to beat him. Seeing a character they established as a pretty compelling character in the first Thor turned into a punchline was dumb, and regardless of what people say he's never recovered from the puny God scene.

Nowhere as good as it is claimed to be.",5
"Jul 8, 2019",Avengers assemble or the avengers is the 6th movie in the marvel cinematic universe it’s what the past 5 movies have been building up to those being Iron Man (2008) The Incredible Hulk (2008) Iron man 2 (2010) Thor (2011) Captain America The First Avenger (2011) to the general public marvel was still a mixed bag being highly received with Iron man then hulk was just bad iron man 2 was mixed Thor was received ok but was still mixed same with Captain America but Avengers is what people refer to as the start of the mcu as it revolutionized cinema history with a team up superhero movie with like able characters great acting good action a good villain and music and writing everything you would want in a superhero movie is here but one thing to note this movie is very corny which has changed over the cinematic universe on a huge scale but I will now explain the plot. So S.H.I.E.L.D gets hold of a mysterious cube called the Tesseract which opens up a portal bringing Loki the villain of Thor (2011) to earth using his scepter he brings Eric Selvig from the Thor movie and Clint Barton or Hawkeye under mind control he escapes and Nick Fury requests to bring together the Avengers. Meanwhile we see Natasha Rominoff or black widow from Iron Man 2 (2010) dealing with what I can assume is mob bosses in a rail yard she defeats all of them and gets in contact with Fury. Then we see Bruce Banner now payed by Mark Ruffalo instead of Eric Norton get tricked by a little girl to get brung to a house to speak with Natasha about the Avengers he accepts the help research gammo radiation in the Tesseract. Then we see Tony Stark patching a pipe undersea with his Iron Man suit after having a glass of champagne with his girlfriend Pepper Potts Phil Coulson an agent from shield comes to ask Tony to help with their Loki problem he accepts. And once more we see Steve Rodgers or Captain America still dealing with the effects of waking up 70 years into the future with everything he knows gone Nick Fury asks him to join the team and he accepts but seems scared because he knows the power it unleashes and I quote “You should have left it in the ocean” Loki is now in Germany for whatever reason and while at a party uses a mans eye to unlock a door when telling a speech to the Germans Captain America shows up and try’s to kidnap him and bring him to shield then Iron Man shows up and Loki surrenders while getting back to shield Thor lands on the jet roof and retrieves Loki Iron man and Captain America follow him then the 3 fight become friends and bring Loki back to shield while in his cell he manages to trick Thor into getting it which was made to hold the hulk and drop him from the helicarrier then a quarter of the helicarrier explodes and Phil dies leaving Cap and Iron man to repair it by Iron man spinning one of the turbines so after the explosion happens banner hulks out jumps off the ship Loki manages to open another portal to let in the Chitauri meanwhile Natasha try’s to bring Hawkeye out of mind control. With the Chitauri attacking the city the avengers help to stop it and after Banner comes back he hulks out to fight the government sees no other option but to launch a nuke towards the city so Iron Man carries the missile through the portal and at the Chitauri base and the world is saved the avengers get some food and part ways to star in their own solo movies and the movie ends. Sure it’s corny sure some parts are boring but it’s a great movie grossing over 1 billion at the box office and making marvel the money making powerhouse it is today so with everything it’s ever done I’m going to give it a 9/10,9
"Jun 1, 2019","The movie that started a revolution. There's nothing more to say except that Joss Whedon nails the ensemble cast and brings together the characters many fans know and love. Whatever connection one has to the MCU or comics, this movie is sure to delight with fun action, engaging team dynamics, and a compelling villain. Everything one could ask for from a fun superhero action adventure.",8
"May 22, 2019","Das erste Zusammentreffen der Avengers ist ein in sich gelungener, epischer und witziger Film, der nur an manchen Stellen so seine Längen hat und einer der besten Marvel-Filme ist, nur abgeschlagen von Spiderman Homecoming, Avengers 3 und Avengers 4.",8
"May 6, 2019",Wow. What a film. This may possibly the best superhero movie of all time and one of the best movies of all time. The Avenger movies are usually a lot more dramatic and action oriented then just the origin marvel movies but despite that I laughed quite a lot watching this movie. Hulk was absolutely hilarious.,10
"May 1, 2019",Mediocre at best. Overrated trash. trash trash trash trash trash trash trash!,4
"Apr 26, 2019","The best of the Avengers films until Endgame came along. Joss Whedon's screenplay is fantastic, with a few hiccups, but it doesn't detract from the experience.",9
"Apr 25, 2019","One of the top 3 MCU movies. Record setting and it did the characters justice. A bit over the top with acrobatics of some of the characters , but the story was good. A nod to the charismatic villain Loki (Tom Hiddleston). This is the best Avengers movie in my opinion. If they had only kept this formula going , but alas , Hollywood and Disney gotta get bigger and bigger.",9
"Apr 23, 2019","This is what started the reign of really good films in the MCU. It's action-packed, funny, and everyone has great onscreen chemistry.",10
"Apr 14, 2019","Marvel logra lo hasta el momento imposible y logra reunir a su grupo más importante de héroes y hacerles justicia en pantalla a todos, en lo que se puede llamar una de las mejores películas de acción hechas.
El teseracto, un artefacto misterioso para S.H.I.E.L.D. cae en manos de Loki, quien encomendado por un enemigo superior se prepara para invadir la tierra por lo que es necesario formar a los Avengers para controlar la situación.
Nadie podía creer que Iron Man, Thor, Hulk y el Capitán América podían compartir una película juntos y dar una entrega de calidad. Divertida, dramatica y con escenas de acción memorables, incluso dándole justicia a Hawkeye y Viuda Negra.
Esta es una película que apenas tiene defectos, no es perfecta, pero innova en una forma que trasciende esos pormenores.
Recomendable para todos, incluso quiénes no hayan visto las películas anteriores de Marvel. ""The Avengers"" es un éxito que vale la pena ver.",10
"Apr 12, 2019",Definitely one of the best Marvel films with plenty of humour and awesome effects. Hulk is perfect. Loki is a little lame.,7
"Apr 9, 2019","Joss Whedon strikes the door hard and what's visible is Kevin Feige's dream team.

The Avengers

Whedon is much better a writer than he is a director. On a scale of McQuarrie, disappointingly Joss Whedon, the director, wouldn't even qualify as one. For when it comes to map the ever longed battles by the fans, he takes things lightly a lot. Whatever glory that bedazzles you on the screen, is a pure feat of bravery on paper not on screen. Too much cheese and too much sweet, his self-earned jaw dropping moments, are spoiled by him by the bitter afterbirth of his fandom. Fortunately, these battles are here as the starters, the main course is the ""build-up"" to that battle.

Whether then you watch gleefully these characters argue egotistically or see a train of awe-gasping moves by them to overpower each other on screen. There lies a profound poetry between these moments where you can see 8 year old Whedon playing with his toys in his room, creating banal engaging scenarios between Captain and Tony. This crowd pleasing franchise saw the maybe-expected uplift from this chapter, as it managed to bring out every adored content, from humor to drama to juicy visual effects. The dollars were written in the script and so it was visible on screen.

Among all the triumphs of Whedon, his biggest is combining these behemoth figures and weave out a compelling conversation that is worth ten times any battle shown. Downey is the singular actor that comes out with a sigh, his performance isn't interfered by the intertwining of multiple plots, which it seems like it did to others. If aligned the priorities of the makers, the characteristics of the characters that evolves into an essential element in the storytelling, is their way in, for this safe formula wasn't inscrutable enough to convince us that these guys, The Avengers, can avenge.",7
"Mar 17, 2019","Marvel's The Avengers does a splendid job at bringing together some of the best superheroes to form The Avengers team from the comics. Marvel's The Avengers is my favorite movie of 2012, one of my top 10 favorite Marvel and superhero movies, and one of my favorite movies of all time. The visual effects and the action and fighting scenes were spectacular and awesome especially Hulk and the battle at the end of the movie. The acting was stupendous especially from Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Jeremy Renner, Clark Gregg, Samuel L. Jackson, and Cobie Smulders. The costume designs were fantastic. The production design was terrific. The writing and screenplay were excellent. The story was really cool and interesting. A+.",10

"Mar 6, 2019","78/100

""I have an army - We have a hulk"" The Avengers is a good movie. If you look at all of the movies, this is one of the most important because all the heroes We've seen meet and form a team. Loki remains among the most interesting villains. The first act and the third especially are great, but the second is kind of meh.Some scenes are filmed very well (I know which scene I refer to) and some have so many cuts ... The dialogue is sometimes bad, but the humor is good.",8
"Dec 5, 2018","Wow. This movie come out six years ago. When is first came out no one was sure if they could pull it off but they did. They pulled it off and exceeded expectations. The movie was all about characters and they frequently struggle to work together and seeing them come together to fight a common foe and banter and fight, and eventually prevail is super engaging. Every character has a very good place in the film and gets enough screen-time except for Hawkeye who's barley in it and Loki's motivations felt very flat and stereotypical. The action was off the walls crazy and entertaining and seeing it for the first time in theaters blows your mind. The comedy is on point, the character development, the plot is passable but isn't really the main focus. It's all about bringing everyone together and making a fun action blockbuster that you will remember till the day you die.",9
"Nov 15, 2018","Mediocre action flick with shallow characters, there is no threat from mass cgi villains and unpopular opinion a crap main villain. Loki is stood up to by an elderly man and tossed about like a turd in the wind.",5
"Oct 29, 2018","Amazing crossover with characters from different movies and surprisingly it fits perfectly. Every character has their personality and details, none of them are plain.",10
"Sep 25, 2018","The action scenes are spectacularly exciting, with excellent use of visuals and CGI. I loved seeing the heroes argue and not getting along, and seeing them working together and just beating the crap out of everything.",8
"Sep 19, 2018","The Avengers is the first team-up film in the MCU and follows the crew as they argue for a while before teaming up to fight some aliens that are invading Earth thanks to Loki opening up a portal. Even when I watched The Avengers for the first time back in 2012, I didn't think that the story was all that special. This is a long film, and for most of it we just sit around watching the heroes talk. There are a few action set pieces throughout the film, such as when Thor, Loki, and Iron Man (and Captain America) have a pretty awesome scuffle, but besides that it's a whole lot of chatter and not a whole lot of anything else. And it doesn't help that these conversations aren't particularly interesting. The final battle in the city is cool, but there's nothing particularly jaw-dropping about it either. The story here is just...okay. I will say that having watched the first Captain America film it was cool to see Steve interact with the son of a man that he considered a friend, and slowly realize that he's a bit of a ****. Steve and Tony's dynamic is by far the most entertaining in the film (and possibly the MCU, which makes sense given the future these two have). As to be expected by this point with MCU films, the cinematography is great. Of course, this is also the film where we get the iconic shot of The Avengers as they assemble on the battlefield, which was cool to see. In the end, though, while everything in this film is solid, I don't find it to be particularly mind-blowing. And really a big part of the reason why I don't like to watch this one very often is because of the long run-time. There's nothing in this film that makes me want to sit down for 2.5 hours and watch it, unless I'm doing an MCU marathon.",7
"Sep 18, 2018","Surprisingly good on a rewatch with my now growing children. Inconsitencies in plot and character behaviour and obviously ridiculous Hollywood ""physics"" can be overlooked with all the great action and humour on offer. A fun time",9
"Aug 3, 2018","Still my favorite mcu movie.
This movie is very great.
The jokes are funny.
The characters are great.
The main villain, loki is amazing
Avengers Assemble!",10
"Jun 24, 2018","The Avengers offers the first team up and the payoff for the build up from the different marvel films from the MCU. While this film has some good performances from all the actors involved and Tom Hiddleston stands out in this cast for his portrayal of Loki in this film. There is also other aspects which I like, including the one take sequence that happens in the final battle. However, this film has too much going on, it tries to focus on too much in this film, the different aspects include, the heroes working together in team, they also try to establish character arcs for some characters but not for others. The third and final thing which this film does is that it tries to establish a political stand point about teaming the avengers and this results in the film having too much going on. The other thing I don't like about this film is that there are some issues with the writing and finally the direction. I think this film is fine, but don't believe the hype that people have said about it.",6
"Jun 19, 2018","Marvel's The Avengers features characters which were from multiple Marvel movies and other Marvel franchises to group to save the world from a large worldscale threat. Lots of action, humor and amazing moments, enjoy this action packed film that will spawn further stories into the future.",10

"May 4, 2018","I’m a huge marvel fan but I did not enjoy this movie. It’s actually one of my least liked marvel films thus far.

In my opinion it was just soooo boring at times. So much that happened in this movie was uninteresting and a lot of things felt dumb. There was also a few to many plotholes in the story in order for me to enjoy it. I actually started to yawn at one point and wanted to take a break because I was not enjoying it. Though it got better at times but the overall experience was very disappointing.",4
"May 1, 2018","Now I'm not a huge fan of superhero flicks, so maybe there's something I'm missing here. But walking out of the theater, all I felt was that I had seen 2.5 hours of nothing but action and drama. Maybe that's its purpose? Maybe it's just not my cup of tea? For whatever reason, I was not invested. This is hardly an interesting or exciting film, and I see no reason for the rave reviews or exceptional $$ it is making.

I suppose it has something to do with being a ""fan""; as I said earlier, I am in no way a ""fan"" of hero movies but this one got such good reviews that I had to check it out. I was disappointed because, surprise surprise, it felt EXACTLY like every other superhero movie that had ever been made. Even more so since its a combination of all of the previous heroes into one film. So really, it's not original, or different, or exciting, or moving, or anything. It just IS.",8
"Apr 29, 2018",Avengers is a fantastic culmination of the first 4 years of the MCU. Incredibly fun!!!,10
"Apr 29, 2018","The long expected screenplay of the mightest, dysfunctional superhero team of Marvel Comics; each character is placed organically with his own dynamic personality. The action sequences are for fasten to the seat.",10
"Apr 28, 2018",When this movie first came out it was so epic cause never have we seen multiple super heroes franchises team up on the big screen (X-Men don't count...) The culmination of the past films leading up to this point and the interactions between all the characters made this film a pioneer. Story is the start of a bigger picture and is overlooked by a lot of people because this is the start of Thanos/Infinity Arc....,9
"Apr 25, 2018","An overall great marvel movie with a few drawbacks like ,loki was just annoying after a while in my opinion , you know what his intensions are but it gets a little bit to much repeated
Overall every superhero did great ,even hawkeye caused for trouble.
The story was pretty dull to,but great characters really make it feel like you don't really care
I really enjoyed it,including the final battle,but it is far from the greatest marvel movie",8
"Apr 24, 2018","The Avengers is a Marvel fan's big dream come true. An unprecedented ensemble movie which has since only been topped by other MCU movies in scope and breadth. The story is simple and straightforward at the expense of complexity. Pacing is way off in the middle though. Under the supervision of Nick Fury and SHIELD, 6 heroes (Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America) team up to battle Loki and his alien armada who threaten humanity with slavery. Here Thanos makes his first brief appearance in the MCU. When you see the Helicarrier take off for the first time, it's a wonder to behold. The action scenes are amazing and the heroes co-operate like a well-oiled machine. This movie opened the wider MCU to the cosmic elements for the 1st time.",9
"Apr 23, 2018",The Avengers is one of my favorite movies ever! This was one of the first MARVEL films that I saw and it got me hooked on the rest of them. I highly recommend it! It’s amazing!,10
"Apr 22, 2018","I don't think this movie was good as 'The Dark Knight Rises' which was also released in 2012, but I think this movie was quite amazing, and appealed the miraculous plan that Marvel and Kevin Feige had made. Different characters made perfect harmony.",7
"Apr 18, 2018",It was a good movie. At first I thought the 2 and a half hours of runtime were going to be a bore but it was way more fun than I expected.,7
"Apr 18, 2018","(92/100)
Finally, after five movies it is here. but it does have some problems. Namely the CGI wasn't great (especiallly on the Chitauri) and the aspect ratio was very distracting in relation to all the other MCU movies. The movie continues the characters' story in a good way and the movie connects excellently and seamlessy with the previous five movies. Overall Marvel's The Avengers is the best movie out of phase one and a solid entry in the MCU in its own right.",9
"Apr 12, 2018","The ending to Phase One is a very solid movie that does all it should. Every character gets their moment (except Hawkeye) and the action is on point. The plot may be weak but the character work in the movie makes up for all of it. This movie also becomes more and more special every year due to the rest of the MCU being heavily effected by it (see Daredevil, Spider-Man: Homecoming, basically all of the TV shows), which makes the movie feel huge in context. This movie gave me one of my best experiences in a cinema seeing all of my childhood dreams come to life on screen, love this movie.",9
"Apr 11, 2018","MCU at its best! This movie has everything, great cast, action, humor, everything is perfect. For the first time Marvel gave us a brilliant villain. Acting in the whole movie was amazing. The final battle was what we all have hoped for- to see the Avengers assembled, fighting side by side in the streets of NY was epic. My favorite MCU movie so far!",10

"Mar 15, 2018","Despite some questionable green screen around the last 3rd of the movie, The Avengers is still a ton of fun. It really was a risk trying to make this movie happen, and it really payed off.

I still preferred The Dark Knight Rises and The Amazing Spider-Man when it comes to superhero movies of 2012, but I still think this film kicks ass.",9
"Mar 12, 2018","I dislike words like ""overrated"", but if there's a time I'd use it, it's here. I almost fell asleep 50 minutes in from how boring the first and second acts are. The story is super simplistic. Characters meet for about 20 min, not much happens, then one thing happens, and that's the only thing they deal with until a big showdown at the end. Forward and stale. Might be better if you're with friends and eating some popcorn, and if you manage to make to the 50 minute mark it gets a little better, but it's really not all it's ramped up to be.",5
"Feb 26, 2018","A great MCU movie. The early stages of the MCU were so cool. It felt like watching prior movies really came to fruition by watching this one. Then again, you didn't need to see past movies to understand this one. When I first saw this I hadn't seen Captain America, but I still understood him and got his deal. It's a great movie and it's my 2nd favorite MCU movie.",10

Um filme espectacular e dos melhores no que diz respeito a Super Heróis e á sua junção. Ninguem ficou esquecido e todo o elenco foi bem trabalhado. Ainda não vi a liga da justiça mas vai ser difícil para a DC fazer um filme melhor que esse no que toca a junção de equipa. Veremos.",9

"Jan 7, 2018","This movie is actually pretty freaking awesome! The villain, Loki, is really cool and interesting and there're no more uninteresting side characters as pretty much all the characters that the movie focuses on are the superheroes. The action is fun and plentiful, the acting is good, all the intercourse between the superheroes is fun and playful and overall there are a ton of scenes that just made me smile because of how fun and cool they were. Some weird editing and occasional dragging aside, this movie is a ton of fun.",9

"Dec 26, 2017",Too much action. Too much CGI. The dialogue is corny and a-typical of bad action movies. Not a must see film.,3
"Dec 19, 2017","This movie is an absolute mess of action and misplaced character development. It does everything and nothing, resulting in a very average film that clearly displays a growing problem in this genre.",5
"Dec 14, 2017","Joss Whedon's The Avengers is a truly amazing entry in this growing Marvel Cinematic Universe, and a great film overall. I loved how the film built up it's characters and didn't just plop them together and them automatically get along. The characters didn't always get along and I loved that. All of the casting is perfect especially Tom Hiddleston's Loki. The action scenes also look amazing and the story is pretty great. In the end, I love this film and it is a great ending for Phase One of the MCU. I will give this film a 9.5/10",9
"Nov 27, 2017","A great superhero film classic. It has the perfect mix **** dynamic and fun humor. Truth be told, I prefer DC over Marvel, but there is no denying the true comic book essence and masterfulness of The Avengers. The movie was hyped a lot over the course of a couple of years or so,with tons of trailers and teasers in the individual character films in Phase 1 of the MCU, and to most people, especially comic book fans, this movie does not disappoint. Great characters, a great villain and epic action sequences make it a winner. And any true Marvel fan or comic book fan in general will start feeling that little kid in them start to jump up and down with glee at the end when the Avengers team up to save the city. I have seen a lot of reviewers here criticize the movie for having a bland or simplistic plot, but you have to remember that this movie is a direct adaptation of the Avengers origin story from the comics, which was written back in 1963, when the concept of superheroes coming together to save the planet was not considered a ""thin plot"". All in all, a great superhero movie that appeals greatly to both casual movie watchers and comic book fans. 9/10.",9
"Nov 16, 2017",The Avengers is a very well developed and extremely enjoyable movie for kids and adults to see. The Avengers are some of the best Marvel characters and characters of all time. The plot is amazing. And the action makes this film so exciting and fun to see. 10/10.,10

"Sep 13, 2017","With The Avengers, Joss Whedon had the impossible task of taking four different franchises with loose connective tissue, and bringing them all together for a massive superhero team-up adventure. And my word, does he pull it off. In fact, he absolutely nails it. These characters, as different as they are, feel like they belong together in this movie. The talent of the actors portraying them, paired with Whedon's witty dialogue, makes for excellent banter.

The movie actually gets off to a rocky start, with the first five minutes or so feeling oddly cheap, but after the title card comes up, it's an absolute blast from beginning to end. This film provided me with one of the best theater-going experiences I've ever had, and even after watching it upwards to 20 times at home, it has never gotten old.

The characters are great. The action is mind-blowing. There's tons of heart. It might not be the deepest examination of these characters that we've ever seen, but this is what blockbuster filmmaking is all about. The Avengers promised a massively fun mashup of crazy and powerful comic book characters, and Joss Whedon has masterfully fulfilled that promise.",10
"Aug 11, 2017","A fantastic, exuberant movie oozing with spectacular action and hysterical comedy. There's plenty of over-the-top moments but that's part of the film's character and they do a lot to show how engaging the Avengers are as a unit. The story is quite good but it remains obvious where the film truly excels.",8

"Jun 1, 2017","Quando foi anunciado que o filme seria dirigido por Joss Whedon,os fás ficaram com expectativas baixas em relação ao diretor e o jugaram não merecedor de um filme dessa importância dentro do universo marvel,afinal foram anos de espera para que finalmente pudesse se ver os heróis mais poderosos da terra juntos,as expectativas foram baixas mas o filme foi lançado e junto com ele as más línguas foram calada,afinal o filme foi um sucesso,os que desacreditavam começaram a acreditar,os nerds foram a loucura,as redes sócias só falavam disso,pelo simples motivo de vingadores ser um dos melhores filmes da expansão do universo cinematográfico da marvel até hoje,superando até mesmo sua estimada sequencia.

o filme que é dirigido e roteirizado por um fã e escritor de quadrinhos tem um estilo própio e se diferencia da maioria dos blockbusters,afinal o filme é lotado de referencias a cultura geek temos Shakespeare, O Senhor dos Anéis, Stephen Hawking entre varias outras espalhadas pelo filme,alem do tom comico encaixar perfeitamente no estilo de trama apresentado.
Thor: He’s my brother.

Natasha Romanoff: He killed 80 people in 2 days.

Thor: …He’s adopted.

O filme também não se preocupa em mostrar a origem,motivações,habilidades de cada membro afinal isso já tinha sido mostrado aõ longo dos anos,oque deixa muito mais espaço para que se possa produzir uma trama original e objetiva,e nisso o filme é perfeito,em 2:10 de filme,Whedon consegue nos apresentar muita coisa sem em nenhum momento o enredo ficar cansativo ou massante,alem de ele saber muito bem como desenvolver cada personagem perfeitamente sem deixar outro de lado,isso é uma coisa admirável,em um filme de um grupo de super heróis com 6 membros,era de se esperar que pelo menos um deles ficasse como personagem secundário ou não tivesse nenhuma relevância na **** cenas de ação utilizam muito bem o elemento de trabalho em equipe e as características próprias de cada personagem,tudo isso realçado por um dos melhores vilões do universo cinematográfico da marvel,afinal loki(Tom Hiddleston) se mostra tudo oque ele tinha que ser,persuativo,arrogante e carismático,conseguindo carregar com maestria o papel de vilão de uma equipe formada pelos seres mais poderosos da terra.Adicione frases marcantes,Diálogos bem construídos,um enredo espetacular e você terá o filme,não tem como ser ruim

Apesar de o filme ter alguns poucos erros de continuidade e timing,eles nunca Sobrepõem as suas qualidades,afinal o filme cumpre o trabalho de mostrar uma equipe de super-heróis e consegue com perfeição dar a profundidade e desenvolvimento necessário pra cada um.

"Dec 21, 2016","I'll just give it to you straight up, ""The Avengers"" is one of my all-time favorite superhero films. Call me a normie, disagree all you want, I really really enjoyed this film. I loved the characters, I thought the story and the writing were good, I loved the acting, I thought it was exciting, visually spectacular and often pretty funny. It was pretty much everything I could've wanted in a superhero film. I'm so happy Marvel made the film work and I definitely have to highly recommend it. Go check it out!",10
"Dec 20, 2016","The Avengers is a good movie with awesome special effects and action sequences, especially that final battle in New York. Good casting and performances all around help to also make this a good addition to the MCU.",8
"Dec 16, 2016",Joss Wheadon creates a setting where you get to see some of youre favorite Marvel heroes interacting together in a fun enjoyable way. Unfortunatly the setting of the movie is not very interesting and misses the point in a lot of ways. felt like a b-level action flick at times.,6
"Sep 3, 2016","Truly one of the most overrated movies in the past decade. It's so riddled with flaws that it's truly a shame how successful it is. Where do I begin. The villain has absolutely no motivation, your just supposed to wonder why he does what he does, and then get distracted by pretty explosions. The plot is overly simple, and could be condensed into a 40 minute TV show. The fights between avengers get in the way of the plot, and have no stakes because all the characters are invincible. There are too many main characters to keep up with, all of which are underdeveloped, so the entire movie you feel like there is something you're out of the loop about. The biggest problem overall, is that film is so set on reminding you that it's a comic book movie, and trying to pit as many hero's and villains against each other as it can in two and a half hours, that it never has anything to say. Teamwork. That's as much of a theme as I can derive from this movie that's way too long, and has much too little to say.",5
"Aug 23, 2016","This movie definitely delivers on all its hype. The movie most people could only dream of as a kid, seeing their most iconic superheros come together to fight one big enemy. The story delivered in building every one of these heroes to put by their differences and join as one to save the world. Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth stand out as the shining starts of the movie. Tom Hiddlestone once again delivers a masterpiece of acting as the villain Loki. Everyone had their part in this movie to make sure the audience was at the edge of their seats when anyone of them was in action. Definitely one of the best superhero movies out there.",9
"Aug 10, 2016",I'm a BIG HUGE fan of Marvel and DC comics. I reed a lot of comic books. I think that this movie is not very good. This film is... Okay. I was disappointed after i watch this movie. Thr Avengers movie could have been a lot better than that.,6
"Jul 29, 2016","A feast for Fanboys and FX aficionados. BUT, the story is a mess and much like Whedon's Cabin in the Woods, snarky Whedonesque dialogue cannot liven up the first hour, nor focus the last hour of ADD CG puppet theater.

Marvel's Avengers does have some redeeming qualities, the Archetypal Superhero Vs. Archetypal Superhero fights. In classic coming book fanboy fashion, we're treated to mini grudge matches between our protagonists before the penultimate battle with Norse god Loki and a host of generic alien invaders. But, this film isn't Fight Club, it's just a love letter to the Sheldon Coopers of the world and that doesn't make it a top shelf BluRay, like Watchmen.

On the bright side, Marvel's Avengers is the precursor to the emerging technology of photo-realistic CG. No less than three major FX shops and a host of smaller shops worked on this film. ILM, Weta and Digital Domain put a lot of love into this film and it shows. Also, though not shot in 3D, the conversion is top notch, much better than other celluloid conversions such as The Phantom Menace and Thor.

Whedon's film is fun, the way that a Theme Park ride is fun, don't expect Shakespeare in the Park. I give it three stars, but just barely.

Worth seeing in 3D in a bargain matinee, I wouldn't plunk down $15 for an evening IMAX show, though.",7
"Jul 26, 2016","DC fan here! I got to admit that this Marvel movie is awesome. Its humor works, its action scenes are impressive and its acting is great. My favorite moment was when a certain character humbled a ""god"" in a very interesting manner. Go, Joss Whedon!",7
"Jul 24, 2016","Marvel is able to deliver on the hype! One of the best, if not the best superhero movies ever made. Great chemistry between the heroes, intense moments, lots of marvel humor, and unbelievable action.",10
"Jul 21, 2016","The Avengers is a fun, action-packed superhero movie that brings some of Marvel's greatest heroes together with mostly entertaining results. The film features a good balance of wry humour and action, and even allows its characters to have flaws, adding enough dramatic tension to match its blockbuster scale. Tom Hiddleston shines as Loki, making him the best villain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The rest of the cast all get their chance to shine, thanks to a script that successfully gives them all a fair share of screen time. However, I did have a few issues- the climax went on a little too long for my liking, and the plot could be a bit slow- but overall, The Avengers compensates for its flaws with an action-packed plot and a talented cast. Good for superhero fans.",7

Why?

Comedy, action, adventure and sc-ifi is the perfect combination to make an antidote for a masterpiece.

I went to see this masterpiece 3 times in theatres and actually got a shirt, that's how good the movie is.",10
"May 17, 2016","""The Avengers. That's what we call ourselves; we're sort of like a team. ""Earth's Mightiest Heroes"" type thing.""

The Avengers is like a dream come true and I mean that in the truest sense of the phrase. But for me it less because of the superhero team-up movie aspect, but more so for that fact that the writer/director behind the superhero team-up movie is Joss Whedon. I remember when this movie was coming out and it was announced that Whedon was on board to write and direct and my response was: ""yeah, sure he is. I'll believe that when I see it,"" I have seen it (five times now) and it's great!

We're used to seeing multiple heroes on screen now but back in 2012 it was something special to see superheroes team up to kick ass, although granted the X-Men (who are technically mutants not superheroes I know but same difference) had been doing this since 2000, this was the Avengers, a wholly different kettle of fish.

So much care is given to each character in this movie, no one character shines brighter than another and everyone has a cool moment that you talk about when the movie comes up; ""yeah that movie was awesome, remember when ______ did ______, that was so cool!""

The Avengers is the yardstick I use to measure all the following Marvel movies and to mind it's yet to beat.",9
"Apr 17, 2016","For the ones who doesn't care about the rise of the MCU, but at the end, The Avengers has a truly epic spirit and a talented cast that gets something to show to the audience, also bringing success to the MCU. There's no way this picture may follow the rules of its predecessors.",8
"Apr 17, 2016",Very good movie. Cannot go wrong that's for sure. I give it an 8 because the story simply is not as good as super hero movies like batman. The action is really good and the effects are awesome. Definitely worth seeing.,10
"Apr 11, 2016","Was such a great experience watching this film on opening night.

As a superhero film, this pretty much ticks all the boxes. Incredibly fun, action packed topped with great humour.

The cast was amazing with Tom Hiddleston getting a honourable mention as the primary antagonist, Loki. He was great in Thor, however in this film, he really took the spotlight. A great villain and a great reason to bring Earth's Mightiest Heroes together.

Every character played their part well, with Captain America and Iron Man being my favourite heroes. Ruffalo played a great Bruce Banner/Hulk and I'm excited to see him in future instalments.

The dialogue wasn't the greatest, however it suited the genre and tone of the film.

It was no masterpiece, however it was a lot of fun and exciting to see these heroes come together.

(Someone please fire the costume designer -- Captain Americas costume was even worse than his first outfit.. and that was designed in the 40's!)",8

"Mar 20, 2016","More overrated than Avatar!

Marvel Studios unveils its costliest special-effects demo to date; somewhere beneath the nonstop digital explosions lies a story about superheroes fighting an evil demigod from space. Every now and then, director Joss Whedon (Serenity) executes a quirky camera set-up to assert that the film was created by him and not a team of marketing executives. Of the star-studded cast, only Mark Ruffalo (playing Bruce Banner) and Robert Downey Jr. (as Iron Man) bring any personality to the place-holder dialogue. Overlong, monotonous, violent, and simple-minded, this is like one of those “World’s Biggest Gang Bang” videos, except that no one onscreen appears to be enjoying himself. With Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner.",4
"Mar 14, 2016","WHAT I LIKE: 'The Avengers' defines the comic book movie. It's explosive, fun, action packed, pop-corn entertainment taken to the next level. The feeling of seeing the characters you love, interact for the first time can never be repeated. The confrontations, the jokes, the teamwork, it all feels so real. How? Well, the acting is class A stuff, but Whedon's direction here is nothing short of amazing - it gives the movie heart. Really, it's a wonder it doesn't collapse under it's own weight. But but thanks to a mix of smart writing and exciting action it really, really doesn't; Whedon recognises the equal importance of some great scenes without all that fighting to ground the team dynamic and character relationships. So thankfully their dynamics are pegged perfectly, the tone of the humour and lightheartedness overall is well done, and the new characters are all great too. Oh, and that final action scene just makes it. Wow.
WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Some bits are a teeny bit cringe-worthy if I'm honest like the goofy costumes, cheesy lines and the odd bit of bad CGI. But it arguably adds to it's ballsy comic book charm.
VERDICT: It might not be flawless, but I haven't felt this way since Star Wars. It's monumental in how it makes you feel - proud, thrilled and downright happy.",9
"Mar 13, 2016","La película era la más esperaba luego de ver a sus protagonistas de forma individual, pero verlos juntos en una misma cinta, era algo que nunca se hizo jamás, me la vi, y simplemente era todo lo que esperaba de algo tan innovador, la disfruté muy bien de principio a fin, toda la trama se entralaza con las previas entregas de Marvel Studios y como los distintos personajes aprendían a trabajar en equipo para enfrentar a un mal masivo, la acción evoluciona mientras la película avanza, en la parte de la batalla final, me sentí como si volviera a tener 10 años, jamás una película me hizo sentir de esa manera, esta hizo a un lado las películas de los Transformers por mucho, en cuanto al elenco, todos han vuelto a hacer una buena interpretación de sus personajes y estos han progresado desde sus últimas apariciones, la Viuda Negra ha tenido más relevancia, se ha dado a conocer un poco de su historia, Mark Ruffalo como Bruce Banner y Hulk, le hace genial, supera por mucho a Edward Norton, no digo que Norton sea malo, pero Ruffalo hace un Banner casi parecido al que solía hacer el desaparecido Bill Bixby, aunque también me gustó con su álter ego verde, hasta el diseño de este es el mejor logrado y más realista de todos, hasta en la cara se parece a al de Ruffalo, me gustó que la historia de la peli estuviera basada en el número 1 de 1963 y The Ultimates, razón por que Loki vuelve a ser antagonista en esta película y lo hace bien y mejor, pero en mi caso no llega a quitarle protagonismo a los héroes, para terminar la película no me gustó, me encantó, tiene mucha acción en lo que dura la cinta, buena trama y todos los héroes tiene un protagonismo equilibrado, nadie opaca al otro, sin duda alguna se ha convertido en una de las mejores de Marvel, con un éxito tanto en crítica y público y la razón por qué ahora otros estudios de cine quieren hacer sus universos compartidos, pero nadie se va a comparar con Marvel que lo hizo primero con años de planeamiento y un gran elenco de actores que dan vida en esta franquicia, Joss Whedon ha conseguido dirigir y escribir una gran historia, la admiración de muchos por esta película que ha hecho historia en la cultura popular.",10
"Mar 6, 2016","It's a great superheroes movie with humor, many action and a very good acting. The story is good and The Avengers are a great team ! YOU MUST SEE THE MOVIE",10
"Feb 29, 2016","This movie deserves high praise for being the first of it's kind (for the most part). What other movie had 4 set-up films developing the main character's backstory for one major super-hero team-up to decide the fate of the fictional world. Of course this movie's action is epic in all the right places and each hero gets there time to shine (once again, for the most part). While I do have minor gripes such as Captain America's costume looking silly and corny (unlike the other films he appears in) and Hawkeye's role in the film, this movie still delivers on each and every promise it made. We get to see interesting conflict between the famous heroes and see them throw-down side by side in very well done action set-pieces. One particular sequence deserves high praise, in which it pans through all the heroes fighting the aliens which threaten the planet, starting from Black Widow to Hawkeye to Captain America and Iron-Man and finally the mighty tag-team of Hulk and Thor. With a satisfying climaxending and a great performing cast, ""Marvel's The Avengers"" is very close to a masterpiece that does the comics acceptable justice.",9

"Feb 8, 2016","I never really understood that hype and acclaim that came with The Avengers. It came out at the same time as The Dark Knight Rises and seemingly was thought by many to be the better movie, something I completely disagree with. The Avengers was entertaining but that was about it, this movie is clearly targeted for kids and young adults as the less than stellar pacing, clichéd dialogue and cookie cutter plot that I felt crippled the film in almost every way. I get that its a superhero movie, but that doesn't make up for how painfully sloppy this film was to me. While the action toward the end of the film and the awesome special effects make the movie at least somewhat watchable, its fair for me to say that as an impartial fan of both Marvel and DC that The Avengers was not nearly half the movie the TDKR was. 7/10",7
"Jan 28, 2016","Love it mostly becuse I love heros I love Tony Stark's funny puns, Steve Rogers seriosness, Bruce Banner's caution, Clint Barton's awesome arrows, Thor's accent, Natasha's badass moves and of cause Loki's sexiness and I love AC/DC",10

"Oct 22, 2015","This meeting of Marvel movie worlds makes for a satisfying and climactic battleground. The Avengers bursts with stunning combat visuals and memorable jokes while maintaining an enjoyable, suspenseful plot. Although one important actor has switched (Mark Ruffalo now as The Hulk) from the prequel films, Joss Whedon (director) still manages to pull off a beautiful, balanced infusion of the stars from each individual Avenger story. What ensues is the juxtaposition of modern urban warfare with cosmic weaponry and cosmic consequences. The Avengers is best watched after viewing Captain America and Iron Man (the other prequels are not up to standard). The Avengers is an iconic film for its revolutionary battle scenarios and its surprising humor.",9
"Oct 10, 2015","While it certainly has its flaws (such as the overly long climax), Avengers is still an epic finale to phase one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Loki is still awesome, and the quips are as frequent as ever (wether that's good or bad is up to you).",7
"Sep 29, 2015","Found this movie incredibly dull and childish, some parts were slightly amusing and the actors did a good job but overall I found it a unexceptional film.

"Jun 26, 2015",Seriously the best superhero movie ever? no way. It is very mediocre. Just a bunch of superheroes trying to one up each other while battling one of the least terrifying villains of all time.,3
"May 23, 2015","The best super hero movie of all time? Not in my opinion but it's still one of the best. This movie is the story of how the Avengers first unite and it's made with good acting, superb CGI, and insane fight scenes. Whether you care for Marvel or not, this movie is worth a watch. If you do, though, you've surely already seen it. I give it an 8.5/10. I enjoyed it a lot but not as much as some. I mean, it definitely isn't as good as The Dark Knight but it's still a very good movie.",8
"May 16, 2015","A film great, very funny and entertaining, with great fight scenes and special effects, a good story, just thought a negative point is the imbalance of the importance of the characters in the movie, I thought the Iron Man and the Hulk stood out far more than Captain America, Thor and the Black Widow. And has the Hawkeye that was one of the main characters less important, but ultimately the film is very good.",10
"May 13, 2015","This movie seemed like a reasonably good addition to the Marvel canon.  For full disclosure, I should comment that I was kind of confused for a lot of it, because I haven't seen any of the Thor movies, but I recognize that it's my fault I had trouble following.  The air ships and seeing more inside of Shield was great, especially because it meant more Samuel L. Jackson.  Loki is a really great villain which makes it fun to watch, although I knew I was missing a lot because I didn't know the back story about his relationship with Thor, except what I'd been told by my moviepartner.  Still, it seemed like he was a much more sympathetic enemy than a lot of the other comic book movies I've seen.  The scenes where all the Avengers are together tend to have a fun dynamic, just because of all the banter and disagreements between the characters.  The final climactic scene in New York is also really impressive; the creature-machines that came through the portal were really neat visually, although they seemed surprisingly easy to kill.",6
"May 11, 2015","The Avengers is a fun pop-corn movie. It is a pure entertainment and it is more than satisfying. The story might be a bit simple and lame, but you won't care at all.",10
"May 11, 2015",A very well done action movie that was explosive. One of the biggest box office hits of all time and I can see why. There's something in this movie for everyone great action and some good comedy elements in there as well. It did feel long at times and I do find that this film is over rated but it is still a very good watch,8
"May 4, 2015","Just saw the Avengers, after being recommended the Avengers: Age of Ultron and what a ride it was, an entertaining flick that innovates the idea of a movie universe where everything comes together. Joss Whedon outdoes himself in balancing out characters' screen time and legitimizing them in a balanced approach.",10
"May 3, 2015","I was afraid that not having seen any of the individual movies (yes, I am a tad ashamed) would pose a problem while watching 'The Avengers', but there really was no room for fear. 'The Avengers' were certainly a test for Marvel's Cinematic Universe, a test about whether they can pull such a movie (i.e. a blend of several before-released individual movies with an ensemble cast that acts as the main character, rather than each of the individual heroes themselves), and it did not go unnoticed. But, despite the visibly pulled brake, 'The Avengers' were exceptionally fun. The chemistry between the cast members (although I was sad not to see Ed Norton) was absolutely brilliant and they actually elevated their individual roles from the earlier movies to a completely new level. The plot was more-less consistent and not the least boring, and it actually all of the future installments quite nicely. Also, the puns were great, the humor in general, actually and you really did enjoy those funny moments and replicas between all that **** scenes. What I also liked is that 'The Avengers' never tried to simulate any depth; it was meant to be a fun action movie with all those lovable superheroes fighting together, being awesome and trashing stuff in order to crush the bad guys - and it was. They never tried to be something they weren't and they certainly did a brilliant job.

Whether you like comics or not, whether you like Marvel or not, whether you like the Avengers or not - this is a movie you should (not to say must) see as it will surely satisfy your needs.",8
"May 2, 2015","extremely overrated, but still enjoyable. The one thing I wish this movie has was a better villain. Loki is so stupid and boring he dragged this movie down.",6
"May 1, 2015","Superhero movies don't come any bigger than The Avengers. Joss Whedon delivers the must-see blockbuster for any serious Marvel Comcs fan. It offers enough memorable characters, sharp dialogue, spectacular special effects and impressive action to ensure multiple viewings.",9
"Apr 26, 2015",I enjoyed this movie all of the marvel movies connected to the series are entertaining. Like any other movie I felt it could have been alot better. Great cast of actors and following a great story make this movie and it does not deliver a disappointment.,7
"Apr 24, 2015",The movie was entertaining with great humour. Made me laugh a lot and good story line for the first avengers film. Wish if there where more characters in the team but its alright,9

Marvel Studios unveils its costliest special-effects demo to date; somewhere beneath the nonstop digital explosions lies a story about superheroes fighting an evil demigod from space.

Of the star-studded cast, only Mark Ruffalo (playing Bruce Banner) and Robert Downey Jr. (as Iron Man) bring any personality to the place-holder dialogue. Overlong, monotonous, violent, and simple-minded, this is like one of those “World’s Biggest Gang Bang” videos, except that no one onscreen appears to be enjoying himself. With Samuel L.

"Apr 13, 2015","aaaaaaaaah avengers it was so effing sick i almost vomited all over my lap but that was fine since i used that as lube to **** with. but the one thing that pissed me off during **** 4 was that scarlett johansen kept being in the centre of all the **** shots i coudlnt **** over the hulk properly. uuuhhhhhhh avengers avengers

i almost **** cried when they had the schwarma uuhhhhhh for £3 you can too if you live in liverpool at the schwarma cafe you will be just like the avengers, sorry uuuhhhhhhhh avengers. a **** **** you umayr",10
"Mar 18, 2015","After the heights and experiencing seeing 'Iron Man' (2008), 'Iron Man 2' (2010), 'Thor' (2011) and 'Captain America: The First Avenger' (2011), you can imagine how much I wanted to see this movie.

I was not disappointed, pretty much everything that was in this movie was pretty much all I expected to see and I'm happy with that.

'The Avengers' focuses on Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) trying to cope with Loki (Tom Hiddleston) taking the tesseract and using it against the world. Loki makes allies Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) his two new muses. Fury decides that it's time to assemble some of earth's mightiest superheroes, The Avengers.

We see Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) reluctantly join as he thought that he could not qualify. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) joins because he is a World War II veteran, so his inner self says that he has to save the world. We also see Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) not hiding anymore after his little incidents.

We also see agents Natasha Romonoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) return and convince each of the guys to try and stop Loki.

Obviously after the events in 'Thor' (2011), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) returns as he still has unfinished business with his brother Loki and what he plans to do with the tesseract.

This movie moves at such an entertaining pace and I have been waiting years to finally see it, four years to be specific, since the release of 'Iron Man' (2008), all I wanted to see is four Marvel heroes unite in their ultimate movie. Seeing this movie in the cinema back in 2012 was an absolute treat.

The action is pretty much similar to the ""Transformers"" movies, but they are cleaner and have purpose and style, unlike the ones in the ""Transformers"" franchise where it's just a technological mess and they were gimmicks.

Director Joss Whedon ('Buffy The Vampire Slayer' and 'Firefly') clearly respects the Marvel comics enough to make a coherent story and visually appealing action. I absolutely cannot wait for the anticipated 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' (2015), after seeing this, the Marvel universe is truly something amazing.",8
"Mar 11, 2015","The Avengers is easily one of the best films I've seen in the past few years. I saw it with my friends for the midnight premiere and it was a total blast from start to finish. Joss Whedon really pulled out all the stops when it came to directing a movie as big as this, and it shows. The entire ensemble cast was pitch-perfect, the action sequences were incredibly immersive and highly entertaining, and the dialogue was absolutely hilarious when it needed to be. I also loved the interactions between every one of the characters. Seeing them meet each other for the first time was both amazingly surreal and surprisingly realistic. Nearly everything from the score to the special effects to the comic timing just felt right. The Avengers is quite simply an experience that everyone should see. It just goes to show that Marvel is really stepping up their game, both commercially and creatively. Can't wait for the sequel!",9
"Mar 9, 2015","This movie was great! It was very well paced, comedic, and had a lot of action in it!  Each character was developed nicely and everyone did a great job in their roll.",9
"Jan 30, 2015","I'll admit it's cheesy, but The Avengers is also insanely enjoyable, exciting, and well acted. Everyone brings their A-game, and Joss Whedon masterfully creates the nerd film of the century.
Insane fun. 9/10",9
"Jan 22, 2015","The Avengers is not just bad, it's boring as hell. I simply don't get the appeal for these sorts of films. A 15 minute plot and 2 hours of mindless, mind numbing action is not exactly my idea of entertainment. Might as well go into the kitchen, bang a few utensils around and use my own imagination. It's certainly not art and it's not even fun.",1
"Jan 19, 2015",Marvel's The Avengers was one of the best movies of 2012. It's a great film to be part of The Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is Beyond Fantastic! Probably the best movie that Disney and Marvel has to offer!,10
"Jan 19, 2015","DISAPOINTING

For heroes like this to be in a movie, there should be more action with the hulk. As well as that there was a horrible plot behind the movie and it can bore you to death sometimes. This was truly horrible.",3
"Jan 4, 2015","It's hard to believe that Marvel brought all of these C-list superheroes together in one movie.. and it works!  This movie is a blast from start to finish.  Great acting, specifically Ruffalo, Hiddleston and Downey.  Great visuals and some great laughs where I laughed harder than at most comedies I've seen.",10
"Jan 4, 2015","By no 2nd close I think this is the best movie Marvel is yet to put out there. Even though I'm writing this review a couple years after the movies release I still think these things are true. Good acting, an OK dialogue and a lot of entertaining moments make for a GOOD movie. Notice how I didn't put great or just good, it was kind of in between.",7
"Jan 4, 2015","The avengers is probably Marvel's best movie. The effects were outstanding, the acting exceptional and the story line was humorous as well as serious. This movie would probably be better for comic book readers as they would have a sense of awe throughout the film, people who didn't really know about comics wouldn't understand all the terms and Easter eggs thus the experience wouldn't be so great.",8
"Dec 30, 2014","In the Avengers, all famous superheroes team up to save humans. The film has action, humor and a story but all of them are superficial and underdeveloped. The Avengers aims at catering all kind of audience (those who love superheroes, or actions, or comedies) but delivers a mixture that is none.

The idea of superheroes never settled well with me. The idea that we, people, are helpless and need superheroes to save and protect us is a troubling idea to say the best about it.

I really don't understand all the hype around this movie. 2 hours of your time is worth more than the laughter you get from seeing Hulk smashing Loki to the floor a few times (and that's the only good thing in the movie).",3
"Dec 21, 2014","Marvel 's Iconic superheroes assembles in one amazing **** Avengers is a great film in general with amazing heroes and fantastic actors portraying with awesome visual effects,Good story and great character **** Villain,Loki,is a great villain ,Tom Hiddleston did a great job portraying his **** Avengers is a great summer blockbuster!",9
"Dec 18, 2014",as much as it pains a fan who mostly prefers DC to Marvel I have to admit this is probably the greatest superhero movie ever made. it is very well acted and paced and has some of the best action sequences i've ever seen particularly the battle in new york the whole thing feels like a great event comic. this was well worth the build up here's hoping the sequel is just as good,10
"Dec 15, 2014","Literally the perfect and the best Marvel movie so far. It has awesome special effects, acting, and villians. Everyone you loved from Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and Hulk is in this movie. If you have not seen it, I highly recommend it.",10
"Dec 7, 2014",The avengers is a good movie which is action-packed and has a good storyline. The special effects used were awesome.This is a good movie to watch if you haven't seen this movie.,9
"Nov 23, 2014","The Avengers es una película en la que algunos momentos se torna fastidiosa, pero sin embargo ofrece unos grandes efectos visuales y da un buen espectáculo, por lo tanto tampoco hay que decir que la película es mala.",6
"Nov 17, 2014","The Avengers and the wrest of the Marvel cinematic universe could prove to be the Star Wars of it's generation. Joss Whedon clearly has a love and understanding of these characters and the source material. He collaborates all of these stars to perfection and balances their screen time effortlessly. His overall direction is solid and all of the set pieces are thoroughly enjoyable. The final act in particular is unbelievable and incredibly crowd pleasing. The whole cast is strong but Robert Downey Jr. is the standout as Iron Man. Tom Hiddleston is as equally superb as villain Loki, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow & Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury have much more involvement and most surprisingly Mark Ruffalo is a welcome recasting as the Hulk. Chris Evans & Chris Hemsworth are both strong also and have grown into their characters Captain America & Thor respectively. However my only minor criticism is Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye. Personally I didn't like the way his character was developed throughout the film until the final act. And I hope his character has the chance to shine in future releases. But otherwise as a lifelong fan of these characters I was both pleasantly surprised and incredibly satisfied. The Avengers caters for everybody, it's action packed, full of humour and it will please fan boys and newcomers alike. This is without a doubt Marvel's best film to date and it epitomises the success of the Phase 1 films. And even more excitingly it kick starts Phase 2 perfectly.",9
"Nov 16, 2014","A very fun movie, I absolutely recommend it. perfect special effects and a really well meda plot.
one of the best superhero movies there are. hope the next one doesnt disappoint",10
"Nov 16, 2014","Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) Analysis: Marvel's The Avengers (2012)

So now it's time for The Avengers. But before we get to that, I got a few things to say. Ever since the beginning of this MCU ""marathon"", I've been planning to see other franchises. As I am a super-hero fanatic, I marked in my agenda and calendar franchises such as: X-Men, Spider-Man and Batman. Every movie of that franchise is going to be seen by me every Saturday, and when I'm not seeing those movies in Saturday, I'm going to see films that were released in 2014 that I haven't seen it. Which is the case here. I rewatched The Avengers yesterday (as I'm writing this on 9th November of 2014) and next Saturday, I'm going to see the video game adaption ""Need for Speed"". And then in the next Saturday after that, it's the Phase 2 of MCU. All these things I'm organizing is merely a way to be entertained when I have nothing else to do and it's going to last until next October of 2015. After seeing a movie, I'm going to write a review and post it on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic as ""Diogo Mendes"". If you're seeing this right now, you'll know what I am talking about. Now that I've cleared up that, it's time to talk about the best Marvel movie to date. ""The Avengers"", my friends, is one of the best Marvel outputs since Spider-Man 2. It not only raises the bar for Marvel at their films, but it also makes their heroes look even cooler than they already are. It's excting, it's funny, it's packed with action and heart and the movie clearly understands that super-heroes have a human side.

S.H.I.E.L.D. has located the mysterious Tesseract device and the Army's super soldier Captain America. The Tesseract is actually a gateway to an entirely new world called Asgard. A mysterious being known as Loki arrives on earth and immediately assumes that he can rule all human beings. But that irks S.H.I.E.L.D. directory Nick Fury the wrong way. As Loki escapes with the Tesseract, Nick Fury believes this is an act of war against Earth. His only hope is to assemble an actual team of super heroes. Dr. Bruce Banner, who turns into an enormous green rage monster known as the Hulk. Tony Stark and his venerable Iron Man armor. Captain America, the Stark Enterprises created super soldier. Thor, the god of thunder, protector of Earth and his home planet of Asgard, and Loki's brother. Master assassins Hawkeye and Natasha Romanoff. Together they will become a team to take on an attack that will call them to become the greatest of all time.

Ok, let's be honest right here. We all know that there wasn't any doubt that this movie would succeed. Not because it has Joss Whedon as the director and writer, but because having iconic, interesting super-heroes teaming up to defeat a larger threat is something we haven't seen it before, and Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America, all these characters teaming up is really fun to see. The way that the movie focuses on these MARVELOUS characters is just extraordinary, and the character development... holy ****, the character development. The movie offers so much information about these super-heroes without feeling like an exposition. And the action... oh my god. I need to tell you that there's one part where the camera moves onto each Avenger fighting with the Chitauri, in ONE SINGLE SHOT. I'm not even kidding, if you see the movie, you'll be astonished. The final battle... is amazing. Don't get me wrong, the other elements of the movie are so great, really, really great, but the final battle... my god. 15 minutes of firefights, punches, emotion and nerdgasm. It doesn't reach the level of awesomeness of the train sequence in ""Spider-Man 2"" but this scene is so goddamn spectacular. The visual effects and the colors are startling. The one character that was used full CGI was, of course, The Hulk. Remember when I said that the Hulk from the 2008's film looked kind of cartoonish? Well, in this movie, he looks just what he should look like. And this classic character kicks so much ass in this movie, breaks everything in his sight. But you also can see that there's a heart in the character.

The characters are fully fleshed out and intriguing. Hell, even the Galaga guy is awesome, AND he's not even a character! Every character share their spotlight, delivering fun dialogue, essential information about their past. The villain is not as powerful as The Joker in ""The Dark Knight"", but Loki is so manipulative. You don't really know what's going on his head. And Thanos... oh my god. I'll admit. I didn't know anything about the character, I'm not a comic book kind of guy, but I enjoy reading some of them, especially when it's Spider-Man or Batman related. Thanos was a major character in The Infinity Gauntlet storyline back in the 90's. He was menacing and he was always grinning. I heard that they're following those series, but I'm wondering how they are going to follow those stories. Some of the characters belong to different studios. Very complicated. But getting back to Thanos, he's only in a mid-credits scene, so don't expect too much of him in this movie.

So I talked about the story, the big action set-pieces and the interesting characters, but something is missing... oh yeah, the cast! Robert Downey Jr, Mark Ruffalo, Nick Fury and all the others are so talented. Maybe that's why the characters work. It's because the well-chosen cast seems to have an understanding of what the characters are. Tony Stark is pretty much what we've got in both Iron Man films: Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. Steve Rogers is the lonely super-soldier, Bruce Banner is the angry man in his fight against his ""disease"" and Thor is the mighty god of Asgard, arrogant and stupid. All of them seem to understand their characters, that's why this movie is so likable. Not only the script offers a look at his heroes' humanity, but it also offers proper development. The soundtrack is also very exciting. And when I mean exciting... I really mean exciting. So when your movie has everything that you want, it instantly becomes your favorite movie, and although ""Marvel's The Avengers"" is definitely not the best movie ever made, it is the best super-hero movie to date. Why? Because it's a classic very well done! Even if the movie didn't have the best script ever, it would still be very good. Why? Because the whole concept works! This concept about heroes teaming up WORKS! And I am not even a fanboy.

Final Score to The Avengers: A solid 10/10. Literally, everything works here. The script is sharp, the action is pretty much top-notch, the characters are captivating and witty, the soundtrack is electrifying, the production values are high and the universe's atmosphere is becoming increasingly higher with Marvel now introducing new characters. You don't need awesome characters like Spider-Man or Wolverine to prove that this is the best Marvel movie to date. Marvel is on the roll and this nearly masterpiece proves that. Please, if you haven't seen this movie, go see it. I recommend it for every age. I also would like to point out that this movie clearly affected DC Comics in a big and dramatic way. In such way that they are rushing their famous characters and throwing years of mythology away. Now they're making a Batman Vs Superman movie to attract the audience and generate more and more money to their cash cow. I'm still going to see, and despite knowing that Chris Terrio is writing the story, I know I'm going to be disappointed. Unfortunately. Next review: Need for Speed (2014)",10
"Nov 12, 2014","The best superhero movie made to date.  Marvel did an amazing job bringing it all together from the writing, directing, casting, acting, action, and special effects.  Robert Downey, Jr. was BORN to play Ironman/Tony Stark, Hemsworth is a great Thor, Scarlett is the perfect Black Widow, and Ruffalo might be the best Banner to date.  Not a ""thinking man's"" movie, but a TON of fun to just sit back and watch.  Very well done.",10

Pensé que no estaría mal juntar a tantos superhéroes pero el resultado fue una película con una primera hora llena de diálogos vacíos y chistes tontos (que alguien le pegue un tiro ya a thor y hulk, pensaba yo) y una segunda hora de acción que solo demuestra que lo único bueno de la peli son sus efectos. ¿En serio os gusta esto?
Películas para niños pequeños... Marvel las ha hecho mejores. Desastrosa.",3
"Aug 5, 2014","Great special effects and action, weak plot and the use of an already estabelished villian.  Also at about the one hour mark the film slows down to a crawl so it can get everyone together and bicker.  As strong as Tom Hildeston is as Loki, i was kind of disappointed to see him as the primary villian for half the movie.  There is a huge amount of Avengers villiany through out the comics that could have been tapped into, but Whedon chose to go in the driection of generic space creatures instead.  The movie does make good use of humor and its probably the most accessible marvel movie yet.",7
"Aug 3, 2014","Probably the most fun you will ever have watching a film, The Avengers is one on the list along with The Dark Knight as one of the best superhero movies out there. The film's characters are absolutely great, the action is amazing, and the film has enough humor to have you laugh more than a few times. The only downside is that the story isn't too much and isn't very memorable. Besides that, the films grabs your favorite superheroes to make one of the best action movies you will ever see.",9

"Jul 30, 2014","The Avengers is an fantastic movie with great amount action and a wonderful story, and I'm especially amazed by the music and the special effects!

Another thing that's great about The Avengers is the opening scene, which truly is exiting and thrilling. I found this movie highly entertaining, because it's so damn good and unique, and it's packed with great actors and the movie overall is cool and touching. The negative thing about The Avengers is that the tempo is a little to slow at some places, but also that there are some scenes that's not so original, because some scenes looks like they might have taken from other movies (like Transformers). But except for that is The Avengers truly fascinating!

An amazing film from Marvel, but with to much slow scenes (and boring conversations).

The Avengers gets a 8.7/10",8
"Jul 8, 2014","הסרט הכי יפה של במארוול יוניברס עד כה, סרט ממש מהנה ומבדר כדאי לראות. במיוחד למי שאוהב  סרטי גיבורי על ימות על הסרט הזה. אבל חבל שהוא לא יותר מסרט קיץ כיפי",10
"Jun 3, 2014","Directed by Joss Whedon, Marvel’s The Avengers is an action-packed movie.  Although the back stories for each superhero are lengthy and make it hard-to-follow at times for those not well-versed with the classic Marvel comics, the plot line is entertaining and draws the viewer in, as if they are fighting alongside the heroes.
The story begins with the Tesseract, a cube that provides energy that could be the energy source to power everything, being stolen from the S.H.I.E.L.D. agency, lead by Nick Fury, by Loki, Thor’s evil stepbrother.  While the Tesseract is being stolen, Loki turns Hawkeye and the doctor into his “evil minions”.  Desperate times call for desperate measures and Fury calls out to Iron Man, Hulk, Black Widow and Captain America.  Thor joins later after trying to get Loki to give back the Tesseract on his own means.  This combination of heroes leads to a lot of personality clashes and egotistical fighting.  Will they defeat Loki and get back the Tesseract or will they continue to fight over trivial differences and allow the world to be destroyed?
This movie has literary value and has a positive impact.  Based on the comics, it brings superheroes back to the forefront since comics are not as popular as they once were.  The elaborate character development throughout the comics and other movies makes the superheroes and villains dynamic and intriguing characters.  They may be “super”, but they are more similar to “regular” people than is blatant.  How can a person dislike a hero like Captain America who is a super soldier designed to give him a second chance and a future? Or the Hulk who tried to save someone else and got the full blast of radiation, which makes it impossible for him to hide the anger everyone keeps inside?
Themes and motifs explode from the movie like the powerful blasts of the Tesseract itself.  There is always the cliché good vs. evil struggle that all superhero movies showcase.  The interesting combination of powerful personalities in the movie shows how people can put aside their differences and unite for a common goal, regardless of how big the differences may seem.  Lastly, the motif of which superheroes are superior is present amidst the arguments.  Some argue that superheroes like Thor who were “born that way” are the best, while the idea that anyone can be a superhero (like Iron Man who used his money and intelligence to make a super suit) are more inspiring.  Then there are experimental superheroes like Captain America and “mistakes” like the Hulk (or Spider-man who is not in this movie).
Overall, the movie is not my personal favorite, mostly because I was raised playing with Barbie’s instead of action figures so my lack of understanding got in the way of enjoying the movie.  However, the movie is still very great for what it is, which is why I will give it an eight out of 10 rating.",8
"Jun 1, 2014","The Avengers is directed by Joss Whedon. It is about many Marvel comic superheroes having to join forces to fight against evil. Thor, Captain America, Hulk, Iron Man, Hawkeye, and Black Widow must work together to fight against Thor’s adopted brother, Loki, and his army. Thor affects the story by having sympathy towards Loki. No one could just kill Loki because of his relationship with Thor. Captain America always wanted to have a plan of what to do. He is “old-school” compared to the other heroes, but changes the story by coming up with plans that were best for his team. The Hulk is the “muscle” out of the group. He helped teach the other heroes the art of self-control which affected what the others did in the film. Iron man was the most confident out of the group. His confidence played mind games with Loki, which poked holes into his evil plan. Hawkeye came later in the movie after being possessed by Loki and made part of his army. After being saved, Hawkeye wanted revenge against Loki for possessing him, which made Hawkeye more focused and accurate in battle. It changed the film by adding another member to the Avenger team to help defeat Loki’s army. Black Widow is an elite trained, Russian spy. She affected the movie by adding a female to the team, which made it more interesting and diverse. Thor’s adopted, younger brother, Loki, is the reason the superheroes must join forces. Loki’s character creates the plot for the story to take place.
One of the themes for this work is that teamwork is harder than it appears. All these characters have their separate lives, towns, and villains to fight. They’ve single handedly defeated their opponents and have been praised for it. They have never had to work together with someone as equally powerful as themselves to defeat evil. Bringing independent personalities together makes this theme effective. Their independence makes it harder for them to work together. The team must learn to acknowledge their individual skills and compromise with each other throughout the film to be successful. This main idea is different and groundbreaking. Bringing together superheroes from separate stories and combining them into one unstoppable team is mind blowing. It changes all their stories to impact where they can know each other, and maybe even appear in each other’s separate movies. It creates a bridge between all of them and their lives.
Some amusing quotes that stood out to me were:
Captain America: “Hulk… smash.” Captain America said this when directing everyone on what to do and where to go. Captain American believed in having a plan and also using what skills you have to offer. This is my favorite quote because the Hulk always screams it in his other movies and it made me laugh.
Loki: “I have an Army!”
Iron Man: “We have a Hulk.” Iron Man was trying to be witty and play with Loki’s mind. This quote showed that Iron Man admired the Hulk’s strength and displayed his confidence in his team and its members.
The film appealed to me in an emotional way, because it made me root for the good guys to win and defeat evil to save the world once again. The team uses all their powers to save the world threatened by Loki.
The movie is rated a 9 because it was action-packed with the characters displaying many different personalities. The good guys win in the end, but the plot was slow in some parts of the story.",9
"May 24, 2014","First time watching the Avengers i was amazed, astonished and dazzled by the fact that Marvel manged to create an avengers film; Second time watching through the film, again im amazed at how good the film is and how much better it is compared to over superhero films; Third time, its an ok film, the acting is good, the action is good, but i feel as if something is missing; FOURTH **** TIME, what the **** what is the plot of the film, why is the main story so boring, damn why is captain america under used, why are all the characters very shallow and boring, why is the only good thing about the film the fact that the Action sequences are spectacular and seeing all those hero's on the screen amazing.

I rest my case, The Avengers is a above average film that managed to trick people in to thinking that it was Awesometacular.",5
"May 4, 2014","The Avengers: 6/10 ""Correcta""

Una buena película que tiene como principal virtud juntar a varios superhéroes de Marvel con éxito,pero no tiene una buena historia y por momentos se siente muy monótona.",5
"May 4, 2014","Overhyped but a fun ride none the less. it is fantastic to get to see all these heroes together on the big screen. However even with the super lame villain Loki, the avengers never crosses to lame.",7
"Apr 19, 2014","I'll be the fist to admit that the plot was a little weak BUT! This is a fanboys wet dream. What I've been waiting years to witness! As a proud Marvel comics nerd, I never had any doubt in my mind about this one. Ever since Marvel Studios began it's journey making films in house, which started with Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, it has been nothing but great. The room for creative writing and directing is limitless.  Mark Ruffalo delivers the best portrayal of Bruce Banner/ Hulk on film, PERIOD! The balanced screen time each of these crucial characters receives is flawlessly pulled off by Joss Whedon! What Marvel Studios has done with the cinematic universe has forever changed the course of film and has raised the bar pretty dang high.  (Take note, Fox and WB/DC) There are enough laughs, action and emotional moments that will satisfy the casual moviegoers and fanboys alike.",8
"Mar 24, 2014","I think the optimal film does not know why not won any Oscars worthy because it had History, cast, special effect of exellent quality, although not so the best thing to have your movie special effect I thought it was good because you make a film heroine and not will place special effect, I think they put emseu comedy film, and mixed with action.",10
"Mar 8, 2014","The problem I see in this movie was the theme, which is not very well designed, and were supposed to be more. It has lots of action and stunning visuals, but only enough, in my opinion, this 6.",6
"Mar 4, 2014","A rather simple plot is elevated greatly by slick, stylish and witty dialogue and script. It's also worth noting that Whedon in a few scenes cleverly avoids contrivance, which seems to be a staple and almost a cliche nowadays for superhero movies. Overall, this films lives up to its hype and it's definitely up there for one of my favourite action movies.",8
"Feb 24, 2014",Great fun! Mark Ruffalo as Hulk totally owns Eric Bana's poor performance and also surpassess Norton's Hulk. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow... oh dead God that leather suit.. I don't need to talk about it no more.. Just watch this movie if you want a great popcorn flick.,7
"Feb 16, 2014","Since this genre is never my first choice, I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked and enjoyed ""The Avengers"". The film didn't aim for anything deep and ambiguous, it was just pure fun and enjoyment; a great blockbuster movie and a great superhero movie. The choreography in the action scenes was well stylized, cinematography was nice and clean, and the humor was witty and actually humorous. I would recommend it to both Marvel fans and other people.",8
"Feb 13, 2014",The Avengers is possibly the single greatest movie I have ever seen. It kept me on the edge of my seat nearly the entire movie! The Avengers tied up every prequel that came before it which I really liked. I bought the movie for Blu-Ray and watch it nearly every time I get the chance to. The Avengers keeps me wrapped up in the mysteries and funny moments.,10
"Feb 3, 2014","Perfect example of an overrated movie. The saying ""Less is more"" applies here. There are too many super heroes in this film and none of them are used appropriately. The movie is also much longer than it needs to be. It never seems to end and for most of it, it is boring and forgettable. By the time the real action begins, you're already more than 3/4s into the film. This is a dumb stupid popcorn movie featuring a dumb stupid team of superheroes. Ironman on his own or Hulk on his own are great but throw them in with goody two shoes Captain America whose character is flat, boring and lifeless or Mr. Bulging Biceps Thor who isn't a super hero at all (He's a mythical God. Next time, the Avengers should recruit Zeus or Jesus Christ) and is the beefed up equivalent of Brandan Frasier's boy in a bunker and its just gets sloshed around into a muddled mess.",1
"Feb 1, 2014","Mala muy sobre valorada, Joss Whedon puede ser bue guionista pero como director deja mucho que desear, la película es decepcionante y todos parecen niños desesperados por esta película. Una historia muy simple.",0
"Jan 15, 2014","Whoa, this movie is unquestionably a ""Must Watch"" for all Marvelites around the globe. This film features a unique combination of Iron Man, Captain America, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Thor, Hulk and one of the most loved and awesome villains, Loki! Joss Whedon should be the face of Marvel! I'd love it if the Avengers 2 included Spider-Man!",10
"Jan 11, 2014","Cool, funny, beautiful and interesting. Director Joss Whedon managed to completely different characters to combine them into one command so that each would not take over the movie.

The Avengers 2012 blockbuster best and best movie Marvel comics. Stark Tony / Iron Man excellent jokes. Loki turned out very cool villain. The other characters are also good. In the film, excellent special effects, cool action, a great cast and funny jokes.",9
"Jan 6, 2014","Well let's everybody enjoy ourselves with a quality superhero flick that is... In its first multiple superhero team-up, executed nearly flawlessly. Consider the many opportunities that this movie had a chance to create gaping plot holes, only to be masterfully minimized by Whedon and his team.",10
"Jan 3, 2014","this film just works. each marvel hero is woven into the story seamlessly, and the script sparkles with their interplay. it is essentially a classic comic book movie so the story doesn't really hold up, but hell, it's damn entertaining and has some very funny moments.",8
"Dec 30, 2013","If Marvel had made several unconnected movies of various superheroes, it would have been sufficient. By making them all part of one massive universe- and capping it off with this studio masterpiece- they created a legend. I loved The Avengers because it didn't try to be anything more than what it was: a pulse-pounding thrill ride complete with epic action sequences, solid acting, vibrant special effects, and a whole lot of gut-busting humor. A prime example of entertainment at its highest level.",10
"Dec 30, 2013","The action is extremely well done, and fortunately there are a couple of interesting characters on screen (Tony Stark [Ironman], Steve Rogers [Cpt. America]) to provide a bit more. Otherwise, we're talking about a completely cartoony plot, with one dimensional (at best) characters (how hard was it to make *Loki* interesting?!), and junior-high grade dialog.",7
"Dec 22, 2013","Special effects, explosions, men and women in tight clothing, building on the franchise. It's your average superhero movie, what can I say.  I'm biased, for sure, I don't mind Marvel's movieverse(s) and have grown attached to their cinematic versions of the heroes I had originally been introduced to through the comics. If you're either an avid and loyal fan of the original comic books or not much of a Marvel fan at all, it's probably a movie you can go without watching. Knowing more about the characters beforehand definitely adds sentimental appeal and perhaps provides more entertainment; it's a hunk of fanboy/girl material and clever marketing.",5
"Dec 21, 2013",Why all the hate  it's a fun movie to watch  featuring some of the hottest stars alive  it actually gets better with each time viewing and I'm NOT a fan of comics,7
"Dec 17, 2013","A fun ride. Favorite parts were the physics ideas in action scenes. Least favorite part was the lack of focus, how everything just kept moving on so fast you never really got to reflect about anything. Also, the setup with the energy source that is also super dangerous reminded me of The Dark Knight Rises and I had overall seen a lot of the ideas before. The movie could have established sympathy with the heroes or with civilians, instead it asks you to automatically feel for humanity or New York or whatever. I honestly didn't, so it never crossed over into an emotionally engaged territory. But yeah, it's fun I guess.",6
"Dec 16, 2013","The Avengers is definitely one extremely fun movie.  It doesn't transcend the genre's storytelling limits like Nolan's Batman trilogy did, but the whole thing probably would have collapsed trying to do this anyways.  Instead it smartly embraces the lunacy of comic books rather than try to reject it.  This means that the film becomes a little to silly at times, but it also allows it to be built from the ground up as a gigantic showcase for an array of very exciting action set pieces.  It's definitely not a very deep or thought provoking film, but it's elevated well above the average explosion fest by its style, sense of fun, more than solid visual effects, and well established, albeit somewhat cartoony and overly flamboyant, characters.  It's one of the most entertaining superhero movies out there.",8
"Dec 15, 2013","Una cagada, aburrida por momentos, las peleas son flojas, sin EPICA sin EMOCIÓN una mierda en general. Fue muy sobre valorada. La gente es ciega, salí del cine re decepcionado.",0
"Dec 13, 2013","It has to be pretty hard to do a movie with all these super heroes together and not do a horrible movie. So if only because it´s not a disaster by any means I give it a pass with a score of 5 out of 10. Apart from that the movie is not impacting or emotional or emotive or anything. It just keep you entertained while it lasts. But you quickly forget about it the moment it is over. Not impressive at all. Batman or Spiderman movies have so much more emotional content and lasting impact, just to give two examples. The thing that should be unquestionable is the great visual effects, but even that becomes not that impressive only a year later, when we had in 2013 several blockbusters doing it better and bigger, especially Star Trek into Darkness and Man of Steel (the most epic action in a super hero movie to date). Not even the score is especially good or something like in Nolan´s Batman or Man of Steel cases. Really forgettable no matter how much money it did thanks to the normal publicity generated by putting all these super heros together.",5
"Dec 13, 2013",I can't find a single reason to give this movie a 9.This is perfect film certainly the best movie of the year for **** characters are great and the last battle true epicness that you can't get **** culture is much richer and glorius with this movie at our hands.,10
"Dec 10, 2013","Decepcionante, es una adaptación bastante fría, sin emoción no eh visto nada EPICO en esta película, su tono infantil la caga un poco. La expectativa fue mucha y termino siendo una decepción total.",0
"Dec 8, 2013","A get together of superheroes should have been set more entertainingly. When you don't have a story good enough, even a lot of superheroes fail to keep you hooked. The Aviator might have sounded exciting on paper, but what I watched was a let-down. I take consolation in knowing that it worked out for the majority of its audience (purely going by the ratings shown here). Can't wait for the sequel!!! With all due respect, 1/5 sounds fair enough for the experience. Miss the good old days wherein I can picture myself enjoying this sort of movie.",0
"Dec 7, 2013","I had never thought that I would see this kind of movie-franchise team up, and I have to congratulate Marvel for doing something that is now being copied by Sony and Fox (with their Spiderman and X-Men franchises). I mean; Iron Man, the Hulk, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye teaming up to fight aliens? What? Unfortunately, the first 45 minutes are kinda boring. The car chase in the beginning is boring. I personally think it's overrated. I liked Loki, but he and his army seem pretty weak. I just didn't enjoy this movie. HowevervI like the action.

Overall, I expected much better from Marvel.

"Nov 6, 2013","The Nuclear Bomb Of Awesomeness & Excitement
**The Avengers**

* If this movie fails to bring you the Awesomeness & Wonderful Excitement Then you wont get those things in any movies which you see in future   The Avengers the movie which stood as pinnacle for delivering such Awesomeness & Excitement which you would never have expected   Basically the movie consist of major MARVEL characters such as Iron Man,Hulk & Thor with each characters having movie of their own in different **** this movie they are all brought back together without changing any of their contents from their origin movies.These movies which has been a building blocks for the development of the avengers   Packing these huge movies putting their contents into one package would surely create a mess to handle such complicated task of displaying multiple attributes of different films and their characters is not an easy task to be handled with But Director And Screen play writer Joss Whedon has done an amazing & fantastic job of handling those issues and developing these characters to a new level not only that but developed their attributes to a new level as well its shows how talented and skillful joss whedon really is   The screen play is fantastic in this movie every characters interaction with one another is spectacular its show how well the script has been **** this movie most important thing is that every major characters have enough screen time to play and its brilliant considering the characters importance in this film   All actors in this movie has given their amazing performance each and every actors in this movie needs to be applauded for their performance they were all simple,humors & displayed their acting with such elegance which you cannot find any fault!.  In category of action its """"SPECTACULAR""""every fighting scene in this movie is worth watching many times its very awesome seeing your heroes fighting in big screen .Action sequence in this film is simply ""AMAZING"".

Overall this movie will make you filled with Excitement and Awesomeness to the end .Simply to put in one word its ""EPIC"".."" A Must Watch Movie ""!.

THE AVENGERS **********

(10/10) Stars",10
"Nov 4, 2013","I have been waiting a long time to see this movie. And I'm going to start off by saying that ""The Avengers"" is incredible. The action scenes are spectacularly exciting, with excellent use of visuals and CGI. One of my favorite scenes was when the camera spins around the superheroes because that was epic. This could well be one of the best summer blockbusters ever made.",9
"Oct 19, 2013","avengers is a good superhero movie that entertains enough, marvel managed to make several characters become the center of the story, it deserves to be seen.",9
"Oct 19, 2013","I hate how marvel shows their heroes today, very violent and taking so many lives. they are too brutal and it's hard to view them as heroes especially when a huge part of marvel's fan base are children. They are viewed as gods and its ridiculous that they just take a life at will. Another thing that I hate is marvel is just being a copycat with this movie. With Loki purposely getting captured like the joker in the dark knight then destroying the air base from within just like how joker destroyed the police station. Another thing is the whole destroy the mothership and kill the whole army this is copied from Battle L.A. And Star Wars the phantom menace. Marvel is just a mediocre copycat company. They should be more original with the wonderful characters that they have.",0
"Oct 6, 2013","I had been waiting to watch this movie, as it looked cool enough. I mean; Iron Man, the Hulk, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye teaming up to fight aliens? Awesome! Unfortunately, the first 45 minutes are kinda boring. I mean what good superhero movie starts with a pretty boring car chase and bland dialogue/scripts? I personally think it's pretty overrated. Cliched, predictable and shallow. I liked Loki though and liked the superheros fighting aliens.

However, there's also a lot of mistakes with the plot. For example, while Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America are fighting, they leave Loki, their supervillain prisoner unattended. Also, SHIELD's entire Heli-Carrier is almost destroyed by one freaking arrow. All of The Avengers talk and pretend to have ear pieces even though they don't have any. Also, the Chitauri are nothing like they are in the comics. (And there's that annoying bickering between characters...) Overall, I expected much better from Marvel.

"Sep 21, 2013","The Avengers is a solid effort to combine some very powerful heroes into a single storyline. There are some elements that aren't perfect, including an unusually irritating Tony Stark. Loki chews the scenery and lights up every scene he's in.",8
"Sep 20, 2013","For the most part, the Avengers was solid, and it kept me entertained; which is the sole purpose, right? The star-studded cast was all there, ready to make a great action movie. Some parts even made me laugh, more than I expected. I like Colbie Smulders, who played Agent Maria Hill, since she plays Robin on How I Met Your Mother. But, I think we all have to admit, she didn't only get the part for her amazing acting talents. We all know she 's pretty.",8
"Sep 20, 2013","""The Avengers"" was probably one of the most exhilarating movies I have ever watched. It creative mix of characters and its unstoppable action is as epic as it can be. The only slight downside of it is its relatively simple plot, but it is an action movie, and it's large budget is mostly for enhancing that. I am pretty sure that the sequel scheduled for 2015 is a movie that I will watch.",9
"Aug 24, 2013","Enough action to go with the plot, which is remarkably sensible and it's pacing get's to the main point quickly. The depth of each characters personalities (especially those of Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr.) interrelate to create this energetic tone to the film. It's and eye popping extravaganza.",8
"Aug 23, 2013","The Avengers  at first  dissapointed me, but it grew on me. The film gradually builds up from being boring and full of emotionless events and non-exciting action to an extremely exciting climax, the middle of the film was suspence filled build up to the climax near the end. The near-end climax of the story and action did not dissapoint me, as it was one of the most exciting group of scenes in all movies. The acting and character building was great in this film; although the story wasn't the best, it was pretty darn good and certainly kept me watching  but the story wasn't the only thing keeping me watching... The action was non-stop and incredibly exciting throughout the last 50 minutes, it made me smile to see all of the characters work together to save the citizens of New York  and, well, the world.
Although The Avengers starts blandly and boringly, it gradually builds up to an incredibly exciting climax; The Avengers may not be the best super hero film I've seen, but it's still very good and definetely deserves to be watched around the world. So I give this film a... 87/100!",9
"Aug 22, 2013","Man, where to begin...this is one of my favorite movies of the last 12 years. This movie exceeded my expectations. The cast could not have been picked better. RDJ did a phenomenal job as Tony Stark as he always does, Chris Evans redeemed himself from the Fantastic Four with Captain America and came back with a vengeance here. Chris Hemsworth, well done. Jeremy Renner, didn't know him until this movie. Damn. And what can I say about Mark Ruffalo? Best damn Bruce Banner portrayal since Lou Ferigno. WELL done! The plot was fluid, it made sense, it was engaging, gripping and didn't lose my attention at all. The fact that they connected every movie before it together to make this: Iron Man 1 and 2, Thor, Captain America and The Incredible Hulk. Amazing idea and it worked perfectly. This is as close to a perfect Marvel action film as there can be.",10
"Aug 8, 2013","I walked into the theater expecting something great and I couldn't wait to finally see what everyone was raving about. I was disappointed. Though the action scenes were exciting and the character played by Tom Hiddleson was pleasing, the dialogue throughout the movie was terrible and forced. It seemed like the scenes that wasn't accompanied by fighting was boring and uneventful. This movie had a great story line and plot but failed to be put together correctly.",5
"Aug 6, 2013","Incredibly cliched, predictable and shallow.
- No tension or suspense.
- Cheesy one liners.
- Not a shred of seriousness or genuine emotion.

- Repetitive, linear, predictable, and ridiculous plot that features Loki repeatedly escaping from the       avengers.
- Bits of humor.
- Good performance from Robert Downey Jr.
- Good action and special effects.

Could be one of the most overrated movies of all-time!  The second time that I watched it, I fell asleep about an hour into it.  It's not a horrible movie, but it's definitely NOT a perfect 10/10.  The first Ironman and Captain America were much more logical and had more dimensions to their plots.

However, the Avengers takes all of these traits and amps them up. The actions is bigger and better, there are more protagonists, leading to better and funnier dialogue, and the movie is a lot more fun as a result. You'll definitely have a good time watching the Avengers. It's not a revolutionary movie, but it doesn't have to be. It's just a fun action movie that never slows down.",7

"Jun 16, 2013","While it is a good attempt, The Avengers fails at the true essence of the superhero genre. The avengers has amazing acting yes, however they cannot help interest me in the more dramatic scenes, which are extremely slow paced and boring. Though Hulk's character was well explored, Hawkeye's character wasn't explored much and I was never interested in him. Action sequences are a pain to watch because of the poor cinematography. It just looks like the cameras are whizzing around everywhere and is an eyesore. Story is not that great either. In superhero movies, Story is worth at leas 45% of the entire movie. The story was not explained well and I couldn't care less about it. This could have been a great movie but missed a great chance of becoming one.",6
"Jun 16, 2013","In the decade it's taken to bring everything together, we've continually been promised that the Avengers would be the superhero movie to change all superhero movies and it's a damn good thing, because I really hate superhero movies. Three things made this film standout and shine over the many, many superhero films that have been released. The most obvious thing is the huge, superstar, cast. Not only is it incredibly difficult to bring a cast like this together, but to get them to work together, without getting in each others way must have been nearly impossible. Second, even though the film involves superheroes and outer space, it seems somewhat realistic to us. These heroes have families, personalities, feelings, people get hurt, and some people even die, letting us see the human side of these characters. Finally, the Direction of Joss Whedon brings it all together. Whedon has always had this unique ability to put his own style on spin on things, at first it seems strange, but ultimately we come to love it. He is such an underrated Director, who brings so much to everything he's a part of, and it's great to see him get to do a huge project like this. The Avengers was special, not only because it took a decade to make, but because if you saw all the individual movies first, like I did, you feel a connection to these guys, it's almost like you know them personally and you expect them to act in certain ways when they all come together. The individual films really built up the excitement and helped the Avengers to become a billion dollar earner at the box office. From the performances to the special effects this was once exciting, terrific movie, and may be as close to perfect as a superhero movie will ever get.",10
"Jun 9, 2013","The best superhero movie of all time. This movie is so amazing, bringing the superheroes together and forming the avengers was the perfect idea for marvel. Loki played a great villain in this movie and it was a lot of action and pretty hilarious. This movie had so much action that it was hard to take your eyes of the screen for just a second. Iron man was the most exciting thing about this movie to me. This is definitely one of my favorite movies and if you watch the extra ending of the movie it gives you a clue that Thanos will be in the next movie. Watching this movie tells you that the guardians of the galaxy will be very good.",9
"Jun 6, 2013","The story is based more on action than plot.  That said, I wouldn't say the plot is bad, it's just not particularly strong.  It overcomes that with great action sequences, passable acting (great in the cases of Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo), and likable characters.  It's a superhero movie, so don't expect anything in depth, but it is a fun movie.",8
"Jun 6, 2013","The Avengers. It's what they call themselves, sort of like a team. ""Earth's Mightiest Heroes"" type thing. Yeah, takes them a while to get any traction, I'll give you that one. But let's do a head count here: A demi-god; a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins. They have a Freakin Hulk!!

This movie is everything a comic book movie should be.",10
"May 31, 2013","As a guy who enjoys superhero movies, I have to say that The Avengers is one of the best superhero movies of all time. Robert Downey Jr. was great as Iron Man. Chris Evans was great as Captain America. Mark Ruffalo was fantastic as Bruce Banner and Tom Hiddleston was amazing as Loki, who is one of my favorite super villains ever. The plot was extraordinary. Just do yourself a favor and watch this movie.",10
"May 30, 2013","I'm not gonna lie, this movie was absolutely amazing! Also, if I'm being completely honest, I went in assuming it would be another highly overrated superhero movie that couldn't like up to the hype. It definitely wouldn't be the first time I disagreed with the critics. Boy was I mistaken. Outside of the films from Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, this is easily the best superhero movie ever made. They plot developed perfectly, the action sequences were incredible, there were a lot of unexpectedly humorous scenes and dialogue, and the characters and actors were all great. One of my concerns going in was how they would possibly give each character their fair shake. Well the great Joss Whedon did a great job keeping a perfect balance between staying true to the individual characters while further introducing a developing Black Widow and Hawkeye. Another thing, Mark Ruffalo did a marvelous job as Bruce Banner. A lot of people were worried about him in that role and were upset about the change from Edward Norton. Maybe it's because I'm biased and loathe Norton but I thought Ruffalo did a better job as Banner. I wouldn't have minded them focusing a little more time on the Hawkeye character and I wouldn't have minded if they actually squeezed in Natalie Portman's character for a quick scene or two but the movie really didn't need it. I just think if you can put Portman on screen, you put Portman on screen, lol. I also wouldn't have minded if they focused a bit more on the villainous pawns and where they come from but I have a feeling we'll find out more about them in the following Avengers sequels so I can't be too upset about that. All in all, if you like superhero movies, action movies, or just kick ass movies in general, you should like this movie too.",10
"May 27, 2013","I don't like all characters,  Iron Man, Captain America,  The Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and antagonist. Their weaon, costume, armor is very unattractive. I don't like superhero movies. They are invincible, they always win easily. That is why I love protagonist from horror movies or mafia movie, the protagonist dies or survive. Protagonist who try to survive with kitchen knife, axe, or pistol with 3 bullets, like Erin from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.",0
"May 24, 2013",I love this movie. The special affects were excellent and I love how the characters have to come together and work on the same side instead of all going there own way. I hope the next movie is as good.,9
"May 22, 2013","This movie pulls off what it is trying to do perfectly. The acting is great, the plot, while not complex, works, and the visual effects are stunning. While not as good as The Dark Knight Rises, This movie perfectly does what it set out to do.  But seriously, during the last big fight, how are they talking to each other without earpieces?",10
"May 19, 2013",This movie is terrible the story is dog  and I don't see why people buzz about it I turned it off after 40 mins and Loki come on why not red skull...,1
"May 15, 2013","The mother of all Superhero movies. Really enjoyed it, Absolutely Electrified me.  The Avengers definitely was the cherry on top of the cake of Marvels Phase 1 and will be loved by fans in this entire realm for Generations to come.",10
"May 13, 2013","This is last year's summer blockbuster. The Avengers has its moments and you won't fall asleep, but it is a bit too busy, probably because it has five or six superheroes too many, including two from Norse mythology. I'm not sure that Loki and Thor count as superheroes. Thor is the Norse god of thunder; in this film, he is frequently depicted wielding a gold oversized hammer that looks like a giant dreidel. Loki is, according to mythology, a rather weird loner **** who causes all kinds of mischief, and he is famous for being a shapeshifter, an attribute which is not explored in this story. In this film, Loki is the mad genius who wants to destroy the world, the typical villain that turns up in every superhero movie from Batman to Austin Powers to the T-Rex in Jurassic Park. In Norse mythology, Loki is constantly fouling things up, and he is not a nice god, but he doesn't have enough ambition or smarts to try to destroy the planet.

For example, in a famous mythological scene, Odin, the chief god, is on planet Earth strolling along to pay a respectful visit the King of the Dwarves. Odin is accompanied by Loki and another god. The King's son is also a shapeshifter, and the son is lounging by the stream in the shape of an otter. Loki sees the otter, and all he can think is “lunch,” so while Odin walks on ahead, Loki stops to kill the otter, throw it over his shoulders, and then give the poor Dwarf King a real shock when he enters the house a few minutes behind Odin, carrying some delectable meat. This causes Odin all kinds of problems, as he then has to find a way to give the Dwarf King restitution for the death of his son. Tom Hiddleston as Loki does a very good portrayal of unrelenting evil, but the relation to the mythological Loki is weak.

Even Robert Downey Jr. gets lost in the sauce, since his Iron Man has much less screen time here than what he's used to, and he's sharing the set with too many other A-listers. Downey is a little out of shape in this film, a state he seems to have recently corrected, but the main problem is that Iron Man as a team player doesn't seem to work. Mark Ruffalo's the Hulk is so hulking and destructive that he gets on your nerves. He's a bull in a china shop, and his massive destructiveness is a little annoying. The pleasant surprise is Scarlett Johansson as the Black Widow. Her best scene is when she's tied to a chair and is seemingly being interrogated, if not tortured, but in fact she is the one conducting the interrogation by asking a lot of questions while perceived as being in a state of bondage from which she cannot escape. When she has to answer her cell phone, she drops the ruse, beats everybody up, and gets back to the office. That scene is worth the rest of the movie.

The film is entertaining on a somewhat juvenile level, but given that it made over a billion dollars, the producers are obviously not concerned about high art with respect to this genre.",5
"May 13, 2013","I don't know if I'm missing something here. I felt like the Avengers had it's moments, but they were moments. The movie was predominantly stupid, which is frustrating. I watched the avengers act like children. I watched both the avengers, and the bad guys make dumb decisions. Hawkeye, you blew up one engine with an arrow. Why not blow up two, or three, or four? Oh, okay. You're going to hack the system to shut down the other one. Right. And I feel like this would be acceptable, if the film owned up to it. If there was some reason that being dumb was okay. But it didn't major plot twists were created, and solved on mistakes, jealousies, and blunders. That's a lot less fun than cleverness.",3
"May 12, 2013","Everything happens very fast which helps maintain a constant climax, with a story that humanizes the heroes, and scenes as spectacular as those of Transformers 3, what could be better is the largest participation of Thor and Captain America, and the decentralization of the plot in Iron Man and Hulk.",9
"Apr 26, 2013","Not only is The Avengers a great film by itself, its also a great; Iron Man movie, Captain America movie, Hulk movie and Thor movie. With the huge potential of failure from the unprecedented build up, it is one of the biggest comic book achievements ever",9
"Apr 17, 2013","Why.  Why is there support for a bland film such as this? I'm telling you, it's just not that good.  The characters are virtually the same.  None of them have any real interesting characteristics or attributes that grabbed my attention other than Samuel L. Jackson simply because he is Samuel L. Jackson.  Robert Downey Jr. and the other Avengers all act at the same level of social communication, but they jut have arguments in between to fool the audience that there is tension in the film.  The villain is a laughable archetype in the movie, included with the most original lines such as ""I will rule this world"" and ""The end of this world is nigh"".  80% of the movie takes place on the airship with nothing to do but squabble and run into accidents.  It's extremely boring, and the special effects and ""classic comic lines"" are not worth my time nor should they be worth anybody's.  The Avengers does not deserve the praise it gets.",4
"Apr 7, 2013","This is hands down the best super hero movie made to-date, and I've seen them all. At over 2 hours and 20 minutes, it is wholly captivating, perfectly balancing character development, team development (which is critical for this movie) and eye-popping 3D action. This is no small feat, bringing together the six ""heroes."". Even the minor characters are brought to the forefront (Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye and Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, for example), enriching their characters and making their action sequences just as cool and dynamic.

And surprisingly, it is the best Hulk movie. There are two scenes featuring the Hulk that will have you laughing so hard you'll be in tears. You'd think Iron Man would have the coolest action sequences, but when the Hulk inflicts carnage on the enemies, you don't want it to stop.

This is Josh Whedon's breakout movie. No longer will he be known as ""the guy that made the Buffy the Vampire Slayer series,"" but the guy that made The Avengers.",9
"Apr 6, 2013","As I write this review, the Avengers is my personal favorite movie. The Avengers is an absolute blast, featuring mind-blowing special effects and CGI, great performances all around, and humor that makes this an all-around incredible movie.

My personal favorites in this movie were Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man and Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk. Robert Downey, Jr. brought back more of his sarcastic and witty comments that make him the best character in the movie. However, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner was just incredible. He played the part very well. As for the Hulk, he was awesome.

I also have to applaud the other cast members (Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Scarlett Johannsenn, Jeremy Renner). They all did very well in their respective roles and I felt that Loki was a very good villain.

Overall, this is an absolutely stunning movie that every has to see at some point.",10
"Apr 2, 2013","When the demoman from Team Fortress 2 is involved in your movie, you're doing something right. People, you need to follow the likes of this movie, because it is simply amazing. Please watch this movie",10
"Mar 30, 2013","Wow ""HULK SMASH,"" his way in to give this movie a 10 easy! How could I give it anything else after watching the Hulk!? Is it even possible, nope not for me. This move is a must watch! I don`t know what anybody who does not like this movie was expecting. Did you think this was ""A Beautiful Mind"" part two? At first I wondered how they would make all the heroes come together, but they did a great job with it. All the characters fit right in. The critics are crazy for not liking this, I don`t know why they even exist, everybody should have their own opinions on movies and everything in life. If you just listen to critics, or even friends you will miss out on allot of things you actually would like.",10
"Mar 27, 2013",Just a bunch of fighting scenes with less than desirable dialogue and plot.,5
"Mar 23, 2013","A popcorn movie that gets everything a popcorn movie needs right. It's got the special effects, cheesy dialogue and like-able characters, but it does it all effortlessly and is one of the best superhero movies to date.",9
"Mar 23, 2013","I was surprised, this movie is really good, I thought it was another of Transformers, but it was really smart and funny.
The result was not only a blast, but also led to more adaptations, including the coveted 'Spiderman' walked many years ago stuck in an economically unviable Study (Carolco) and promoters like James Cameron who remained in the way.
They know how to count and give casual joke humorous, sad not like Michael Bay attempts to do so. The performances are really good by the entire cast, especially that of Tom Hiddleston, is really good and hae see Loki's character as a great and dangerous villain of comic books, and my opinion much deserved every award nomination.
The visual effects and uncountable stages are really amazing, definitely an Oscar nomination in this.
What I did not like was that it is very predictable, so I tend to like movies, I like movies when something unexpected happens, but here there was exepcion, also becomes longer and that can be very annoying as the movie.
Nearly two hours of footage, and how difficult was entertained. In the end it was hard not to. Not drops, not weakens and does not disappoint, with all the spectacular and the technique allows exploiting the potential in each frame which was holding. If you had to hang a picture next to the term 'blockbuster popping' the heroes traveling on the streets of New York would be the ideal.

'The Avengers' have joined. They do not separate the precipitated sequels.
Good Movie.
My Score: 9.3",9
"Mar 17, 2013",An exciting thrill ride from start to finish.  This is exactly what you expect in a summer block buster.  It's not easy to take this many superheroes and keep all the characters relevant that's a credit to Joss Whedon.,9
"Mar 16, 2013","It is one of 2012 best movies. It is suitable for just any age. Iron man, Hulk, Captain America etc... are awesome. I just don't know why did critics gave it 60 while it has a score of 92 on rotten tomatoes and it deserves 92. Buy it on DVD or wait until its TV release. Recommended for anyone.",10
"Mar 8, 2013","A horrible movie, definitely did not deserve the money it made. I can't think of a lot of things that I actually liked about the movie, because there really aren't a lot. I was actually surprised at the story of the movie, it sounds like a mentally challenged child wrote it. The first ten minutes of the movie alone ruined it, it's just a horrible story that only idiots would like. The entire movie is pretty much just special effects and not much else. Unless you're one of those morons whose easily amused by the pretty lights on the screen, don't ever watch this movie.",2
"Feb 19, 2013","This film is not as good as everyone said it was. It is quite bland, seemed somewhat lifeless and was backed up by a lacking storyline. But, it was quite good fun; despite the problems I had with the story, the acting was of a pretty high standard from most of the cast, particularly from the main antagonist of the film, who was creepy, strong and weak at all the right times, perhaps a little stale at times however. The music was forgettable, the action was good, but not outstanding, and even though every character got a good amount of time in the limelight, it felt like Iron Man and Black Widow's film. The film is very conventionally shot, no nice camera tricks or spectacular shots appeared in the movie, this is not so much a negative of the film: but it certainly could have been better. Overall though, The Avengers is a fun film, that will definitely appeal more to fans of the Avengers, but both the Amazing Spiderman and the Dark Knight Rises present a more appealing superhero movie for 2012. Decent fun, but flawed. 68/100.",7
"Feb 9, 2013","I still cannot believe I wasted my money on this, what a complete and utter waste of time! I am shocked by the fact people thought this movie was great. I mean the acting was poor, the screenplay was laughable and the directing was far from perfect. It's so sad that people don't know good movies anymore these days.",3
"Jan 28, 2013","The Avengers is the best Marvel comic book movie ever made. This movie had great action, great acting, and a great plot. It's 143 minutes of pure awesomeness and excitement. Also this movie had fantastic acting from Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, and Tom Hiddleston. This is one of my favorite films of all time. This is the best film of 2012 by far.",6
"Jan 24, 2013","It is the closest to perfection a comic book movie adaptation can get. I really can not say too much else. I found almost nothing wrong with it, however, I do feel they could have gotten a more prominent Villain. Loki was convincing and a worthy foe, but it just felt like they could have gone up against someone more sinister than an Asgardian with daddy issues. Still, a fantastic film that I can watch over and over. How on earth did Cobie Smulders get cast in this movie? Quite the big leap from TV sitcom to ...... this. There's nothing wrong with her, I was just pleasantly surprised.",9
"Jan 22, 2013","Considering the number of movies that came out this year, the Avengers stand near the top of the list. It balances the creation of the superheroes with the dynamic of peoples whom all would have such huge egos having to come together as a team. The comedy is amazing and creates that sense of distrust between the superheroes due to these egos. The invasion at the end is somewhat ruined by the ""Phantom menace Droid Army Syndrome"" but beyond that was a solid movie.",8
"Jan 19, 2013","I began watching this movie expecting something decent, but nothing too exceptional. However, it really was pretty good. I don't claim that the Avengers film was a brilliant piece of work, but it entertained me, and at the end of the day that's what I'm after.",8
"Jan 17, 2013","I obviously don't hold the popular opinion here, but to me this movie just didn't measure up. I've seen both Iron Man movies, Captain America, and many of the past Marvel movies including characters featured in this film, and I thought most if not all of them were better than this one. Maybe it's just that I've outgrown the more playful and mindlessly violent tone of these types of movies, but to me the movie just felt childish and simplistic. I realize that in a way, it's a great triumph seeing this crazy symphony of classic Marvel characters clashing with enemies and sometimes themselves, which in a way makes it the perfect superhero movie, but it just doesn't seem to create the same type of captivation one would expect from such an ordeal. It just feels goofy and undeveloped in a sense, unfortunately.",4
"Jan 17, 2013",I like this movie but it isn't my favorite.,9
"Jan 12, 2013","It's not every day a film comes along that has such an exciting, fast pace, but also has such a satisfactory, witty script, good actors, a genuinely slimy villain in the tradition of Basil Rathbone, and spectacular action sequences that do not go on and on, but thrill. Take the opportunity to watch this one. It's well worth the money.",8
"Jan 11, 2013",The avengers is the best movie with best cast.I can't wait till avengers 2 comes out. Avengers is the best super hero movie. Bat man is nothing compered to the avengers.,10
"Jan 9, 2013","I hate starting **** review with a rant, but really? Comparing this movie to Transformers? Only league where this was the same as Transformers were the groundbreaking special effects, simple as that.
Director Joss Whedon has created a film that has a mixture of all of our favourite fanboy fantasies, a near-perfect script in which the title characters, particularly (and as usual) Robert Downey Jr, i mean, who else but Whedon's dark yet comical understanding of the genre and Downey Jr's witty delivery could get away with labelling Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth) as ""Point Break"" or calling Clint 'Hawkeye' Barton (Jeremy Renner) Legolas? Simple little bows to other genres captivate this into a gloriously fresh and surprisingly funny film, and a wonderful beginning to more Avengers.
The excellently diverse Tom Hiddlestone reprises his role as Thor's brother, Loki, who attempts to capture the Tesseract, which first appeared in Captain America (again played by Chris Evans).
What differentiates this ensemble film from the rest? Well for starters, all our superheroes are on the same screen, Joss Whedon is clearly not afraid to lend screen time to develop other stories, particularly Renner's Hawkeye and the return of Scarlett Johansson's delectably dangerous Black Widow. We also see the return of the most fearsome, yet difficult hero of them all, the one we have yet to see a favourable film about, Hulk. Taking over from Ed Norton,we see Mark Ruffalo taking the reigns, and quite honestly the dialogue between him and Downey Jr is not to be missed or forgotten. The interactions between all characters is unmissable. Phil Coulson returns and his as deadpan hilarious as ever, lining himself to play a pivotal role in the film.
what please me the most watching the Avengers was how Whedon has expertly divided the screen time between all our heroes, while still maintaining a thriving story and not leaving the human characters out in the cold.
The battle of Manhattan is stunning to watch,whether it was witnessing Iron Man bounce rays off Cap's shield to defeat enemies, Thor and Hulk teaming to fight the alien race or Black Widow and Hawkeye nitpicking with their respective skills, each member had a part to play, but it was indeed Ruffalo's Hulk who stole the show, his humorous 'other guy' stance regarding the Hulk, his nervous yet accepting persona and of course his dialogue with Tony Stark was just excellent. This was smart, sophisticated, funny, pop cultured and fun, everything Transformers wasn't. As my current re-watch favourite, this is easily the best superhero movie in a long while, suit up, grab your shield, hammer, and turn green, then watch, watch and watch again.",10
"Jan 9, 2013","My main concern with The Avengers was, in encompassing all of the members, the film would be spread too thinly between the characters, resulting in a watered down attempt to integrate characters and personalities, a little like the X-men films. Thankfully this is not the case, although it's interesting that co-writer Zak Penn was involved in two of the X-men group films. Penn and Joss Whedon find enough screen-time for all the Avengers and by introducing them gradually through the film's opening third, sufficient emphasis is placed on each character. Similarly, I was disappointed when I discovered that the film's antagonist would be Loki, as I was not overly impressed with him in Thor. Again though, due to Hiddlestone's improved performance this time around and with Whedon's direction, I felt Loki was a much more interesting villain and one more fitting of the collective's film.

The team dynamic of between the superheroes is what really makes the film, alongside the blockbuster action sequences. Thor and Hulk clash, Captain America and Tony Stark routinely throw barbs at each other while Stark shows a surprisingly sincere side when offering support to Bruce Banner. Mark Ruffalo plays Banner with a sense of fear and regret of his destructive, uncontrollable power and I found him to be the most interesting character of the team. There's a slightly contrived back-story thrown in to give Hawkeye and Black Widow something of interest but its the funny moments between Stark and co. that gives the film its spark. Samuel. L. Jackson's brings his usual 'don't mess with me' cool factor and his larger role also benefits the movie. Being critical, I'm not sure the plot gave enough explanation as to why Banner returned to fight alongside the others after showing nothing but resistance to let 'the other guy' appear, or how he was able to control Hulk more effectively in contrast with the film's earlier events.

The so called Battle of New York finale is a really exciting well-directed battle, especially when you consider it's similarities to the frantic city battles Michael Bay treated us to in his Transformer films.

A genuine action blockbuster fit for it's cast.",8
"Jan 7, 2013","This is by far the best Marvel film released. It avoids the forced Hollywood romance plot while delivering copious amounts of Marvel fanservice. With the exception of Captain America, I feel that each of the Marvel characters had a chance to showcase their talents. Not only that, but there's a good amount of humor in this film as well.",10
"Jan 6, 2013",Brainless action with no real story or character's development. The movie has tons of special effects and cgs but in the end it feels more like a colorful candy that is rotten inside. Almost complete garbage.,3
"Jan 6, 2013","Probably much more enjoyable on the big screen -- and I'm sure it would have been more enjoyable for a comic book aficionado. But its appearance on some of the critics' ""best"" lists made me curious. Campy costumes and a primary-colored plot (to the extent that there was one) made it fun in spots, but for me could not make up for the cheesy dialogue and silly story. Robert Downey Jr. had most of the best lines and wittily made good use of them; his performance definitely was  the highlight.",5
"Jan 6, 2013",This movie was just bad. I love Joss Whedon but he needs a guy sitting over him while he is writing to tell him his jokes aren't funny. They chose the storyline that doesn't connect with the others on the least likeable character. All the other avengers are really good at something or science gave them powers but Thor is just a heavy handed dueche that has powers because of the cop out that he is a god. There were redeeming factors due to the Sp. Effects and Scarlett Johanson's butt.,5
"Jan 5, 2013",Got to be the best movie i saw in 2012. Great cast a very simplistic but decent story and some good dialogue. One of the things i like about this film and it gets so right is a GREAT final battle in the last 45 minutes which just looks amazing. alot of theese comic book movie films have theese crap 1-2 minute ones that are just so lame and anticlimactic that it almost makes the movie feel like a waste. The one problem is though you have a great team of super heroes fighting one guy names loki and his army of Alien things. would have been so much cooler if it was a team of villians. Oh well for Avengers 2 then hopefully. Other then that don't waste your time seeing this in 3D . This was my first 3D movie i rented for my 3D TV and the 3D just felt tacked on outside of a few moments when it looked cool. Avengers in the end has to be the best Comic book to movie out there so far.,9
"Jan 5, 2013","The Avengers is shockingly phony, corny and cheesy. The movie is extremely clumsy with too many characters with all their personal backgrounds. The story and movie completely fall apart wth the lack of chemistry between any of the superheros. An action spectacle wth very little to show for.",3
"Jan 3, 2013",This is one of the most overrated movies I've seen this year. A weak and predictable plot masked by tons of action and great special effects.  Limited character development also made it difficult to be invested in any of the characters. A waste **** cast.,4
"Jan 1, 2013","Why do you want a heavy-weight storyline when you have The Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America etc.. and enough bad guys to beat up! Sit back and enjoy, goes easy on the brains.",9
"Dec 31, 2012",great fun must watch movie for all those who likes super heroes.Incredible way to accommodate 6 heroes in a single movie although character of Tony and Hulk was overshadowing but thats the way it is..,10
"Dec 31, 2012","This is a very silly movie that is Swiss-cheese full of holes. If your thing is Marvel comic books, and you really want to see eponymous figures from the various comics come together then... this is for you I guess (unless having heroes pointlessly bickering to create faux dramatic tension gets on your nerves).

Its got some spectacle I suppose. Silly spectacle that ultimately makes no sense (flying, invisible aircraft carrier that is vulnerable when flying, typically doesn't bother engaging invisibility, has nuclear missiles but can only launch them... from other aircraft... Hell the entire carrier almost gets taken out by an... exploding arrow... Christ). Get drunk if you are going to try and watch this film - it really, really helps.",4
"Dec 30, 2012","Like all good superhero movies, its a slow buildup to great action. Unlike bad superhero movies, its incredibly well-acted without being too dark or too whimsical.",7
"Dec 28, 2012","After dozens of teasers hidden in each of the heroes individual movies The Avengers is finally here, and it doesn't disappoint. It's filled with draw dropping action, and some hilarious moments. Every superhero is excellently fleshed out and work well together, and no hero receives more attention than another. It excellently captures the feel of each individual hero as well as show some new sides of their personalities. The Avengers is everything I wanted it to be, and I don't see how it could have turned out any better. It's one of the best superhero movies of all time.",9
"Dec 25, 2012","Hawkeye, Black Widow just doesn't fit right in the avengers, the threat which is beyond any well trained human abilities just cannot be mitigated with special bows and guns... don't see what these 2 have done that could not be done with any regular army soldier. I didn't like the ending they made it too easy, a LARGE invading army coming from another dimension with advanced weapons and technology should not be easily beaten, I want the avengers to win ofcourse but it should have been harder for them and the drama could have easily been harder (Loki is just weak for someone with his powers). Still I recommend the movie it is fun!",8
"Dec 25, 2012","Pedestrian pacing, clichéd dialogue and a generic plot. Yes, it's a super-hero movie; an over-hyped, big-budget, disengage your brain and chew your popcorn series of action sequences littered with painfully two-dimensional cardboard cut-out characters (with exception to Ruffalo's Hulk, arguably the only decent part of the film). One of the trailers preceding the film was advertising toys; there's your target audience: children.",5
"Dec 16, 2012","Now 6 years ago when Iron Man hit the big screens we were promised the Avengers. Now the problem I thought I was going to have with this movie was that there were too many characters to base the whole movie on , but the director Joss Whedon does an excellent job with bringing all these characters together. When it is a scene with Iron Man played by Robert Downey Jr it is all about Iron Man. When it is a scene with Captain America played bey Chris Evans it is all about Captain America. The character that surprised me the most was Loki played by Tom Hiddleston. He was a dark villain in Thor and now he is an even darker villain in the Avengers. He is just so bad ass with his chitari army. This movie is 2 hours long and it feels like half an hour because it is so thrilling and intense. Avengers Assemble is MARVELous.",10
"Dec 14, 2012","Well, it's The Avengers. I shouldn't have to say more. But I will.

I haven't seen the superhero movies leading up to this. I've only seen the Hulk sequel (the Edward Norton one), Iron Man, and Thor. While there were times when I was lost, I could follow this movie's plot. I need to seen Iron Man 2 since it has Nick Fury and Black Widow.

LOKI! I'm not one of those crazy obsessive Loki fangirls, but I loved Loki in this movie. That being said, I still found it hilarious when the Hulk picked him up and slammed him around. Funniest part of the movie.

What's good about this movie is that it strikes a good balance between comedy and drama. Joss Whedon knows the Avengers don't need the Dark Knight treatment and wisely did not go that route. But wasn't unbelievably cartoony and silly either. It knew when to be serious and when to make the audience laugh.

The characters were fun and each actor played the role well. Hawkeye didn't get much to do but it it got Jeremy Renner in a tight outfit. Good enough for me! The newest addition to the cast was Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk. He fit the role unbelievably well. Makes sense since Ruffalo has proven time and again that he's a fantastic actor.

There isn't much else for me to say about this. See it if you haven't already.

One more thing: Coulson lives!",8
"Dec 7, 2012",Awesome.,10
"Dec 7, 2012","I found absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, the character backgrounds/back stories may not have been explained, but it was said in the previous movies before this one. THE EPICEST MOVIE EVER (so far) in my opinion, 10(.5)/10",10
"Dec 5, 2012","I loved this movie! I saw it 3 times in theaters and I'm not ashamed to admit that. The reason I liked this film so much was because it was everything it could and should have been; for a blockbuster, that's a mighty accomplishment...(Full Review Later)...",9
"Dec 4, 2012","My most honest opinion as a Marvel fan: this movie is an absolute piece of garbage and overrated as hell. It's just as dumb and moronic as Bay's Transformers by only focusing on big budget special effects and random silly jokes. I give it a 2/10 because Mark Ruffalo was the only good thing about this film otherwise it would have been a 0/10.

It's good for little kids but those 3D animated movies have much more depth than The Avengers. This movie could lower theirs and your IQ.",2
"Nov 30, 2012","Marvel has always dominated the superhero movie genre, and with its giant marketing buildup to this film, it's easy to see how this could have become one of cinema's tragic flops. But oh no. ""The Avengers"" is THE superhero movie of all superhero movies. It's got fantastic, epic action, breathtaking visual effects, and a very strongly-written story packed with thrills and truly hilarious moments. Each character gets their moments in the sun, each gets their own story arc, we see them fight each other and with each other, and ultimately it all comes together for a completely satisfying 5-star experience that really raises the bar for all superhero flicks to come.",10
"Nov 28, 2012",A glowing example of what action movies should be like - a perfect blend of intelligence and thrills.,9
"Nov 24, 2012","The Avengers is first culmination of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and makes history as it is the first big screen film that brings together Marvel's cinematic heros and is a direct sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, and Thor. Plot: Loki (Tom Hiddleston) accquires the mysterious power of the Tesseract which is capable of possessing the human heart and almost anything else. Nick Fury, director of Shield (Samuel Jackson) brings together The Avengers for the first time in an attempt to prevent Loki from terrorizing Earth. Captain America: Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) has just been thawed out after being frozen for 67 years and has not aged but has forever lost the love of his life through time and is dedicated to the protection of his country, he plays the mature Captain of The Avengers and is the voice of reason. Iron Man: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is a billionaire and owner of Stark Industries. After creating his new arc reactor for his heart, he has expanded its size and created Stark Tower which is a prototype to test off his most cost effiecient source of energy. He plays the comedy relief and one of the most intelligent of The Avengers. The Incredible Hulk: Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) had gone back into hiding after he aided the US army in defeating the Abomination. When he is forced to become a Shield scientist, he must learn to control his anger in order to not become a hazard. He plays the hot head, and one of the most intelligent of The Avengers. Thor(Chris Hemsworth): After destroying the rainbow bridge connecting the realm of Earth to Asgard, Odin casts dark magic in order to send Thor back to Earth in order to persuade Loki that although he will never be King or the true Odinson, he will always be part of the family. He plays the most serious Avenger for Loki is the main reason he was sent back to Earth, and the power Loki wields threatens the safety of the nine realms which is his responsibility as King of Asgard. Black Widow: Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) is an agent of Shield who is trained to be a master of disguise and flexible combat. She plays the sexy, yet troubled Avenger. Hawkeye: Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) is an agent of Shield who is trained to have perfect accuracy with his bow and arrow. Early on however, Loki possess him which makes him a part of his army. He plays the Avenger gone bad. My opinion: This is movie history in one of its finest forms. It is a must see even if you haven't seen the tie in movies which I would definintly reccomend before watching this masterpiece.",10
"Nov 13, 2012","There are a lot of people giving this movie a perfect ten out of ten. This is understandable, but only if you are going into it thinking its a family movie. The Avengers is relatively tame, contains cheap, slapstick humor (take the Captain America trading cards for example), and the plot is extremely simple and easy to follow. Though these detract from the movie in my personal opinion, there are some upsides if you are like me and prefer a more complex action movie. The special effects are amazing, the cast is, for the most part, star studded, and if you have invested time in the other movies leading up to The Avengers there are references that reward the viewer. That being said, if you are either going as a family, or a fan of the other movie, you will enjoy The Avengers. However, if you were not interested in the past movies leading up to The Avengers and are looking for a complex, non-linear plot, than this may not be the movie for you.",7
"Nov 13, 2012","HULK SMASH!

The beginning of the film is quite slow but the 2nd half is pure action. For some reason i didnt expect much from this film and boy was i surprised by the end of it. Excellent film and i cant wait for part 2. Before watching this film you have to see all the marvel films from iron man 1 onwards and all the little easter eggs/cameos in them just to enjoy this film more!",9
"Nov 9, 2012","Every single thing about this movie is beautiful.  I have actually lost count of how many times I have seen it, and it really is that rewatchable.  The acting is awesome, the writing is HILARIOUS, and the action scenes are, for lack of a better word, epic.  That said, this is not a movie for those who love ""serious"" film.  It's a lighthearted action-y superhero movie.  If you go into it expecting Shakespeare, you're obviously going to come out disappointed.  Things blow up.  Scarlett Johansson is in a catsuit.  Tony snarks.  ...it's really just perfect.",10
"Nov 9, 2012","I finally saw Avengers the other night. I was expecting so much more from Joss Whedon. Where were the deep conflicted characters and the witty dialogue that I'm used to from Firefly and Buffy? This movie was too much like Transformers. It was way too heavy on action and special effects, with little to no character development. Also, I just can't get past how cheesy the costumes were, especially the villain's. I mean what was with those ridiculous horns?? I fell asleep about 6 times during the movie and kept waking myself up because I was waiting for it to get good. It just never happened. With all the amazing writers out there struggling for work why are we having to put up with this crap on the silver screen?",3
"Nov 7, 2012",I was exhausted at the end of this movie.  The Avengers is a nonstop high speed roller coaster ride.  I must admit I was never a fan of the comic book which always kind of read like the comics version of the Allstar game and their are some cheesy moments like Iron Mans AC-DC theme music (we get it already).  Whedon somehow turns the swashbuckling superhero movie into a brutal gritty slugfest.  At the end you feel as beat up as the combatants.  Well done.,9
"Nov 5, 2012","Whedon's Avengers is very entertaining. The dialogue is snappy when present, and the  visual effects are great, but in the end, sensation trumps feeling.",6
"Oct 14, 2012","Less than impressed with this film given its stellar reviews upon release. It is one of those not so rare cases of style over substance, the style being fight scenes and blowing stuff up before coming to an inevitable conclusion of saving the world together and going their separate ways. The attempts at comedy are laboured and obviously, like the film, directed at a popcorn chomping audience where films are to be enjoyed with minds switched off. The emotional climaxes in the film also seemed contrived and insincere, as is the case with many big budget films lacking in story and human connection. Firstly are we really meant to care about agent coulson dying merely because we are told 20 minutes before he died he ideolized captain america? And secondly what is the point in pretending to kill off iron man when all of the audience has seen that moment in the trailer a million times when the hulk catches iron man out of the sky and destroys a building in the process? Obviously they were not going to sacrifice a main character in this kind of a film when the secondary ones will suffice for audience emotional interaction. Joss Whedon, a genius, really?",6
"Oct 14, 2012",I really tried to love this film but when the plot holes are beyond obvious it is hard and unexplained actions were even worse. Half of S.H.I.E.L.D didn't even need to be there. It didn't stop it being enjoyable. Robert Downey Jr. was the highlight of this film. Still worth watching.,5
"Oct 8, 2012","A perfectly average superhero movie...

I didn't see this for a while and some friends hyped it up as the best thing ever. I was pretty disappointed to begin with, because at the start there are some problems with the main characters. With having so many it was bound to happen... but still, it just doesn't feel right and I can't put my finger on it. Having said that, later on it gets better... much better. The characters find their niches and they come to life. I was just hoping they'd be a bit more interesting beforehand. They contrast nicely and work better than in their own films at times. There are some great action sequences and some memorable moments and it's all very fun. It's just not very complicated at all. I was expecting more a X-Men First Class or Watchmen vibe to it. (I know that was a silly idea now)

The problem is that you'd expect a film like this to blow you away and really immerse you, but honestly I turned it off halfway through and came back to it. Where as with First Class I watched it start to finish and then went back to some scenes again because it was soooo bad-ass. It takes a while to get going and then never really goes anywhere *that* interesting once it does. This is probably because the whole point of the film was to bring the avengers together and set them up for a sequel. If that's it then fair play, good film, point made. But First Class did that AND gave the guys something pretty interesting to do and also make some bold claims about sociology. ( I do love and highly recommend that film)

All in all it's alright. If you are going to see it, you've probably seen it by now. If not, catch it on Sky Movies in a few months or something when you're bored because it's not that special. On the other hand if you fancy a very good superhero-group origin film, with some top acting, interesting characters and a bit more depth... watch X-Men First Class.",5
"Oct 5, 2012","Joss Whedon's widely influenced summer spectacular offers 130 minutes of popcorn-friendly fun, yet fails to deliver anything more than run-of-the-mill escapist entertainment. Tom Hiddleston is superb as Shakespearian villain Loki and Mark Ruffallo gives The Hulk some heart, yet the film's character development is minimal, its plot slow and formulaic, and its screenplay drizzled in gooey one-liners and excessive fanboy cream. Things pick up a little during the final act, but even a swooping, snarling Manhattan sky-battle isn't enough to save The Avengers from feeling bloated and underwhelming.",4
"Oct 4, 2012","I have no idea why this has been panned so much by the Critics on this site.  It's probably one of the best Superhero movies to date.  Funny, all action with some brilliant performances by the cast, I can't help wondering why the hell this only scored 69.  Still, at least the real film buffs understand (i.e those that do user reviews).  I can't help thinking that so many critics only write reviews in a bid to draw attention to themselves instead of actually giving honest assessments of films and games.

Anyway, ignore the Critic Score and just get this movie.  It's not too serious and it's highly enjoyable!",9
"Oct 3, 2012","This is the way 3D should be displayed on every 3D TV with the proper Aspect Ratio of 1.78:1 which will fill the whole screen without the horrible ""black bars"".  That alone makes this release one of the best ones on 3D.

The Aspect Ratio of: 1.78:1 takes this movie in 3D to a whole new level without the annoying ""black bars"" on top and bottom of the screen.

Usually I don't mind those ""black bars"" on 2D viewing, maybe because we are all used to it by now, plus it doesn't take anything **** ON 3D viewing this is the complete opposite. WHY SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS ASPECT RATIO?:
For those of us who already hated the so called ""black bars"" on top and bottom of the screen while watching a regular movie, this is really bad for 3D Home viewers, as this WILL TAKE AWAY FROM WHAT MAKES 3D WORTH THE PURCHASE TO BEGIN WITH, minimizing the effect by a big percentage, unless you have a 80"" 3D TV which I'm pretty such most of us don't have.

SO WHAT'S THE ""APPROPRIATE"" ASPECT RATIO THAT SHOULD BE IN 3D HOME MOVIES?
Most 3D movies right now are NOT being released with the desirable Aspect Ratio that will fill the whole screen giving you the whole 3D effect BUT movies like Wrath Of The Titans, and the soon to be released AVATAR 3D, are some of the very few that could display with an average Aspect Ratio of: 1.78:1 WHICH WILL take advantage of your New 3D TV as you expected to display from day one.

With that said, This movie fortunately does support that type of Aspect Ratio which is completely worth spending the extra few dollars on the 3D Bluray version. Even with an enormous TV set you wouldn't want to watch a 3D movie with the black bars **** bigger the TV, the bigger the ""black bars"" .

ABOUT THE MOVIE:
I did LOVE this movie when I went to see in IMAX 3D, I think it had a good use of the technology. STORY: This is certainly the BEST comic to film translation, and yes, I did like Batman the Dark Knight Rises, but not as much as this one. SPECIAL EFFECTS: The special effects although not groundbreaking they were certainly eye-candy, and what really makes it stand out from the pack is how well the director and his team were able to put everything together and make it look Amazing all **** EVEN BETTER IN BLURAY 3D AND ITS AMAZING 1.77:1 ASPECT RATIO TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE ENTIRE SCREEN.

If you have a 3D TV and a 3D BluRay player, this movie will certainly make you proud of that investment...I know it did for me.",10
"Sep 30, 2012",Very overrated movie. The story  was not as good as other super hero movies like batman but the action kept it alive. Worth seeing but don't expect it to blow your mind.,7
"Sep 30, 2012","The Avengers is a fun summer blockbuster, as it should be. It's a movie that fulfills its purpose, it doesn't tries to be dark, like many films these days, its just a flick that blends comedy and action, and The Avengers does that perfectly.",8
"Sep 30, 2012","I grew up reading Marvel comic books and I love the way they are being brought back to life.  We need heroes in the times we have today.   We do have heroes they are the men and women of The United States Armed Forces. Thank you...
Demmi Moore said it best in one of her early films.  ''They Are The Ones That Stand on The Wall to Make sure We Are Safe''.",10
"Sep 29, 2012","A great movie, which knows what it is and what it wants to accomplish. Though the plot was pretty simple and very straight forward (aliens comes in, humans kick their asses) but the thing that made it work is that the plot was very close to the comic books (which exactly what this movie achieved) and the fact that characters were polished and three dimensional.
The visuals and the art direction was very enjoyable and an amazing food for imagination. Action was breath taking and at parts very inventive. The antagonist of the film Loki was intimidating and interesting.
Overall, great story, great script, great characters, great visuals and action. This movie achieved almost everything it wanted - a good comic book movie about the Avengers. Check it out",7
"Sep 24, 2012","This was a very nice movie for one and only reason. All those heroes from the action movies are all in one It's really to much to handle! The plot had some twists too although it was nothing we hadn't seen before. I enjoyed some humorous scenes too and also the conflict of the different characters in the group like iron man and captain america. To sum up this movie is a very entertaining superhero movie, one of the best out there although it doesn't have that something to trully make it legendary!",8
"Sep 20, 2012","Brilliant mix of story, humour and action. Superheros the way they should be for all the family. Not as dark and nasty as recent batman movies. Not as soap opera as spiderman.",9
"Sep 17, 2012",Avengers is the BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER!,9
"Sep 12, 2012","I usually give points for trying. I am not sure who tried to make this movie good, except critics and varied audiences. Extremely jerky plotline, at times it seems like I am watching a commercial for seven upcoming movies. In no way do any of the cast, save for Downey, represent what I would call acting. Johanssen is awkward to look at, seemingly too chubby to look viable as any sort of action actress, and again tends to float in and out of her lines. Hemsworth/Thor gives a good turn, yet he just isn't given much to work with. It is like watching a bad soap opera for teenage boys. Too silly and too cheesy to sit longer than a half hour through. I wanted to like this, set aside time and can pretty much say it falls flat.",1
"Sep 11, 2012","Ok, the start was really slow and boring for me, some part were good, the acting was good, but it's just the actors seemed to made me board in this film but i did like them when they were in there own movies, most of the movie is on a ship, they is not much set changes in this film, the actor who plays the hulk was replaced by a bad actor. just this movie was very bad, i watched it like 10 times and as much as I've tried to like it i just don't like it",10
"Sep 7, 2012","Excellent film, perfect in every way for me. It is definitely as cool as you think it's going to be seeing as Joss Whedon has an obvious love for all of these characters and a understanding of what each of them special.  It's a long old movie too, around 2.30 hours which gives you plenty of story but also plenty of action. The action is very special too, amazing effects and an inventive way of displaying the action. The characters are fleshed out as much as they need to be, but the main focus here is action action action, lovely. Whedon's probably the best thing about Hollywood at the moment.",10
"Sep 1, 2012",Joss Whedon creates a fun blockbuster with a huge ensemble cast that most directors would screw up. Not a great film but it sure is fun for it's 2 and a half hour running time.,7
"Sep 1, 2012","An incredible **** characters are Iron Man,Hulk,Thor,Captain America,Black Widow and Nick Fury.Featuring Loki.Incredible visual effects.Good movie.I liked the journey to Germany.",10
"Aug 30, 2012","Very good movie.
Cons:  The flying fortress should be what it's name says, a FORTRESS which is impregnable!!! That said, it did not shoot a single round in a whole movie AND they let a rouge aircraft approach it (radar anyone, code 7 alert?), shoot at it and blow it's engine!!!",9
"Aug 28, 2012","It's good, even great, when you first watch until you watch it a second and third time and realize that there simply isn't any replay value in it. It's an enjoyable movie, the comedy works because the cast works with their natural chemistry. I just don't hold it in that high regard because it doesn't do anything to warrant the high praise.",6
"Aug 28, 2012","The Avengers: A messy film that does little to appeal to the non pre-existing comic fans. Struggles to fit a coherent narrative between the action scenes.

While action is pretty, The Avengers never seems to quite know what to do with so many main characters.  Making huge assumptions that the viewer already knows each character's arc, they bypass any arc entirely and just have them fighting a lot.

Even Transformers 3, a movie I found very messy and tough to watch, manages to have a pretty coherent and linear story, that just tries to do a few things too many.  But The Avengers seems to decide to leave behind linearity and a character arcs, and just let chaos happen.

The best Marvel film for me is still Iron Man, as it plays with strong character arcs, a progressive and interesting plot, with a sense of 'realistic' special effects and the 'super hero' notion is dialled down a bit.

If you want super hero movies with a plot, try Batman Begins, The Watchmen Director's Cut, and to a more minimal extent Superman 2: Donner Cut.",5
"Aug 27, 2012","Very good action sequences and had more character development than the previous installments...
However of all the recent, undeserved films getting a 2 pt. treatment this feels like one that definitely deserved it and would have been very beneficial.
I felt as if they started to develop a plot - about the team being manipulated - then left it.
Maybe in the sequel.",7
"Aug 24, 2012","It IS a good movie if you're a Marvel fan, but otherwise there's not much to it. The ""story"" is as simple as it gets and the action scenes are so big and so frequent that it fails to impress after a while. It's all about explosions and one-liners and superheroes beating up bad guys, and if that's enough for you... well, great. For me it isn't.",5
"Aug 23, 2012","The only time I review movies on this site is when I see a spectacular movie. But this one just blew me away. Previously only watched Iron Man and Hulk I didn't know what else to expect apart from a mechanical suit and an angry gamma radiated monster. With the addition of 4 other superb characters it turned Avengers into a superb showpiece. The directing was appropriate for the given task and gave audience the feeling that you're part of this mission to save the world. Special effects and action makes this ANOTHER one of those superhero movies, but is it really worth the hype. It certainly is and the box office proves it too.",9
"Aug 22, 2012","Style, substance, and a f**k ton of ass-slamming action, the Avengers delivers. If you don't like superhero movies, or have been let down by previous marvel/dc efforts, then you may be skeptical or biased, but the talents of Whedon and co. were truly harnessed to produce a mass amorphus of brilliance. Being a skeptic myself, and listening to mixed reviews, it look me a long time to come around and give this a go, but this film surpassed my low expectations and didn't just raise the bar for action, style, comedic intercession and witty screenplay, it blasted the aforementioned into the fourth dimension!!",10
"Aug 21, 2012","This movie was amazing, anyone giving it less than a 5 is completely tasteless.  This was exactly what it was supposed to be.  A funny, action packed, special effect, comic book, nerdgasm.  The story line was just enough to keep the storyline boys interested, it makes great use of the previous story lines well.  It makes sure to stay true to the root of all the heros.",8
"Aug 19, 2012","I really liked The Avengers, the comedy mixed with the action made it a great movie, however I didn't like how Black Widow was part of it, she just stood there in that circle with her little skimpy outfit and little pistol while you see the rest of the avengers standing there looking powerful, as if she was just there for show. I'd definitely pay to watch The Hulk smash Loki into the ground multiple times again though.",9
"Aug 19, 2012","THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME! Great story, action, drama, I was engrossed from the beginning to the end! It had some great comedy in it and RDJ was in pure form. I'm glad I paid to see this one!",9
"Aug 17, 2012",The best superhero movie ever made! The acting is top notch and the  story is fantastic. Joss Whedon did an excellent job. It's hard to express how completely awesome this movie is.,10
"Aug 16, 2012","Maybe the most hyped movie ever, considering the 4 or 5 movies that started the journey. Overall The Avengers delivers. One of the biggest question marks going in was how do you put this many characters in a film and keep the story cohesive. At no point during this movie did I feel that a character was being used in a negative way. The story flowed naturally and the dialogue was fun and light. The action looked amazing faithful to the characters and most importantly entertaining. This is the best pure summer popcorn movie to come along in a while.",7
"Aug 14, 2012","fun, enjoyable and entertaining. Do I have to say any more?
If you are willing to see an amusing movie, you won't regret seeing The Avengers, and thats it, The Avengers is an awesome movie.",10
"Aug 12, 2012",This movie is the mix of all the hero that we like but in my opinion they focus on iron man which is good because i like the iron man and in this movie we now know about the hawk eye and other from S.H.I.E.L.D Which help those four heroes protect the earth  the scene in movie that i like is the fighting scene in new york which start from black widow then moving to the  iron man flying to Captain America and then  hawk eye and Hulk and Thor that really cool if we talk about Thor i want him to show more power in this movie too. He\'s god man he has a huge power to fight those Loki\'s army that all i can tell you this movie is awesome,10
"Aug 10, 2012","While the action scenes are breath-taking, Whedon has trouble juggling the litany of characters ingrained in the story, leaving it, overall, thinly plotted and surprisingly predictable.",7
"Aug 7, 2012","Amazing, this movie was by far one of my favorite super hero movies, even though the plot was a little basic, the relationship between Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and the Hulk was awesome. It's not like any of them were left out either, they all served a purpose, they all were in it just as much as everyone else. The Avengers was everything I had hoped for, an awesome funny actionpacked blockbuster movie that will stand the test of time. Joss Whedon who cowrote toy story was set to direct this and I have to say he did a fantastic job. The action scenes were amazing, the acting was off the charts and this was just great. An outstanding movie.",9
"Aug 6, 2012","The review of a marvel ultimate movie ""The Avengers"", This movie was freaking amazing! Joss Weldon did an awesome job on this movie! This was my fav!!",9
"Aug 4, 2012",Awesome Film!!!! Held a great amount of imagination and excitement that you don't see all the time. Had a lot of laughs more than I expected for an action movie. Met higher than the expectations I had. Gathering wonderful characters and a terrific story plot.,10
"Aug 4, 2012","Great movie, it's nice to have six movies (2 iron mans, 2 hulks, thor and capt. america) leading up to it, it will be fun to sit down and them all again , I hope Joss Whedon comes back for a couple more of these, it beats making amazing tv shows that get cancelled way to soon (looking at you fire fly, and dollhouse)",8
"Aug 1, 2012","Great movie.  Funny, good action, good effects.  Ruffalo surpassed Bana and Norton in the role of the Hulk.  A good conclusion to the first saga of Marvel movies, and makes me wanting more and more.",9
"Jul 31, 2012","This film is every little boy's dream: All your favorite Marvel superheros coming together. For the most part, it works very well. The characters have distinct personalities and are a lot of fun to watch, especially when it comes to settling their differences. This is one of those movies that is more about action than drama. There are a lot of scenarios that look like they were taken directly from a comic book, and for a move that's based on a comic book, it adds a great sense of authenticity. Is there anything I don't like about this film? There are quite a few things that prevent it from being perfect, but there are so many moments where you cheer for you favorite heroes that any flaws you come across quickly become irrelevant. In other words, you find yourself in such a huge world of action fantasies that it manages to distract you from everything else. The Avengers is simply an ensemble like no other.",9
"Jul 27, 2012","The best superhero movie ever? Not even close. Do NOT believe the hype with this film, it is simply a lot of hot air. Poor acting - check - there are a few brief moments mainly by Eric Banner
Poorly paced - check - unbelievably clunky beginning then into CGI battle after CGI battle - yawn.
Poor dialogue - check - this is my biggest annoyance. Whedon is meant to be great at dialogue. Where did it go so wrong here? Well this little line sums it up - whats the plan of attack? i have a plan. attack. Yeah its that cheesy. Some people are trying to defend the title of it being a mindless popcorn flick by trying to see things that are not there. This happens in any film where it really is as shallow as it looks. There are some nice glances between characters but it is all so contrived and unrealistic its hard to feel anything for it. When the characters are over being spoilt brats there is the coming together period which is meant to be one of the key character moments in an otherwise disappointing display. It's fair to say it falls short, again feeling contrived and unconvincing. DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE - this film is poor, at absolute best its around 4/10. I am giving it a 1/10 for a number of reasons. 1 - the number of 10/10 is ridiculous not many films deserve 10/10 and this film certainly does not. 2 - the hype lead me to believe this film would be incredible, its not, this caused great disappointment for me. As other top critics have said this film is shallow and a fun popcorn flick. If you like comic books then its almost certainly for you. If however you like intelligent film making with well developed characters which is well paced - go watch something else.",0
"Jul 25, 2012","Avengers is for dumb people, or those that want to be entertained by a bunch of nonsense. We should ask more from Hollywood then the same retreads just on a larger scale.",0
"Jul 25, 2012","This movie right here.  One of the best experiences I've had in a movie theater.  The dialogue was witty and the characters very well-written.  Joss Whedon did a phenomenal job.  As far as movies go, this was one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen.  Though far more than just action, once it gets going, it is so good.  The action-packed final 30 minutes are some of the best sequences I've seen on film.  The Avengers, to me, is the new gold standard for comic book movies.  It doesn't get much better than this.",10
"Jul 24, 2012","Joss Whedon a thespian of the TV world directs his first big budget studio backed super hero movie bringing together some of the most iconic Super Heroes of the Marvel Comics universe.  In my personal opinion the movie falls short of the promise it held with the recently successful Iron-Man, Thor and Captain America who all come together as The Avengers a special task force",5
"Jul 22, 2012","I just watched what was one of the single greatest movies I have ever seen. The Avengers is THE best superhero movie I have EVER seen. I am just stunned. That movie was SO worth the wait. ""Hulk... SMASH!""

It is going to be so hard for any other movie released this summer to top The Avengers let a lone any superhero movie that will ever be released from this point on. The Avengers has completely raised the bar. That was a hell of a way to kick of The Summer Blockbuster Season Marvel! Bravo Marvel, bravo!

For those of you who have not yet seen Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger but want to go see The Avengers this weekend, you could technically see it without seing the other movies but you will just end up hurting your enjoyment of the movie. One of the best things about The Avengers is seeing all of these amazing characters, each with there own standalone film, come together in this truly epic movie. Do yourself a favor and check those 5 movies before rushing off to go see The Avengers. It will be SO worth it in the end.",10
"Jul 21, 2012","The story was horrid in this movie, it felt very lazy. There was never any inclination that the good guys could lose, or even injured; it made for a very flat, anticlimactic story. That's my biggest gripe, but not my only one. Even knowing the backstory of all the characters from previous movies, I just really didn't care about any of them in this one. The characters were written poorly and it was just compounded by the bad acting. Every scene that had Scarlett Johanson in it was painful to watch. The only character I was even remotely interested in was Bruce Banner / Hulk. This would be a great movie to take an 8 year old to. They would have no problem glazing over the shallow characters and lethargic plot.",0
"Jul 21, 2012","Generic and predictable plot. Some characters like Black Widow and Hawkeye were uneeded. Although, it does have some nice and expensive special effects and okay action scenes.",6
"Jul 21, 2012","Explosions and gags... Wrestlemania is better in this fields... Avengers is the worst movie of superheros of the history, because dont have story. Only Downey Jr. brings some emocion, all the rest are littles and poors.",0
"Jul 21, 2012",Very bad movie. It's like i was watching transformers.... My favorite marvel movie is x-men first class... this avengers is not good at all. I hope iron man 3 be better!,10
"Jul 21, 2012","This movie was a lot of talking, mainly just arguing between the Avengers.  The Antagonist is nothing to fear, and there is no doubt in the viewer's head that he will be defeated with ease.  The gigantically long and redundant battle scene against the monster things wasn't special because every alien thing was the same and there was nothing special about them.  Robert Downey, Jr. was the best part of the movie.  His portrayal of Tony Stark was great and humorous.  Captain America was boring and annoying at times.  I don't understand the hype at all.  It was ""all right"" at best.",5
"Jul 21, 2012","Literally greatest comic book movie to date.  And this is even having watched The Dark Knight Rises just last night to solidify my claim.  A movie that never loses it's sense of heroes and the act of heroism is just as glorious as it is sacrificial.  It is something to be cheered, not something to be mourned.  A superhero film that actually follows the essence of a comic book instead of cower away from it in fear of fantasy.",10
"Jul 21, 2012","Ok. Firstly, I've got to say that I had a good time watching The Avengers. There were some interesting moments and liners that even I still remember up to now. Robert Downey Jr. did well as Tony Stark/Ironman and I seriously can't imagine that character is played by another actor. Mark Ruffalo also stole the show. From the beginning until some moments before the ending you could witness how tense he was. He seemed to think that as if he was a nuke that could just blow out at anytime. In short, in term of the characters, I think that there was no flaws at all. The characters were delivered superbly.
However, just like most superhero movies, I found out that I actually don't care about the faith of each character. I had already known that every single main character would survive the day even before I started watching it. As a result, I felt no personal feelings toward the characters. I wasn't afraid that by the end of the movie Ironman would probably die nor I couldn't care less about Hawkeye and Black Widow's relationship. Apart from Bruce Banner character, I felt that I wasn't attached to the characters. They were all flat. And the way I see it, there is always a minus point in watching a movie that you know that the major characters will just survive: There is no tension. I ain't commenting on the story since this movie is not for the hardcore audience;this one is aimed into family teritory. Thus, the flaws in the story and the 'too-much-focus-on-the-effects-is all fine.
I recommend this movie to those who want to have a good time. Prepare some food and watch it with your family. You'll surely have a good time.",7
"Jul 20, 2012","A very fun film, I enjoyed it a LOT. I can't express in words how fun it was. It's great, not much to really say... ummm except that maybe it will be pretty outdated in 20 years... This is the Batman 89 of Marvel. It's a very conventional team action movie but a very well made film as well.

"Jul 19, 2012","Probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen. Only Tony Stark and Bruce Banner seemed developed. The storyline was dull and boring. The finale took forever. The ""come together"" moment was completely terrible. Hawkeye barely got any screen time. Unoriginal storyline creates a power rangers for adults. Mindless action that had no meaning makes this one of the worst Marvel movies of all time. The only good parts about this were the special effects (which had no meaning because of the terrible script, unoriginal storyline, and mediocre acting) and the only developed character, the Hulk. If you want a real movie, skip ""Marvel's The Avengers"".",0
"Jul 17, 2012","Joss Whedon certainly delivers. This is crucial, because this is where five different films intersect. None of the heroes outshine their teammates the fight scenes are eye-candy, and the witty dialogue and humor will satisfy both comic book nerds and average movie-goes alike.",9
"Jul 17, 2012","The long awaited The Avengers seeks out summer movie boredom and punches it in the face with humor, incredible talk-about-it-for-hours-later-with-your-teenage-friends action, and an infectious sense of fun. The visuals are spectacular, the characters are all given their shot at the spotlight, Joss Whedon proves to be a go-to director for big hollywood releases, and, well, basically it just defines the word 'awesome'. It doesn't really unearth any hidden truths about morality and justice (as opposed to other superhero films like The Dark Knight) and you pretty much will see every twist coming, but that is all blown away with its sheer grand scale and fanboy glee-filled moments. Go in with whatever expectations you have and you will probably leave happily. A perfect summer release and an overall great time at the movies.",8
"Jul 17, 2012","With every superhero movie there has to be spectacle, its just a given. The fighting, the actors, everything has to be visually stunning. The problem with superhero movies is that a director (or even to an extent a writer) can get so wrapped up in making the film surprising in its aesthetics that it fails to give the film the emotional resonance you can find all too easily in the comics these characters come from. Luckily for anyone thinking about going to see the Avengers (who are we kidding, most of you are) Joss Whedon (Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Firefly/Serenity) understands the characters he is directing. He understands what makes them tick, why they fight, who they are as people and as heroes. The writing (by Whedon and Zak Penn) is equal parts powerful and hilarious allowing for levity in a story filled with impeding doom. The story isn't overly complicated to follow and the film never loses momentum (even at its gigantic run time of 2 hours and 25 minutes) keeping you entertained for the entire run. The reintroduction of the key cast members is well paced while introducing some much needed personality to characters that failed to receive any in their own origins movies (Captain America, I'm looking at you). Don't get me wrong, the movie isn't all talking. Over half of the film is action (as you would expect) but the action never feels shoehorned in like it did in Iron Man 2 or The Incredible Hulk. The incredible set pieces look fantastic thanks to some undeniably imaginative direction by Whedon who puts the 220 million dollar budget to good use with some incredibly clever shots, especially towards the end of the film.  The film is smart, funny, beautiful and services every single Avenger, including some of the until now overlooked ones such as Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye (who up until this point has had literally one line in Thor) and Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury. That being said, the characters you are going to go see the movie for are still the same dynamic leads you remember them to be from Robert Downey Jr's genius playboy Tony Stark to Chris Hemsworth's arrogant yet loveable Thor. It's not just the best superhero movie of the year (of which we can expect many like the new Spiderman and The Dark Knight Rises), its the best superhero movie ever, and this is coming from someone who thinks the world of Batman Begins. It's not only worth a watch, its worth several. However if you are going to go and see it, check out the cheaper and much more striking 2D version as the film is much brighter and undeniably more vivid. Enjoy.",10
"Jul 17, 2012","The best super hero movie I've yet seen and a damn fine action flick with some genuine humor and touches of heart, a must see.

I can well understand the complaints as to the story it's not Shakespeare but does anyone expect it to be? It's story suits it perfectly however and had me at least wanting to see even if I already guessed what would happen next. A must see.",10
"Jul 16, 2012",Best big action film I've seen in a long long time. They did really well give all the main characters enough air time so to speak with Mark Ruffalo stealing the show as the Hulk. The only negatives for me was the loose story of Thor returning to earth easily through Odin even though in the end of Thor,9
"Jul 15, 2012","The Avengers strikes you like Thor's thunder and will knock you over as if you were Hulk smashed! Bringing together some of the most iconic comic book characters from Marvel, this movie could either be very good or very bad. Fortunately, it's very very good! Using familiar faces like Downey Jr as Iron man and Chris Hemsworth as Thor, The Avengers also welcomes Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk! The movie answers everything you questioned at the end of the Marvel movies and puts you in the middle of the Marvel movies and The Avengers!",9
"Jul 14, 2012","This movie.  This movie right here.  Iron Man being awesome will be more than enough to entertain you.  Personally, I was apparently the only one who thought Hulk was BY FAR the best part of this film.  I felt like they just nailed it with that character both as Bruce and the Hulk.  We've already seen Iron Man but this was the first really good Hulk.  There were points where I actually clapped out of sheer excitement and joy, and I never react like that to a film.  On that basis alone I'm giving this a 10.  It may not have the best plot.  It may be a bit cheesy.  Some of the characters feel like a waste of time.  But I have NEVER had that positive an experience in a theater.  Therefore, ALL THE POINTS.",10
"Jul 13, 2012","This Movie was awesome It has Action,Laughs,Epicness the only thing It didn´t have Its love
This is an orgasm for all MARVEL fan really
And at the and after the credits we can see cleary tha there are gonig to be a 2cnd part",10
"Jul 12, 2012",This movie was very tasteless. There was not much of a story and when it started getting good it went right back down. I think it is just too many superheros for one movie. Many questions that came up for the things that just made nosense.,4
"Jul 12, 2012","The special effects were great and the action was great, but The Avengers was lacking in other areas. The story was ridiculous and not engaging whatsoever and the jokes just weren't very funny at all. God, Robert Downey Jr. annoyed me so much!",5
"Jul 11, 2012","While there is no doubt that Avengers (Assemble here in Ireland) is light on any real plot, that would be missing the real strength of the movie - it's pure popcorn fun. Leave complexity and darkness to Batman, here the characters are larger than life, the action scenes are gripping and the plot is just there to link scenes together (and sometimes not even that).

Much like a Star Wars or Ghostbusters its the characters and the way that they interact with each other that carry everything along, be it in dialogue or in the set-pieces. Yes, the bad guys are pretty much non-entities and the Tesseract is the very definition of a McGuffin but that doesn't take away from a fantastic event movie. By far the best of the marvel movies.",9
"Jul 9, 2012","5 out of 10, even though that's going against the general opinion of the public. It was a really good movie, but it was still a Superhero movie that comes at the tail end of an ongoing fad in Hollywood. I enjoyed it, so don't misunderstand what I'm saying. It just needed to step up it's game in order to compete with some of the other movies that are circulating out there. A lot of people loved it, but I'm not a lot of people. It had it's moments of well done special effects, humor, and dialogue. I was hoping for better, but it didn't meet my expectations.",5
"Jul 8, 2012","The greatest Marvel film of all time. ""Marvels: The Avengers"" has set the bar for all superhero movies of the future. Not only was the acting very spectacular, ( Especially Mr. Robert Downy Jr. ) but the visual effects made you feel like you were part of the story. Alas, the story was not much. It was an average story that should have been overlooked throughout more months. Otherwise, this movie is phenomenal and anybody saying otherwise does not have any taste in movies. That being said i cannot wait for ""Marvels: The Avengers 2""",9
"Jul 4, 2012","Joss Whedon deserves a huge pat on the back for pulling off the near impossible. He has directed and helped create a movie that is a sequel to five other movies. He has brought together all those main characters from those movies as well as effectively dealing with new ones brought into this movie for the first time. Did I mention that this is a comic book movie? The Avengers may be the best movie of the summer and possibly of all year. An exciting story as well as one of the best scripts I have ever seen adds to the superb special effects and the top notch directing. But this movie would be nothing without such a dedicated cast of actors and actresses.          The Avengers does many things right. One of my favorite things about this movie, however, is how each of Earth",10
"Jul 4, 2012","Probably one of THE best Marvel film out there. This film has everything a Marvel fan or any Action fan has and even more! The writing is superb and it doesn't make 1 superhero above everyone else, all of them are equal even the lesser ones like Hawkeye and Black Widow, heck even Nick Fury. Unfortunately this film is plagued with a fault every other Marvel film has; pacing. I feel that the middle-point of the film was very boring and it was just talkin and talkin also the attack on the flying ship was pretty lame too, there wasn't much spectacle except when Banner Hulks out. Which comes to my next point, holy sht the last fight is pretty intense and literally redeems all of the flaws I have with this film. So I'll give it a 9/10. If it wasn't for the epic climax I'd probably rate it a 6/10 or 7/10.",9
"Jul 3, 2012",Where are the attractive actresses? Are they all locked in rich peoples basements? Why can't an attractive female be in movies? Your review must be at least 150 characters long.,6
"Jul 3, 2012","Josh Whedon brought out the best in every character. Sharing the screen time between the group of heroes and playing them off each other with a master's touch. There were no wasted moments are dead-end story threads as found in most comic movies. The villains and threat lived up to the use of the group of heroes. They all got their time in the spotlight. This is the best Marvel film to date, and by far the best use of the Hulk.",9
"Jun 28, 2012","A great example of the whole being worth more than the sum of it's parts.  Out of all the individual movies, the IronMan series is very good , with the others falling short of it's mark.  Now with The Avengers, they can all be thought of as pretty good opening scenes to one heck of an ending!",9
"Jun 28, 2012","The Avengers is a great film, and really shows off the iconic Marvel superhero team. It has a quite long running time which is great because it allowed more detail than if it were shorter. Aswell as the action that we all knew it would contain, the film also contained some light humour and a few dramatic scenes which made this such a good film that everyone should enjoy. In conclusion, it has got to easily be one of the best films of the year, and I am sure that other people would agree with me.",10
"Jun 26, 2012","Perspective: A fan of Avengers comics and cartoons for decades. Loved almost every Marvel movie to date

Expectations: Been waiting on an Avengers movie since Iron Man, totally blown away by the trailers

Delivery: Speaking as a fan of the original source material, Avengers totally blew me away. The ultimate experience for fans of the comics AND movies. Seeing these all of these characters interact (and fight) with one another is rewarding on so many levels. I was a highly volatile mixture bubbling over with geeky excitement for the entire film. For those who don't read comics but enjoyed the Marvel films, Avengers takes all that you loved about those previous movies (action, humor, and a good story) combines them and sprinkles them generously throughout the entire experience. For the artsy types, this is an fx laden superhero action adventure movie, so don't go in expecting to see Shakespeare with laser beams, or Citizen Kane with a cape

Avengers is easily the best movie of the Summer (so far), and easily my favorite super hero movie ever PERIOD.",10
"Jun 26, 2012","The special effects alone are not enough to make a good movie, but apparently not many people understand it. Often boring, rarely funny and exciting. Only look if you love Marvel.",5
"Jun 25, 2012","Everything about this movie is slick and classy, from the dialogue to the action sequences (which I must also say are 10 times better than in other action films I have seen throughout the years). The plotline is actually sophisticated (praise the lord!) and therefore the movie doesn't need to treat the viewers like dummies (seriously, could I ask for anything more?) Particularly impressive is how well the film integrates the various stories regarding the different superheroes into one cohesive, kickass unit. And I mustn't forget that the film is fun. You'll have a blast watching it. It's entertainment at it's best. Did I mention the film is fun? Wait until after the credits for another scene that will make your viewing experience even better.",7
"Jun 23, 2012","This is an action film- and nobody likes action films with not enough action. I went to this movie of the normal opinion I go to see action movies with- I'll have seen all the action in the trailer. This is absolutely not the case with Avengers! I was pleasantly surprised with the fact there was far more action than your average superhero movie film, with not too many less-interesting talky talky bits. I gave this a seven because though the effects and acting were astounding, I felt it could have used a bit more explanation of the storyline, and was a bit slow to get going. Some stuff I just didn't get as well. But besides that, good job! Definitely better than a lot of the things I've seen in the cinema of late (cough john carter cough)",7

"Jun 21, 2012","Here are 5 reasons why this movie wasn't as good as it could have been:
**** actor playing the villain was too weak for the rest of the cast of characters.
2. Too much of the movie takes place on a Plane
3. That's 3 strikes now for casting a decent HULK actor, or even scripting a good HULK storyline
4. Robert Downey Jr.'s shtick is getting tired and repetitive (see: every movie he makes)
5. Thor is a super-powerful God, what is it that the other characters have to offer? (maybe they are the distractions)",5

"Jun 18, 2012","Stunning movie! Thumbs up to Mr Whedon and Mr Marvel who know how to put together a blockbuster, and for all you marvel followers who have seen this movie brace your self, the best is yet to come.",0
"Jun 15, 2012",Felt like I actually got my moneys worth for a change with this movie.  I saw it twice.  Pure entertainment.    It is comic book style.  Of course this movie was not going to break literary ground.  O took my kids and wife to this movie and we laughed the whole way home.  What more can you expect from a piece of fiction?,10
"Jun 15, 2012","It's finally arrived - the blockbuster to end all blockbusters. So, is it any good? In short, yes it is. Over the last four years, Marvel has delivered a series of mostly underwhelming origin films that seemed to spend as much time setting up The Avengers as they did introducing the hero on the poster. Incredibly, Mr Whedon has managed to bring together all the Marvel big-hitters, played by some seriously big personalities, and somehow make it work as one film, with every character equally serviced and  their place amongst this all-star roster well-earned. The highlight of the impressive cast is definitely Mark Ruffalo, playing the latest incarnation of Bruce Banner/The Hulk (though he's the first actor to truly play both sides of the character with the assistance of motion-capture). Whedon appears to truly understand the character, and Ruffalo is able to effectively communicate to the viewer through a sensitive and understated performance the extreme fear, paranoia and depression of Bruce Banner, and by really letting rip in his mo-cap suit he demonstrates the volatility and terrifying power of ""the other guy"". Robert Downey, Jr.'s wisecracking playboy Tony Stark/Iron Man continues to entertain, and Whedon gives Downey the very best lines in the film - my personal favourite being when Stark is trying to reign in the furious new arrival Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and mocks his flowing red cloak with ""doth your mother know you weareth her ****?"". Scarlett Johansson also easily manages to hold her own in a largely testosterone-fuelled cast, and manages to develop Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow from the stereotypical sexy femme fatale we saw in Iron Man 2 to a fully-rounded, deadly and viciously intelligent character tormented by her violent past that we see here. The final act shows the true potential of a modern big-budget superhero film; with the six heroes working together to defend Manhattan from an alien invasion lead by the increasingly manic tyrannical Asgardian exile Loki (Tom Hiddleston). In one particularly slick and visually eye-popping moment the camera snakes its way through the city and in one unbroken shot takes in each of the Avengers in turn working as a team to repel the invaders. The most rewarding and enjoyable moments for me, however, were on a far smaller scale and from much earlier in the film. In one particularly fine scene from the first act, Black Widow travels to Calcutta to persuade reclusive Bruce Banner to join SHIELD forces as a consultant on gamma radiation, and the on-edge scientist feigns a transformation into his greener side to test Romanoff's true intentions. I also loved Black Widow's interrogation of Loki later in the film - the scene gives Johansson and Hiddleston plenty of room to play off each other and it's intelligently scripted, brilliantly tense and beautifully performed by the actors, resulting in an incredibly revealing moment for both of their characters. The Avengers is exactly what a great blockbuster should be - grounded enough to be relevant and dramatically effective in the contemporary world (with references to worldwide energy shortages, WMDs and the terrifying future of warfare) but also fantastical enough to be fun, and to provide a level of escapism for the audience (it is about a group of very special guys and gals in funny costumes fighting aliens, after all!). I must admit, the film does lose momentum a couple of times, and there are some incredibly convenient plot devices employed firstly to get the heroes together, and secondly to tie things up towards the end, but you can't really hold these minor gripes against a filmmaker like Joss Whedon. This is a man who has achieved the impossible in making Marvel's crowning glory worthy of the time and effort dedicated to laying its groundwork over the last half-decade, and with the addition of his trademark playful sense of humour, the film doesn't look like it's taking itself too seriously, which could have been fatal. Awesome is a criminally misapplied adjective in this day and age, but there really is no better way to describe this super-powered extravaganza. Unless Hulktastic is a word, that is.",8
"Jun 12, 2012","Now, I'll be honest with all of you. I wasn't really interested in watching this movie when it came out. But my friends invited me to come watch it so I tagged along, and was I glad I did. The movie was great, it was funny, but I will be honest, I felt the sorta middle of the movie was very boring, in fact I ended up falling asleep for a couple minutes because of it. Anyways I did enjoy this movie towards the end, and I didn't expect the movie to actually be funny, I thought it was going to be a serious and aggressive movie, but I was wrong. I enjoyed this movie and I do recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good movie, and a good laugh!",8
"Jun 12, 2012","This is THE MOVIE OF THE YEAR! This movie had all the best heroes in it, and it shows how well Marvel can do a collaboration with The Avengers. This is a movies for the whole family.",10
"Jun 12, 2012","Hell yeah! If that was not your first thought when the movie was over you are a total idiot. This movie was completely amazing. They story was great and entertaining. There are way too many scenes in this movie that were great to even pick a favorite. The movie has a perfect humor to action ratio. All the actors were brilliant and played their roles perfectly. And Scarlet Johanson was so sexy as The Black Widow. Best superhero movie yet, I don't know how they will be able to beat it with The Avengers 2. Not loving this movie should be a crime. Anyone who didn't like this movie has terrible taste in movies and should never watch another movie in their life.",10
"Jun 11, 2012","I'm not a big fan of comic books and have never read any of the Avengers comics, or anything by Marvel actually.  All that aside, this is a great film that has plenty of action and humour.  I thought all the main actors did a good job with what time they had on screen, but obviously with so many characters some get less screen time and therefore less development.  But I didn't feel bringing the different characters from their own respective films felt forced at all!  My personal favourite is probably Captain America which is a total surprise - but Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man is also brilliant.  Even more of a surprise, this film made me like the Hulk!!  Saw it twice, and hope Marvel Studios will keep making more of these, with quality writers and directors!",10
"Jun 11, 2012",This movie is OK. good action but it miss something to merge all parts in one big thing. the solo movie of the heroes was better for me at least. The movie is a bit to long by the end. $6 is good investment for 2 hours of action movie,5
"Jun 11, 2012",The action is almost as hardcore as Transformers and the story just as good as Iron Man. Its an unforgettably fun comic book film. You simply can't go wrong with 6 heros for the price of one.,10
"Jun 10, 2012","To sum it up into a few words The Avengers is a fun movie. Don't go in expecting something that will blow you away and leave you speechless. It's funny, the characters mix well for the most part, and the action is good. To be honest I would be giving this movie a lower score if it weren't for the egg head combo, and the nice pockets of humor. Definitely a movie to see, but if you have something else to do watch this later.",7
"Jun 10, 2012","It is not good, but it isn't bad either. I don't like how according to the film no one died during the attack on New York. This film is nearly ruined because of that. I really do like Captain America though. I don't think that Chris Hemsworth is any good at playing Thor. I don't get the praise for the film, but maybe that's because I don't care about the comics and don't give a damn if every moment is filled with some fan boy's dream. Look, all I want is a good film.",4
"Jun 9, 2012","BEST **** HERO MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
But bad choice of a villian.",9
"Jun 9, 2012","Horrible film.

Absolutely no content whatsoever. There is not a shred of seriousness of genuine emotion or action in this movie.

Any attempt to create any sense of connection is broken up by stupid one liners, which continuously add to the shallow and unrealistic characters who couldn't really be farther from acting like superheroes.

The plot is likewise very badly done.   It felt like they tried to make the movie go forward just so they can show the meaningless 10-15 action scene where the ""heroes"" get together and kick ass.",3
"Jun 9, 2012","The movie was very well written, and very good quality, however I did feel that the movie had too much fantasy, and too much special effects. Overall The movie is a GO!",7
"Jun 9, 2012","Excellent film. Acting is brilliant. The middle section is a bit slow, however the ending makes up for it. Go see this film. Then go and watch the other Marvel films. Then watch this film again.",8
"Jun 8, 2012","This movie isn't what it's all cracked up to be. I honestly didn't like it. The effects and what not was amazing but, the plot in general and the acting kind of pissed me off. But, In some cases I actually liked it.",5
"Jun 8, 2012","The Avengers is a action packed, fun filled movie. The move does not dissapoint with the special effects the 3D is good, but the movie is great with or without 3D but the 3D is good. The movie is full of fightng, explosions and humour.",10
"Jun 8, 2012","This is almost a great film. Almost. The action sequences are pretty amazing, for so many super heros all in one film it hangs together very well, and there are a couple of genuinely funny lines and moments of drama.  but it's still popcorn and the plot relies on unbelievable moments (even for super heros) and some annoying things like the hulks new found self-control. but, bearing in mind how trite capn america was, and the expensive but kinda unfulfilling thor... this coud have been rubbish, but is I reckon the second-best recent mainstream super hero movie, coming in behind the dark knight.",8
"Jun 6, 2012","Iron Man changed my expectations about how good superhero movies can be, still, I wasn't planning on watching  this. However, with people making so much hype about  I headed to the theater. The Avengers strongest element is it's action, all the battle scenes are great and are well paced. And the SPFX are spectacular to watch. As for the directing, you wont be disappointed as long as your not a cinephile. The cast performance are nothing special, I much rather see Mark Ruffalo  in Shutter Island.",8
"Jun 6, 2012","This movie wasnÂ´t of my totally pleasantness, fools jokes, boring and spent  history, but i wasn't like! i don't like! is a stupid movie. I only save the special effects",5
"Jun 4, 2012","Was almost certainly going to struggle to live up to the hype that's surrounded it, but this was great fun, if a little slow to start. There were a couple of plot points I didn't quite get, but well worth seeing.",7
"Jun 4, 2012","I've been a fan of movies my whole life and I really love good movies.  I love comic book heroes especially Superman and Batman.  I really hated the Batman TV show growing up because I wanted a serious take on the character.  I was so happy when Batman Begins came out because I finally got what I knew a comic book movie could be a serious dramatic endeavor and it still had its humorous touches too.  BUT it was NOT campy.  Then when ""The Dark Knight"" came out I was blown away because it truly was what I had been yearning for since I was 8 or 9 years old when I first saw the campy batman tv show you know with all the kapows and whamos they could throw in it.  I don't know much about ""Iron Man"" or ""The Avengers"" comic books.  I have never really gotten into reading comic books even as a kid I didn't read them.  But when ""Iron Man"" came out I said this looks cool I have to check this movie out.  And wow what an awesome surprise it was.  Another great comic book movie in the same year.  I own ""Iron Man"" and ""The Dark Knight"" on blu-ray that is how much I love the first ""Iron Man"" and ""The Dark Knight"".  And I thought to myself it has finally happened we have passed into special effects nirvana where hollywood can now literally put anything they can dream up onto celluloid and it will look as if it truly exists.  So now I'll finally get to see all the comic book movies turned into great movies.  Well, then ""Iron Man 2"" came out and pretty much quashed the dream I had envisioned.  Marvel went back to the batman tv show campy style and that style **** I hate it.  They had a chance to truly turn Iron Man into a great live action franchise and they screwed it up.  And then I heard about ""The Avengers"" coming out and being released all over the world before it was released in the states.  And anytime a studio does this it is so they can get the maximum return on their investment before its state side release because they know they did a decent movie but they know its just a decent movie and not a great one.  I still wanted to see it though to see if they would steer back onto the correct course set in the original ""Iron Man"" and they gave a very valiant effort BUT after seeing the movie I came away feeling, ""Eh ok I saw it but it doesn't really matter that I saw it.""  When I left the theater after seeing ""Iron Man 1"" I wanted to know where I could get an Iron Man suit.  They could have made ""The Avengers"" make me feel that way when I left the theater but they figured oh well as long as its good enough the rest of the world will go see so it doesn't matter that we stop the action so the characters can exchange dialogue several times in key action sequences.  The dialogue wasn't woven into the fight scene.  They broke my #1 rule of movies don't make feel as though I'm watching a movie make feel as though the events are actually happening.  Please don't think I'm not well versed in the movies I have seen them all and rank them in the following order (best to worst):  Iron Man 1, Captain America, Thor, Both Hulks, Iron Man 2, The Avengers.",5
"Jun 3, 2012","I expected something entertaining yet, cliche filled. I thought it was going to be as bad as Captain America or Thor, but SURPRISE! my mind was blown by the effects, incredible story, hilarious jokes and flawless digital effects. The movie itself is without any doubts, a master piece",10
"Jun 3, 2012","loved the action coool and of course the comedy bit in film with thor and stark which really made me laugh and hulk part which i entirely laugh what he did to thor which crack me up....


good film i wait for blu ray movie did not find the captain america actor he was not good i did not find him to be all super hero or nothing just he thru that garbage lid to hurt his bad guys


but rest of film was good",10
"Jun 3, 2012","This was the worst movie I have seen this year. I generally do not like comic book super hero films but this one really was dreadful. The plot was stupid, the acting was stupid, the aliens were stupid, the street scenes were stupid, and I was stupid for going. Captain America, give me a break! Why did Ruffalo and Renner appear in this piece of garbage? This is what audience crave? Thor and his hammer! God, I was sick to my stomach.",1
"Jun 3, 2012","The 3-D Is Amazing And Epic!
We Want Somthing New Not Another Freaking Superhero Movie...
THINK",4
"Jun 2, 2012","After finally watching The Avengers I can report that its brilliant. It lives up to the hype and then some. Even the dialogue scenes are fun with great comedy that actually suits the characters. There is real emotion to the story, the action scenes are brilliant and I thought the 3D worked well. Show stealer for me had to be ""The Hulk"" with some great scenes and even a true LMAO one liner. A must see movie, but I think you need to see all the other Marvel movies first to truely appreciate this.",9
"Jun 2, 2012","The awesome **** of explosions, jokes and badassery. Expertly directed, no heroes are deprived of screen time, each one has his own unique story. Mark Ruffalo's got a great debut as the Hulk, Robert Downey Jr. being even more funny and sarcastic than in the Iron Man movies, and Captain America doesn't annoy me as he usually does. (I don't like the character in general) There are some flaws though - Black Widow and Hawkeye feel a bit out of place (Pistols against armored aliens? That's only acceptable because of Johansson's body) and Loki just doesn't appeal to me as the main villain, especially the second time in a row. (after Thor)
Overall, I'd say this movie is a bit overrated (With lots of fanboys screaming it's ""the best movie ever""), but it is actually the exemplary superhero movie, exciting to watch and easy to forget.",8
"Jun 2, 2012","Harboring a great deal of expectation of this record-breaking multi-superhero-in-a-row action mash-up, I finally caught up the last chance to watch it on the big screen, but unfortunately the film has indomitably become my very first disappointment in 2012.  Alerted by the general opinion of â",5
"Jun 1, 2012",The movie was fantastic!  I like Marvel characters but somehow I wasn't into The Avengers growing up so I was only mildly excited for this film.  It blew my expectations out of the water though.  The Hulk was definitely the best part of the movie but everyone held their own.  Can't wait for the sequel!,10
"May 31, 2012","Any time that your tentpole, super-powered geekfest, CGI extravaganza'd, mega-blockbuster PG-13 moviefilm's antagonist can utter, ""...THAT is my bargain, you mewling quim!"" - your movie is probably made by Joss Whedon. This film is, and thank my various deities for that. ""The Avengers"" DELIVERS.",10
"May 31, 2012","The Avengers is the best superhero movie ever made.  It is that simple and I have a guilty pleasure for the genre.  I was a little annoyed when I got the forced set ups of this movie in Iron Man, Thor and Captain America but now I appreciate them.  I even see an uncredited Hawk in a scene in Thor now.  Awesome special effects, though this does not have to be seen in 3D.  It's fine without 3D.  If you like comics or action movies, you will like this.  Not every popular movie is bad.",10
"May 31, 2012","well , i had nothing to say about this film ,
because this film was...................
awesome !
impressive !!
and funny !!!
i love the part where hulk smash loki !

BEST SUMMER MOVIE EVER IN 2012 !",10
"May 29, 2012","Before I saw the movie, I thought it was going to be a stupid combination of a bunch of bad movies in an attempt to create on good movie.
I was wrong.
Lets face it, the only one of the avengers with a good individual movie was Captain America. But all together, they made an awesome movie. Teens and adults will love this movie. See the movie immediately. Intense action, combined with Scarlett Johansson in skin tight clothes, makes what could be the best movie of 2012.",9
"May 29, 2012","depending on what you are looking for you will either love this movie or like me be left sitting in the theater with a look of obvious disinterest. think of it this way, if you are a twelve year old boy you will fall in love with this movies big explosions and cheap easy comic lines. you can see the obvious struggle of creating this movie in the way of properly incorporating all of these large characters into one small movie (however not short). it was from a real quality of film standpoint not good at all. the whole plot just seemed to be there to accommodate the characters and then shove the one big climactic real action scene in at the end. its not the best superhero movie ever made but if you want something that is mildly interesting, and throws witty lines and explosions at your face as if you where not an actual real person then this would be a great movie for you.",5
"May 29, 2012","The Avengers gives the super hero movie world as a whole a much needed dose of ""good"" rather than the ""meh"" and ""huh?"" of recent offerings. Now it is a great movie, no doubt, but it can't stand on its own without the previous hero movies wich ranged from serviceable to bad. On its own, Avengers doesn't offer much in the long term like Titanic or Avatar which have enoyed long standing value since their stories are self contained and much more focussed on the characters. Avengers assumes you know half of what has already happenned and the plot provides little exposition for anything that has occured in previous movies. So despite the lack of lasting appeal, The Avengers is still well written, action packed and fun enough to be worth admission.",8
"May 29, 2012","A fun, action packed romp that finally pulls together all the little trailers at the end of the credits in past Marvel character movies.  The main action sequence near the end went on about 20 minutes too long for me.   Other than that, it was fun.   Probably won't be really clear to you unless you've seen some or all of the preceding movies. Worth the $8.",7
"May 29, 2012","The super best action movie ever which collaborated all best comic hero together in one. Seen forward for the second part to be more super and addition of more heroes.
Compared to DC, Marvels are best of the Best ever.",10
"May 28, 2012","This movie is pretty good even if your not a comic book fan. The story's plot is that Loki tries to become ruler of earth and uses the cube to do it. The acting is great, the camera shots are amazing, and the attention to detail is great. The way the play the roles of the hero's, villains, and even shield is great because they capture the personality of the comic book characters. They even throw in a few comedy in the movie so it doesn't feel like a non-stop action movie. If you know who the people are chances are that you'll enjoy the movie, but if you are lost you probably wont enjoy this movie",8
"May 28, 2012","This movie would have been a perfect 10 if the editing had been better. It was well written, funny, action packed. Everything that it needed to be. I loved it for the most part. But there are certain parts of the movie that really just didnt need to be there. It forced it to drag on too long at points and made me kinda just wanna get to the end.",8
"May 28, 2012","This movie is NOT an apology for the somewhat disappointing Captain America. It is just the next installment in the MARVEL Cinematic Universe that happens to have great line after great line, great performance after great performance, great hell of a wallop after great kick in the face, and it just happens to be all packed in a kickass, 2 hour movie that is excellent in EVERY way. Even if youâ",8
"May 28, 2012","Great action, effects, plot, actors...EVERYTHING!! The film blended all the great features from the other Marvel films and created something unique and wonderful.

And great humour :) love the character interaction- especially Tony Stark/ iron man/ loki XD It was a really great film, and i applaude all those involved in its making :)",10
"May 28, 2012",This is a GREAT movie and you do not want to miss it. I thought it might be a little corny but it wasn't at all and Marvel did a great job bringing all the characters together with their distinct personalities. The action was amazing and so was the comedy. One of my most favorite all time.,9
"May 28, 2012","One of the best (if not THE best) comic book film ever.

It is a summer film wih good humor, great special effects and a plot that doesn't get in the way of either. For comic fans: Loki is done very well, Iron Man gets most of the attention and the Hulk certainly become a favorite by the end of the film. Thor is probably the least fleshed out.

Overall it is a great film and as the Dsiney execs  have already stated, ""There will be a lot more of the Avengers in the future...""",10
"May 28, 2012","There was nothing in this movie that I didn't like, from beginning to ending. If you're a fan of Marvel movies, you will not be disappointed. You can definitely trust the USER'S review average on this one! The only minor remark I have is that I saw it in 3D, and I think at times it was pretty dark. I would've preferred the 2D, but it was not available in cinemas near me.",9
"May 27, 2012","I'm a Long time Whedon fan who was BORED BEYOND BELIEF.  Can't believe the most commercially successful thing he's ever done is far-and-away his worst - oh, the irony.  ""Avengers"" focused on everything that **** about super-hero movies - absurd plot based on dumbest-ever world-threatening McGuffin, stupid villain, convenient-not-clever heroics.  I don't hate the genre - I liked ""Iron Man"" and even ""Capt America.""  But from the opening action sequence on, I just didn't care one iota about anything that was happening.  Contemplated walking out after about 45 minutes and wish I had as it's an ENDLESS MOVIE and I'll never get those 2.5 hours back.  I give Joss points for giving little girls someone to root for by making Black Widow a substantial member of the team and not the mere token chick.  That there are about 3 good jokes, but none are worth the time and money.  If you love Joss, watch Serenity again it's 10 thousand times better.",0
"May 27, 2012","A very enjoyable movie with great actors and a great combination of super heroes! Action is great, humor as well. This movie is definitely worth watching!",10
"May 27, 2012","Thrilling action sequences, a rideable (if simplistic) plot, compelling characters and easily the funniest quips and one-liners ever featured in an action movie. It's unbelievable the extent to which this movie has lived up to (and even surpassed) the unabashed hype train that's been building up since 2008's Iron Man. Anyone who doesn't like this film is either lying or depressed, friendless f*cks. This is, simply put, the best superhero movie of all time. ""What's that?"" :O ""Better than The Dark Knight?"" OF COURSE NOT YOU IGNORANT F*CKS. But Batman isn't really a superhero, he's just a well-trained, resourceful, intelligent motherf*cker with an intimidating voice and costume. Far from the over-the-top-abandon-all-pretense-of-realism characters of Thor, Hulk or Iron Man. This film deserves all the praise it gets and then some, a true...MARVEL (*Badum-Tsh*)",10
"May 27, 2012","I think this was my very first movie I watched in 2012 and I gotta say, I liked it. My initial concerns were about how the movie would live up to this enormous hype it had already built up and how Joss Whedon, a director I have never even heard of, would develop the personalities of multiple characters the movie has. Surprisingly enough, he exceeded my expectations in a good way. The story and dialogue was created with full blown Hollywood style treatment, but it was witty, enjoyable, and had a solid point. The character development was also strong, something that most directors cannot handle due to the fact that making 7 superheroes individually stand out is pretty difficult. But hey, Joss Whedon did it, so I give huge credit and respect for it. Anyways, long words short, in my opinion this was a good summer blockbuster, keeping constant of it's premise and living up to the hype. Recommended watching.",7
"May 27, 2012","The build up and hype for this movie was definitely worth it. It's one of those movies you'll be replaying over and over in your head, reciting some familiar lines with friends, and be dying to see again after you leave the theater.  I enjoyed the build up a lot actually and the not-so-action-packed scenes, as they allowed you to get reacquainted with each character, their story, and their personality. Seeing the collection of actors interact with one another also provides some really cool moments as well, and they all meshed together quite nicely. Every hero in this movie gets multiple moments to shine, which I absolutely loved, and there's some brilliant comedic moments mixed in with the action to keep you thoroughly entertained. I thought Samuel Jackson's lines could have been better written at times, as well as Chris Evan's and Cobie Smulders', but for the most part, I came away saying that it was definitely worth seeing in theaters.  The Hulk and Iron Man especially steal the show in this one... and not to give too much away here, but fans of the show ""How I Met Your Mother"" may also really like this film too, as a couple references (not sure if they were intentional or not, but then again, Cobie Smulders is in this) to the show are made.",10
"May 26, 2012","All the pieces of the Marvel film puzzle have finally been assembled, and the outcome was... fairly satisfying. It has all the thrills and flares needed for the first blockbuster of the summer and its packed with a lot of humor and cynicism that keeps things light. The visuals and sound designs were dynamic; and action sequences bombastic, but the icing on the cake were the characters that were brought to life (once again) for the big screen; Captain America, Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and the Agents. They were unique, dynamic, and director Joss Whedon did a good job at offering them equitable screen presence. None of them got lost in the mix. But the standout was surely Mark Ruffalo's take on Hulk, which exceeds the 2 previous versions by a land slide. Despite all the fun action and smart humor, the film was fairly empty. Our heroes weren't faced with any serious struggles or personal demons, they only had to kick the butts of those who wish to 'Take over the World'! And that wasn't a hard task for them. All that I saw in this movie was the same formula, redone in a (slightly) more charismatic way. Overall its an entertaining popcorn flick...which should be seen for the summer, but don't expect to take away much from it.",6
"May 26, 2012",The best Marvel film so far.  great action and funny.  They are doing a great job with The Hulk bringing him into the fold as a real super hero rather then just running amuck.,9
"May 26, 2012",A great film to enjoy with the family and even has some decent character development that I didn't expect in this size of a cast.  Robert Downing Jr. steals the show as his character is much more develop over the course of the Marvel movies.  I would highly recommended this film to anyone to see more than once.  Something I haven't done since the release of The Matrix.,10
"May 26, 2012","Best Marvel film to date. Doesn't try to be a deep dark and serious film. It's humorous, camp, shiny and brilliant. One of the few films that is packed with action and has a good plot.
Definitely watch this film especially if you watched and enjoyed the other Avenger films (Iron Man 1&2, Thor, Incredible Hulk, Cap.America)",10
"May 26, 2012","The Avengers, a smart and very entertaining movie.
Could be the best Marvel Studios movie, in my opinion: it is.
The humor, action, effects, music are excellent.
I thank Joss Whedon make a movie as epic as this. It is just as good as the Dark Knight? No, you need a little to reach the Nolan film. The story is good but not a big deal, but it is best to entertain you from beginning to end. The best superhero: Iron Man.",8
"May 25, 2012","The Avengers is one of the best Action films of all time.  The story is solid, with a healthy mix of action and humor.  The only people who wouldn't like this are people who don't like outrageous mindless action on the screen.  The thing with action movies is, you go to see just that, and adding a solid, yet not over the top story with GREAT characters only makes the package even more complete.  Humor tends to fill most of the gaps where action doesn't exist, and this film is worth your time if you're even remotely a fan of action films.  Only thing I felt was off about the movie was the fact that some of the scenes didn't make enough sense in transition from one to the other (one of them quite blatant, you would probably recognize it after you watched it), easily to overlook though.  Watch this movie, just do it!",9
"May 25, 2012","An overall great film. Amazing special effects, well fleshed-out characters, good dialouge, and aside from a couple slow spots, it has action from beginning to end.",10
"May 25, 2012","I was looking forward to this film in a big way.Well its hard not to when your A,a comic/superhero fan, B,An action movie fan & C,Been following the buildup to this film in the form of the Iron Man,Thor,Captain America & to a lesser degree The Hulk movies.I was confident this was gonna be a good movie,because of the cast,director,the other movies & from what i saw of the movie itself during production.Well,i certainly wasnt disappointed!.. Of course it takes a while to build up to the big action,but theres plenty to keep you interested until then,from the buildup itself,to the characters & their dialog.This movie does exactly what it set out to do as far as i'm concerned,& its hard to imagine it done much better.I feel Stark/Iron Man & The Hulk Stole the show a bit(especially Iron Man).A Highly entertaining movie which i highly recommended,especially if you like your action or Superhero movies.",9
"May 25, 2012","The Avengers was a pretty terrific movie. Good job by the Iron Man and Hulk not only in comedy but also in action. The trailer created much anticipation and the movie did well. Indians really really liked the movie.
I had to force my other pals to go see the movie. The only bad part that half of the shows in India were dubbed so not much of the effect there on the people. Otherwise. Hats off Tony Stark and Hulk..!!",9
"May 25, 2012","The Avengers smashed a hugh number of things by which I would say it's entertaining and full of actions. With all the big stars, amazing special effects, great action scenes, this is the kind of movie you want to spend your money on. However, I must say I don't think it was fast-paced enough for the part where the Avengers were recruited. I checked my watch a few times during that part.",9
"May 25, 2012","This is a great movie!  Go see it, you won't regret it.  It's pretty amazing given all the different characters coming together here that everything flows naturally.",9
"May 25, 2012","Awesome. The action, humor, effects are all there. A well developed storyline, characters. The special effects in this movie, JUST AWESOME!! I mean look at the helicarrier, it looks realistic and futuristic at the same time. I am waiting for a sequel, The Avengers have amazed me. Its a MUST WATCH!!!",10
"May 24, 2012",this movie is so bland and overrated. honestly i'm still dumbfounded by the fact this movie has garnered good reviews. dont get me wrong. it's not a bad movie but its not as good as everyone think it is. Yes its super cool with a team of superheroes saving the earth but thats pretty much it. the dialogue and script of the movie is so bad. seriously. at times while watching the movie i laughed so hard at the script not becos its hillarious its because of the poor script. very cliche and predictable storyline. The action was not bad. and there are too many plotholes. when we watch a superhero movie we have to defy logic and just enjoy the 2 hours ride but i just cant for this movie. there are so many illogical and unwarranted events. The best marvel film so far is probly iron man without a doubt and maybe the incredible hulk. rober downey jr was at his brilliant best. mark ruffalo does a not bad impersonation of the hulk. the rest are very mediocre. honestly i didnt expect much from this movie. cos u cant expect a top class movie with multiple superheros. but i was quite excited to watch it like i said  a team of superheroes. who wouldnt? but i guess blockbuster movies are like that. just hoping the dark knight rises and the amazing spiderman would be epic!,5
"May 24, 2012","Overall the movie was very good.  The visual effects were amazing, the cast did a great job, and the movie achieved the ultimate goal of any movie, to entertain.  But, I think it's been slightly overrated by a large chunk of people calling it the best superhero movie ever, when I think The Dark Knight still holds that title.  There are just a few moments were it seemed the plot was kinda stretched to the limits, like when Tony Stark figures out that Loki is at the top of Stark Tower based on absolutely nothing.  Then there are the several awkward dialogue moments like when Cap. America says, ""The last time I was in Germany and I saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing.""  This line literally made me cringe.  But, hey, it's funny, its cool, and its got like 6 superheroes in one movie so its definitely worth seeing.",7
"May 24, 2012","Efectos espectaculares y actuaciones decentes, fue lo unico que pude percebir en esta pelicula, ya que no maneja un guion con buenos argumentos, pues para empezar, Â¿cual es realmente la relacion entre Loki y el ejercito extraterrestre?, es una de las cosas que nunca logre comprender. Las actuaciones son lo mas destacable, Mark Ruffalo hizo un gran trabajo interpretando a Bruce Banner, siempre dando una sensacion de humildad por parte de este personaje, eso hasta que se tranforma en Hulk. Thor, interpretado por Chris Hemsworth, finalmente le dio un toque mas maduro al personaje, justo como en los comics. Chris Evans nunca de los nunca me termino de convencer como el Capitan America, es un personaje que le queda GIGANTESCO, pero observe una mejora a comparacion de la pelÃcula del personaje. Y creo que no hace falta decirlo, Robert Downey Jr. es brillante como Tony Stark. Yo les pongo un 8, esta puede ser la mejor pelÃcula de Super heroes por el momento, hicieron un buen trabajo en el especto de las actuaciones, le toco a cada uno su pedacito de pan, osea, su momento de robar camara. Altamente recomendable, 143 minutos que vas a disfrutar.",8
"May 24, 2012","I listened to everyone who raved about this movie and I was so disappointed. Boring with a capital B; I could generally anticipate everything that they were going to do, say, or have a big noise to surprize the audience. Even the visual effects was so predictable and the dialogue was straight out of Screenwriting 101.  If you must see it, rent it on DVD so you can fast forward through all the endless exposition of people talking you to death.",0
"May 24, 2012",A great movie with good characters and special effects but the drama in the middle of the movie is tedious. The movie could be more epic if Spiderman and the Fantasic Four join in the fun since they are Marvel characters.,7
"May 24, 2012",This movie is insane. Best movie I've seen this year. It's a sick action movie and even has some small comedy parts just for laughs. It's a must for anyone who has been a fan of all the other comic book movies or someone looking for a sick action movie.,9
"May 24, 2012","This movie is a great action flick with a few emotional scenes thrown in for good measure.  Everything about this movie exudes perfection.  Sure, some of the plot makes no logical or practical sense, and sure, some of the casting does not match previous movies featuring the same characters, but dammit, I don't care!

The length of the movie is about 2.5 hours, yet the entire movie seemed to just fly by.  After the movie was over, I was shocked that it was already close to midnight.  Overall, I just could not get enough of this film.  I plan to buy the Blu-Ray/DVD combo once they release it, and I will definitely watch the movie over and over again!",10
"May 24, 2012","Why THE AVENGERS could easily become a huge success? I think even some of you could answer thiz question. Thiz movie is the culmination of Marvel hard work over the past couple of years. The lucky guy who was appointed to direct thiz movie is Joss Whedon. The director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) initiates the Avengers initiative by assembling all the super humans to save the world from the powerful evil Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The storyline is not as dynamic as I think it is, there was a time when the story is stuck and filled with unnecessary dialogue. The power of thiz movie obviously lies in its character interactions. Nick Fury is originally written as a white guy in the comic book but Samuel L. Jackson confidently steps in to play thiz character. Thiz is not the first time thiz has happened. It reminds me when Michael Clarke Duncan portrayed the overweight crime boss Kingpin in Ben Affleck DAREDEVIL (2003) and I am also so excited to see Laurence Fishburne as Clark Kent boss Perry White in upcoming Superman MAN OF STEEL (2013). However, in thiz case, I did not see Samuel L. Jackson became Nick Fury, instead it was Nick Fury became Samuel L. Jackson. But in the end, it was totally acceptable. Samuel L. Jackson is able to present a precise leadership aura to his Nick Fury character. Once again, I have to remind you, what made thiz movie so interesting is when these superheroes gather around and interact with each other. We can see The Duo Chris, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth who successfully demonstrate their muscular bodies, just like in CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER (2011) and THOR (2011). Thiz is how superheroes should look like! The brand new figures in thiz movie are the master archer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and the elegant Agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders who is widely known in HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER {2005-present}). The other figures who have been introduced since IRON MAN 2 are the loyal Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) and the sexy heroine Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Surprisingly, Scarlett Johansson has a fairly large part in thiz movie. Wait a minute, on second thought, if you have Scar Jo in tight sexy latex suit, of course you will exploit it more. If we are talking about Iron Man, thiz is also one of the most interesting parts. It looks like Robert Downey Jr. have already fused into thiz Tony Stark character so deep, he can represent thiz self-centered character very well without any problem. But in thiz movie, the one who really becomes a scene stealer is the giant green rage monster named Hulk! Once again, it was the Hulk character, not exactly Dr. Bruce Banner or Mark Ruffalo but it was all of them in one. Some fresh and funny moments are obviously when Hulk is around. The most unfortunate thing is that they did not bring up the original founding team such as Ant-Man and The Wasp into the movie. In the end, I confidently can say Marvel Comics seems to be one step ahead from its competitor DC Comics so far. Recently, thiz movie has ruled the box office chart and it turns out to be the earth mightiest blockbuster movie. You know what that means, right? Oh yeah, the next Avengers movie will be coming soon. Maybe next time Marvel Studios will enrich their universe with the presence of other superheroes like Quicksilver, Black Panther, Vision, Doctor Strange, She-Hulk, Wolverine, even Spider-Man. Are you ready for another one?

"May 23, 2012","Quite possibly my favorite movie of all time. It has everything a good nerdy superhero movie needs and tells a tale that is quite unlike anything we've seen in theaters before with film heroes of 4 different film series coming together. Action was superb especially toward the major final showdown. Acting is fantastic(Mark Ruffalo and the Hulk are quite loveable and you wont miss Ed Norton TOO much.)

Though the threat isn't incredibly frightening it provides just enough danger for the plot to seem real and significant enough to justify this great meeting of heroes...

Stick around til after ALL the credits as there's TWO secret endings(although the first is decidedly more important than the second). Go have fun...this is the summer romp well worth the 4 year wait and should prove to the rest of Hollywood what a summer Blockbuster should be like.",10
"May 23, 2012",A very risky movie to make considering the abundance of heroes. It could have used more information about the army of other-worldly creatures so willing to invade another planet. Looking forward to the inevitable sequel.,9
"May 23, 2012","The movie was actually much better than anticipated.
I didn't expect the story to go around 1 character and it didn't.
Joss Whedon did a good job at bringing the cast together to deliver a great story.
All I wish now is if he could add a bit more action sequence into the film and make it slightly more intense to improve the movie.",8
"May 23, 2012","Despite being billed as an action movie, The Avengers is painfully slow. Much of the plot involves the eponymous team fighting each other, though we all know going in that they will eventually team-up, so this lengthy attempt at conflict seems especially sluggish and misdirected. Robert Downey Jr. And Samuel L. Jackson both manage to pull focus and remind you you're watching a bad movie more than they usually do,  which is saying something; and the cast is generally much too aware they are in a movie for it to work. Indeed, The Avengers is so remarkably unambitious they even manage to avoid developing some of the team's most notable members like The Scarlet Witch and The Vision, choices that would be mystifying if it wasn't so clearly a cynically half-hearted attempt at storytelling. Nevertheless, Chris Evans is still nice to look at.",2
"May 23, 2012","As you can see by the overwhelmingly positive reviews, this movie is hardcore nerd pornography. I now have insight into the fanboy mind: Screen make flashy flashy boom boom I clappy my handsies if u don't like u just a h8r. But the special effects really do give this thing a great-looking outer shell. Kinda reminds me of a pretty Easter egg that you can't wait to open but is disappointingly filled with those black jelly beans everybody hates. I liked Downey Jr. and non-Hulk Ruffalo. Scarlet played a robot with an accent. Captain America dude and Thor just plain can't act. They're so bad, they're almost a parody of themselves. Put them on SNL. They won't have to change a thing. Stereotypical one-dimensional GOOD guy vs. stereotypical one-dimensional EVIL guy + one-liner + insanely long stretch of movie in which nothing at all happens + evil guy beats up good guy for a while + one-liner + good guy shows evil guy what's up = you still go back to your girlfriendless lives, nerds.",5
"May 22, 2012",Would I rather a return to the great action adventures of decades ago based on semi original concepts? Of course. But I'll take this over the mindless crap thats out there right now any day. Avengers is funnier than literally every comedy Hollywood farts out these days then add a few insightful character scenes and some cool if not breezy action sequences. Really my only gripe here is how undramatic this thing was. Theres just nothing at stake. Sure the whole world is being fought for but we know who wins. Thor takes a thumb tack to the side. Everyone else comes out the war unscratched and they all eat some shwarma. I guess its more of a comedy than I even thought.,8
"May 22, 2012","I didn't like most of the prequels to The Avengers, I didn't like Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America. So I was pleasantly surprised by The Avengers which is quite better. It is however a movie that I would never like to see again. It is awesome the first time, but there is nothing left once it's over. The sole value of the movie lies in its action scenes, and sometimes fun, sometimes not fun jokes here an there. So switch your brain off and enjoy, the entertainment is guaranteed. Once you've seen the action, you've seen all there is to see, and there is no point whatsoever to come back again to it. There is (as usual, sigh) some rubbish science talk that doesn't mean much and that shows how empty the plot is, so why bother including it at all? The movie could have been a bit shorter without it and without some other minor scenes, the action would have been more intense and the movie could only have been better. Anyway, I enjoyed it a lot, I didn't regret going to the cinema for once.",6
"May 21, 2012","If it weren't for the great special effects and a few guilty pleasures, ""The Avengers"" would be a complete snooze-fest. A generally solid cast as well as the 3D imagery were woefully underutilized. For all the film's frenetic energy, there was little in the characters and the plot for the viewer to invest emotionally.  In short, the sum was less than its parts in this overlong spectacle from Joss Whedon.",5
"May 21, 2012","What can I say. This movie pulled out all the stops. I find it hard, and sometimes clichÃ to rate something a 10, but this film deserved it from start to finish. With an opening that pulled you in, to an ending that left you wanting more, this film deserves the 10 it is receiving.",10
"May 21, 2012","This is a fun, epic superhero movie. If you watch this movie in theater, you'll absolutely have a blast. For a full review, search up the user ""TNShowbiz"" on YouTube, and check out my review on The Avengers.",8
"May 21, 2012","This Movie has spoiled so many people because everything else looks like crap now. I was existed to watch the New Batman movie coming out but i couldn't care less about it now. I just hope this doesn't downgrade the single hero movies coming out like the next iron man or captain America. Lots of people talk about how grate Hulk was in the movie and now that i finally seen the movie i know what they're talking about , he was amazing. Thanks to the ""GODS"" characters in the movie Hulk didn't have to hold back like in the other Hulk movies but , I have to say my favorite with out a doubt was Thor !!!!  Just like Hulk Thor wasn't pulling punches. He went full god mode in this movie. **** epic !!!  OK so if their is one thing i didn't like was how Black widow was doing more then Captain America. I think she kicked more ass and had more camera time then they Captain America. I also liked the captain America suit he had in his own movie. The suit with the brown boots. It felt better then the suit he has now. They could have made it out of heavy leather and less bright. Other then that it was perfect , 9.5 out on 10 is my score",9
"May 21, 2012","I liked it a lot.  My wife found it to be a bit slow at the beginning, and I could totally see that for someone who is not a big fan of the genre.  To me it was just the prerequisite build up to the action that did not disappoint.  The story can be criticized for its lack of depth, but lets face it, you are not going to ""The Avengers"" to quibble over the story.  The Hulk took a while to make an entrance, but when he did, I found him to be the best part of the movie.  Overall, this was a great movie.  Anyone who complains is either not a fan, or just one of those internet contrarians who find it fashionable to hate things others like.",9
"May 21, 2012","How can people say terrible things about this movie?  I know there are flaws in the film.  But most of the problems are created by hipsters of critics who want to seem cool but instead, end up looking like **** who don't  even know what the f*ck they're talking about.  The film is an exciting roller coaster ride from start to finish.  And when there isn't action going on, there is either great humor  or fantastically done character development.  There is no reason you shouldn't be going to see this movie.  And anyone who sees Battleship instead of this, is dead to me.",9
"May 21, 2012",Its an ok superficial superhero action/comedy and if you liked movies like Iron Man and Captain America you will probably like this to. It has funny one liners and good looking effects but not much more. If you want a movie with good story and any depth to the characters this is not for you.,6
"May 20, 2012",This kind of movie is for the young at heart and mind. Not that there's anything wrong with that-been there done that-it's just such a repetitive genre. Invincible people beat up on invincible people. No-one gets hurt- major damage to buildings though-and then they do it again. Hulk gets the best scenes and Iron Man gets the best lines. In the end after 1/3 of greater New York City is demolished Mayor Bloomberg (or whoever in the future where Aircraft carriers fly) asks for Stimulus money from.......Odin?,4
"May 20, 2012","Just Brilliant!
The Action scenes are immense, the charakters are cool and interesting... the whole movie is total fun! I love how the different characters interact with each other. The movie doesn't try to be an intelligent Masterpiece but that's good because instead, it's giving you one awesome moment after another for the whole running time of 2 hours! Only a better Story could make this Masterpiece more perfect than it already is. It's very expensive, but I'm going to watch this movie a third time this week!",9
"May 20, 2012","Every hype is fake. The Avengers is not the best Marvel film to date and quite possibly is the worst superhero movie I've seen in terms of humor, history and has no replay value. Loki or Thor never have been ""stars"" in comics. Bad choice for an Avengers movie.",5
"May 19, 2012","UNBELIEVABLE. Best Marvel film to date, hands down!  No, best superhero film of all time!!!  Saw it in 3D and it was just an awesome experience.  So many characters, so much character development, everything done so well.  Fantastic performances by all, what a complete success.  Only few scenes I thought were a bit carried away; these scenes all included the Hulk.  Also the film didn't really explain how Hulk could become a team **** did I miss it?  Despite these flaws, what an incredible and entertaining film - easy 10.  Congratulations Marvel/Disney.  Can't wait to get it on Blu-ray!",10
"May 19, 2012","Absolutely brilliant! The Avengers brings depth to the Marvel characters, provides loads of laughs, great action, unbelievably stunning visual effects, and fantastic performances from the whole cast. I give this 100% **** movie.",10
"May 19, 2012","Easily one of the best superhero-movies ever made! I was worried beforehand the movie would feel like a patchwork, what with there being so many ""lead"" characters. However, after seeing it, I can safely say that's not the case here. All the characters somehow get to have fantastic character-moments that really develop their personalities, something not many blockbuster films of this kind takes its time to do. Mind you, the action is there too, and it doesn't disappoint! Super-well choreographed fights that are easy to follow, and they always showcase the individual heroes powers and strengths superbly.
All in all, if you like superhero movies, or just good adventures, I cannot recommend this film enough!",9
"May 19, 2012","I've always been a fan of Joss Whedon ever since I saw Firefly, a television show of his that was unfortunately canceled. So when I say I liked it, that's not much of a surprise. But I didn't like it just because he directed it. The action was stylish and fun, and it was a whole lot better than one of the previous Marvel comic book movies, Thor. This should be the inspiration for later Marvel movies, along with the new Captain America: The First Avenger. Not only did it have some excellent action scenes, it was also humorous, with a certain level of seriousness. Would I recommend heading to theaters to see it? Well, yeah. But if you're a person that just isn't sure about it, or who maybe isn't a fan of the comics, by all means, rent it from Redbox, Blockbuster, Netflix, or any other movie rental company you go to.",8
"May 19, 2012","It delivers exactly what its promotional material seems to promise, two hours of impressive CG, clever one liners and an always dependable Robert Downey Jr. If there's a weak point, its that Downey carries the rest of the cast single handedly.",9
"May 19, 2012","Best movie I've seen in years. Amazing cast, dialogue was great. Connected all previous movies perfectly, making it seem like a perfect legacy. Truly great",10
"May 19, 2012",Very entertaining movie that was well worth the price of admission and is very much suited for the big screen experience.  I was completely entertained for the duration of the movie (over 2 hours).,9
"May 18, 2012","What works: the allure of Marvel Comic branding, cast and media marketing made 3D event a ""must see"".

What fails: script, cast chemistry and total lack of character development for key roles and length of movie (should have been part 1 of 2). Overall: Not even close to the hype; Catch on DVD.",5
"May 18, 2012",More than delivers.  Given the amount of hype that was to be expected in such an epic adventure of bringing several stories together.  This movie stands for what comic book fans have been imagining their entire lives.  Can't wait to see how they continue and plan to keep the success rolling.,10
"May 18, 2012","I have not been this entertained by a film in quite some time. Whedon didn't make a film, but conducted a symphony of entertainment. Action, humor, banter, dialogue, all worked in seamless harmony. Unaccustomed to such a level of entertainment, I was mesmerized. If time flies when having fun, this movie was exactly that. 2hrs 45mins flew by, with every second as welcome as the first.",10
"May 18, 2012","Best ensemble Super Hero Movie ever! Iron Man and Hulk done great. Thor, Hawkeye done well. Black Widow elite killer assassin tearing up about possibly being torn in half by the Hulk? Not so sure about that.
Biggest and only real disappointment is Chris Evans inability  to fill Caps stature in an ensemble cast. Though he was really good in the cap movie but gets lost in this movie when competing against these other on screen personalities - It doesn't help that they changed caps costume to make him look like he is wearing underoos.",10
"May 18, 2012","Imagine a typical summer blockbusters, explosions and gunshots, mixed with superheroes, and lastly a true good plot. Boom, you got yourselves the Avengers. Solid cast, eyepopping effects and good yet predictable story. Nuff' said.",9
"May 18, 2012","This movie is yet another example of sloppy script writing covered up by special effects, a few good action scene moments and some good gags. I don't know if it's coming from studio involvement but overall the movie is filled with scenes that could have been simplified or written differently but instead were used to shoe horn in a cool special effect or line of dialogue. I walked out of the movie liking it but you couldn't pay me to sit through it again and I'm someone who likes the characters. As a whole you know movies are getting bad when a 80's action movie has a more solid script than the Avengers. If you like seeing people punch things though and cars explode with the occasional funny gag you will probably love this movie, if you want a movie that is more than that stay home.",5
"May 18, 2012","I love this movie! Finally a great movie with my childhood heroes. Do not miss this opportunity, go see this movie now! HULK SMASH! AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!!!!!!",10
"May 18, 2012","Best movie ever! Awesome action, animation, effects and jokes, it is the best compination of actors and superheroes to date. Worth the watch! I really liked it, and there was not a 11 out of 10 score lol.",10
"May 18, 2012",The avengers is an best marvel film i have ever seen. At one point of time i loved the spiderman  parts . But when we see the way the avengers is been taken itz simply amazing. The incredible hulk was one of the most hilarious and most serious of all. However the way hulk beats up the villain is like the people wash clothes!!!!!!!!,10
"May 17, 2012","I WENT TO SEE THE AVENGERS WED, AND HAVE TO SAY I WAS THRILLED TO SEE IT. I WAS EXPECTING MORE ACTION THROUGHOUT THEWHOLE MOVIE,FROM START TO FINSH AND I DIDNT GET **** THAT WAS 1 DOWNER FOR **** CHARACTERS WERE AWSEOME AND SO WERE THE EFFECTS, THE STORYLINE WAS KIND OF LAME.THEIR WERE PARTS THEY TRIED TO MAKE FUNNY AND **** I DID GET MY MONEYS WORTH. I THINK IT NEEDE SOMETHING-LIKE MAYBE WOLVERINE,SPIDERMAN,THEY ARE AVENGERS ALSO...WELL NEWER AVENGERS..I WOULD OF LIKE TO SEE MORE ACTION, MORE SUPER POWER TEAMWORK LIKE IN THE GAME ULTIMATE **** IS A GOOD MOVIE TO TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE AND YOUR WIFE.",8
"May 17, 2012","Waste of money, Plot is horrible, the first 45 mins is absolute junk, I dont know how a movie like this could make so much money. I guess teens might like it cause they bash stuff up and CGI is kewl. Dont waste your money wait till it ends up on TV or dollar rental.",10
"May 17, 2012","It was funny, awesome, and just plain fun. You will enjoy it even if you know nothing about comics. Hulk. Ya? Smash.",10
"May 17, 2012","Cant believe this movie is getting some negative views. Sure its not perfect, but what movie is , especially one as ambitious as this one. I must admit I was skeptical that they would be able to pull a movie off with so many iconic characters. They did and then some. This is a supremely entertaining comic book movie. In my opinion better than the first Iron Man and miles better than the Thor and Captain America movies.  Amazing and a solid 8 out of 10.",10
"May 17, 2012","I had my doubts at first. I was expecting a movie with nothing but random fighting, nothing interesting. The movie had me at the edge of my seat the entire time. The moments of hilarity between sadness and destruction kept the movie well balanced. I loved the bond of all the characters, seeing everyone come together to fight such a force was great. I highly recommend to GO SEE THIS MOVIE. You will surely like it.",10
"May 17, 2012","Well done Joss Whedon and your cast. Awesome movie. Very entertaining to the casual watcher and a nerdgasm for the hardcore fan. Best Marvel Movie so far in my opinion and best superhero, comic book based movie as well. Spiderman WAS my favorite hero movie, but no more.",10
"May 17, 2012","The Avengers was everything i could have asked for and more. The action was awesome, the dialouge was fun, every character had their moment of glory and I walked out of the theather feeling happy beyond all reason. Sure, it's a superhero movie so the plot is pretty simple, but who cares? This movie was just awesome beyond all reason. I'm surprised metacrtic didn't give it a higher rating...",10
"May 17, 2012",Absolutely outstanding! The Avengers is no doubt one of the best films I have ever seen. This movie is packed with action on top of action with all of the most popular superheroes out there. I recommend this film to anyone who is looking to spend their money and get the big bang for their buck.,10
"May 17, 2012",Avengers Assemble! great action flick made better if you've seen the other hero movies and made best if you know comics along with what and who's coming for the next one wow!,9
"May 16, 2012","The Avengers is just flat out fun. Throughout this whole movie, i was entertained. The story, however, was not as great as i would have liked but everything else in the film pretty much makes up for it. Even as a superhero movie, it made me laugh out loud in many situations. It's hilarious. It's action packed. It's amazing. Robert Downey Jr. once again proves that he was made to be Tony Stark. He was great in this movie just like in Iron Man. Even though, I didn't really like Captain America: The First Avenger, Chris Evans was also great in this film. Mark Ruffalo was the big change in this movie. I loved The Incredible Hulk especially because of Edward Norton but I think that Rufallo did pretty good also. Scarlet Johansson was the eyecandy for all the men who went to watch this film and she really fit into the role of Black Widow. Chris Hemsworth as Thor was great, since I did enjoy the Thor film. Samuel L. Jackson really didn't hit me like all the other characters in the beginning but by the end, I was happy he was chosen to play Nick Fury. Overall, The Avengers is one of the greatest superhero movies I have ever seen and definitely the most hilarious.",9
"May 16, 2012","There is a reason why The Avengers is setting box office records, because its an awesome movie.

I am a long time Avengers comic book fan, I even have an Avengers Annual #1 from 1968.

The movies gets a little long winded in the middle as the group comes together.  But when things get rolling, they ""really"" get rolling. In previous Marvel movies the heros have been under utilized.  The Avengers breaks those bonds so that the heros can do their job.",9
"May 16, 2012","I don't get all the hoopla over this film.  In the end, it was yet another superhero movie with the same predictable storyline.  It does have great special effects, good action (although a very shaky camera during the action sequences), and good 3D.  They were smart to feature Iron Man more than the others as he is by far the most interesting of the Super Heroes.  I have to say though, that it gets old that these heroes keep getting beaten to a pulp, then they get up without a scratch on them like a cartoon character.  Ridiculous.  I also thought that the Hulk was not supposed to be lucid when he was in his hulk state, yet at the end of the film he is calm and even says a few words while being a Hulk.  I did look at my watch a couple of times and for me the 2 1/2 hours was excessive, but it was just good, not great.",6
"May 16, 2012","First off, I am 30 years old and grew up reading comics and will still occasionally pick one up if i hear good things. What did I think about the Avengers? I came into the movie with good to great expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Its over 2 hours long and the beginning does lag a bit but the payoff is worth it. This is the pinnacle of what a popcorn movie should be. There's a decent story, good character building, excellent choreography and effects, and just the right amount of attitude and humor. I saw this with a five year old and he loved it. A note of caution concerning younger viewers, there is some blood and the ""bad guys"" can be scary. Overall I highly recommend to anyone who wants to have a good time, just don't go in expecting a masterpiece a la the Godfather.",9
"May 16, 2012","If you didn't see the other 5 movies, go watch them first (even Hulk).  The movie will taunt you with flashbacks to the old movies and you won't get to see the full character development.  Having only been armed with the Iron Man movies, understanding of Norse Mythology, and basic background on the other heroes, I still got  a good understanding of what was going on.  However, the movie had a lot of elements from the other movies, specifically Thor.  The movie's beginning is S.L.O.W, almost as slow as the first Willy Wonka.  I'm not going to spoil the story, but don't worry, you'll forget about it.  It's basically the Marvel formula: Bad thing happens, find hero(es), train, find bad guy, some one dies, attack on New York, save the day, New Yorkers go yay.  As for the characters, it's hit and miss.  Tony Stark and Loki are very enjoyable and witty, Captain America and Bruce Banner are alright, and everyone else is paper thin.  Very little character development happens and by the end, the characters are still the same people.  The final fight scene was as you think it would be.  The effects are well done and the Hulk provides comic relief.  My favorite scene by far was when Hulk was chasing Black Widow, though.  Don't worry about the music, because you won't notice it.  It's drowned out the the amazing amount of dialogue in this movie.  Even in the fight scenes they can't shut up.  There's no suspense whatsoever.  Overall, I was very disappointed, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a good movie.  But, if you want a good superhero experience, just go watch the Dark Knight again.",6
"May 16, 2012","Okay so many critics who are saying bad things about this film is going to far into this film. Joss Whedon did an amazing job with it. Perfect amount of everything you had the suspense, the comedy a perfect balance of effects and action. The film didn't focus one main Avenger it focused on all of them which was great to see. Some of these bad reviews I see that some of these don'y enjoy a good ole action movie. See this movie. Its worth it.",10
"May 16, 2012","This film was probably one of the most funny movies I have seen this year. Also, it was one of the most badass. I say that lightly, but give it the aformentioned status because Joss Whedon was at the helm for this one. Now a word of warning: the film will be confusing to you at first if you have not seen the movies that came before it. Those films set a general framework, so Whedon assumes you know what is going on. This is not a setback, because it saves time having to explain everything. I went to see this film for the Hulk, and I was not disappointed. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man was like revisiting an old friend, as he makes the film less serious which is good. The comedic moments catch you off guard, and help to add to the charm the film has. I was pissed because I had to watch the film in 3D, but the 3D was not horrible. It was adapted at a tolerable framerate that did not give me headaches. If you must watch it in 3D, do not fret. I hope everyone that is a fan of Joss Whedon and superhero films goes to see this movie.",10
"May 16, 2012","Best marvel movie
very nice crosser and the story is good, not just the usual issue with the big boss,
thanks hulk, you rock, sorry, smash!
they are the ultimates!
not 10 'cause tony alone is cooler",9
"May 16, 2012","Really the best movie that use the franchising Marvel, good actors, nice story, some commedy all well mixed.
Maybe 3D it is useless, but i really enjoyed the movie.",9
"May 16, 2012",Everything perfect.Just what I wanted and needed to see.Only have one thing that made feel VERY **** scene were Tony Stark said I'm bringing the party to you and she said ( VERY CORNY AND UNCOMFORTABLE ) I don't see how that's a party.Like she had gas or she forgot her **** i'm just messing. Best movie of the year so far.,10
"May 15, 2012","I have seen this movie 4 times already (don't judge) and it has never gotten old. The action and humor mesh together perfectly in this movie. I did not expect to laugh as much as I did when I first saw the movie. The action is awesome and the special effects are top-notch. If you are a fan of the Hulk like I am, you will be very pleased with this movie. The Hulk steals the show, and people were cheering when he was on the big screen. Every character gets their fair share of screen time, with no one getting left out. I recommend watching Captain America and Thor before seeing The Avengers, because those films will provide helpful background information so you will not be confused on what is going on in the movie.",10
"May 15, 2012","The only thing that stops this movie from getting a 10 is the relatively slow beginning. Though necessary to the development of the characters, it still felt sluggish at times. However, the last hour and a half or so is beyond epic and easily compensates for any flaws the film has. The Hulk stole the show. It may have taken 3 movies with 3 different actors, but Marvel has finally perfected Bruce Banner on the big screen.",9
"May 15, 2012","I would not bother seeing the 3D version of the movie since the 3D aspect was added later and not very well. That being said, this is an amazing movie and I can't wait to see it again. Just don't pay extra for mediocre 3D.",9
"May 15, 2012","Can't remember the last time (never?) I went to a movie on a Monday night and saw a half full theatre of people cheering and laughing at a movie. Despite the positive hype, I cringed when the movie started off with a space scene featuring gods, aliens, magic, and mass-audience-unfriendly terms like ""The Tesseract."" It seriously seemed like all the right ingredients for the perfect train wreck. But it worked, and it worked well; delivering some of the best / most clever scenes ever to appear in a superhero movie. The casting was excellent as well - especially for Bruce Banner - even just standing there, he felt, nerdy, detached and dangerous. (but with just the right amount of soul.) I guess the best compliment I can give The Avengers is that it reminded me why sometimes it's just awesome to go to the movies.",10
"May 15, 2012",This Movie was Awesome times Infinity. Whedon depicted all the characters correctly. I have learned a lesson on here today about how Metacritic works. If its a score of 69 like how Avengers has then I should watch it because I loved this movie.,10
"May 15, 2012","After Thor movie I lost all hope for next awesome comic book based movie, so I wasn't so excited about Avengers... till I saw the movie. Avengers is mix of action, comedy and one of the most popular marvel characters. But there is one problem... story is too cliche. Aliens (extra-dimensional beings) trying to destroy the world and superheroes are going to save it. Nevertheless movie is fun and looks incredible in IMAX. I would certainly give this movie 10 if not the story fail, so it gets 9. Now let's just hope that Dark Knight Rises won't have similar problem.",9
"May 15, 2012","I said I wasn't gonna do it, but I watched 'The Avengers' last night, in glorious 2D. Now for a solid week, fake life-style comic nerds have been building this thing up to me like it was the second coming of Christ. It isn't. Think of it like this. 'Love In The Time Of Cholera' is a far better literary work than a 'Wolverine' comic. They are truly different animals. Using this example, ""Scarface"" is a far better film than ""The Avengers"". I didn't get the impression Joss Whedon was trying to make high cinematic art here, which is fine, if you take it at that level. It's fun. It's mindlessly entertaining, and the effects are top notch, but then they sort of had to be, didn't they? Watch it. Take your kids. They'll love it. Just don't let any Marvel fanboys build up your hopes too high. As comic movies go, it's pretty decent. As a pinnacle of modern filmmaking, it fails all over the place.",5
"May 15, 2012","Digital Money Maker

This is the crash! Bang! Wallop! movie of the year. It's digital, it's funny, it's stupid and it's in 3D -the first must see, post Avatar. Only if you don't know who each character is, or haven't seen their movies, you may be at a loss to follow (as if that matters).

Loki (see Thor) has made a deal to get revenge on Thor and the Earth (of course) by getting some ridiculous source of power to some very bad aliens. All of the Marvel heroes - flawed heroes all - have to first unite, then trounce the invaders. And they do and you know they will.

The script is way above average for this kind of film - think Iron Man witty. The cast is top notch - especially Mark Ruffolo (Hulk), Downey (Iron Man) and the redoubtable Samuel L. Jackson as the team leader (Fury). No doubt, Jackson has replaced Morgan Freeman as the black American god who can do no wrong. The effects are as good as they get, as long as you can focus your eyes. It is often like putting your head in a washing machine with 3D glasses on.

Joss Whedon wrote, directed and probably gave birth to this film all on his own, and he makes a good fist of it. Despite it's enormous length - 147 minutes of popcorn chomping, it keeps your attention and never takes itself too seriously. I only wish that poor Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) will take a serious part next - you know, like in Hurt Locker and the Town - to balance his all action man roles.

This film cost a fortune and will make a fortune. Trust me",8
"May 15, 2012","First of all, the fact that the critics show a score of less than 80 for this film shows that these guys OBVIOUSLY do not know how to enjoy a good film.  They spend so much time complicating knit-picky details in their nerdy little heads that it is IMPOSSIBLE for them to enjoy a TRULY GOOD film.  And the fact that they rated it in the 60s screams a warning to anyone who will listen that SOMEONE needs to take their bongs away from them at least one week prior to going to see ANY movie upon which they will be writing a review.  :",10
"May 15, 2012","I'll keep this short and to the point.  This movie is gratuitous fun.  ...lot's of action, great special effects, a ridiculous plot, and some laughs.  I am one of those people who hates when a movie doesn't take me seriously, especially when it's pretending to.  This one doesn't pretend to, and was entertaining.  This is one extreme of what the cinema was created for, and shame on you for feeling bad about yourself for enjoying it.",8
"May 15, 2012","I've seen this movie 3 times, and I plan on seeing it a 4th.

Nuff said.

P.S. Better action than Michael Bay's films, Funnier than Judd Apatow's films and more heart than most anything in recent memory.

Love You Joss",10
"May 15, 2012","Disappointing.  I can sum it up as 2 hours of explosions and 1 liners. Acting was... mediocre. I honestly expected a lot more. It was more of a straight action movie, the story was very very bland. Only good thing I can say about it was the visual effects were great and that is it.",6
"May 15, 2012","I didn't think I could be invested in so many characters in just one movie. I love the idea that each of the avengers have had there own movies, and that made them more familiar to me for this movie. seeing them together was just amazing. I loved the dialogue between characters and the action. There were a lot of subtle fan service moments that were also accessible to people unfamiliar with the comics. I was never bored because there was always something going on, whether it's a great action sequence or banter between the characters. The Avengers is a movie I can watch now and for many years to come.",10
"May 15, 2012","Marvel's The Avengers is a fun movie. It's a +2hrs ride full of capes, suits and explosions. Just the type of entertainment you expect for the summer. It's not a deep movie, it's rather the opposite. The focus was on the Avengers coming together. While it was cliche usually, I enjoyed it. I knew what to expect, yet I watched it with pleasure. I think that's the point of such movies. You go to the cinema not expecting a masterpiece, but a good funride. We're presented with the obvious mid-movie crisis between the heroes and then the big fight with all of them fighting together. Cliche, but it's still nice to see Hulk alongside Iron Man :)

Whedon and his cast deliver. Most of it, at least.
The movie is stolen by Ruffalo's Hulk. Peroid. He gets the funniest moments, with Thor coming in second. Suprisingly - Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is only trying to be funny. I didn't laugh at any of his jokes and sometimes even felt a bit irritated.
Hiddleston's Loki is believeable, while Evans is a complete and utter mistake. I just can't bring myself to liking this version of Captain America. Evans looks and acts in this movie like a dumbed-down 25 y.o. with muscles bigger than Thor's. Not my pair of shoes.
Renner steals the dumbest scenes in the movie with his funny faces and acting seriously, while doing stupid things. The felt... unnecessary. Both of them, really. Well no. Black Widow served a purpose. As opposed to Cobie Smoulder's Maria Hill. If she was supposed to be the eyecandy, she surely didn't catch my eye.

Other major flaw is the forced 3D. My cinema didn't offer me the choice between 2D and 3D. And I regret that, because I watched about 30% of the movie with glasses off. It doesn't improve the experience, but on the contrary - makes the faster paced fight scenes blurry and hard to watch.

Whedon's humour is clearly visible throughout the whole thing and is a major strength of the movie itself. And again - Hulk steals it. Stark tries to be funny, but on majority of occasions fails.

I left the movie satisfied with the outcome. There were superheroes, big fights, laughs and Johansson in spandex (unfortunately 3D instead of pleasing the male audience did the opposite, blurred everything in closeups :( ).

If you wanted a movie with tons of your beloved comic heroes doing good, you get better. You get a well paced and executed picture, which clearly sets up the ground for sequels. And I, for sure, will be visting a cinema nearby to see it. Just as I will go to Iron Man 3 and Thor 2.

I will not go to Captain America 2, because Chris Evans is NOT my Captain America and at the same time is the biggest flaw of The Avengers. Pity, but we get Hulk, Iron Man and Thor to cover him up. And that's enough for me.

Assemble in a theatre near you and enjoy. As did I.",7
"May 14, 2012","Full of great action and humor.  It keeps a good balance on every hero and doesn't favor any over another.  From start to finish it's quite simply an awesome movie, maybe even the greatest superhero movie of all-time.  The Avengers is spectacular.",10
"May 14, 2012","Excellent and very funny movie!  All the main characters get some great lines, lots of good action, lots of fun.

Easily one of the best superhero movies in recent memory (excepting the amazing Batman reboot series).

Best. Line.  Ever.  ""Clench up Legolas"" (said by Ironman to Hawk-eye).",10
"May 14, 2012","When Iron Man or Hulk was on screen it was awesome. The only good actor was the guy who played Hawkeye.

Every time Captain America was on-screen it was painfully bad.  It was good an bad at the same time.",8
"May 14, 2012",Where's the story?  Lots of punches but nothing to make me interested in the characters or the plot - what plot?   What does it say about us that this movie has been so popular?   I followed MC's recommendation and was sorely disappointed.   The bits of humor and Robert Downey were the only bright spots in a really boring movie.   Loki's horns looked ridiculous.,2
"May 14, 2012",This was a great movie,10
"May 13, 2012","It's a kids' movie! Extremely predictable plot, clichÃ characters, unrealistic comic relief. Effects were great, and great cast. Part of what makes this movie great is the fact that many other movies led to it. But the movie by itself... not that impressive.",7
"May 13, 2012",This movie was extremely fun to watch and also had a good plot. It was fun to see all the different guys come together. The humor was pretty damn good for an action movie. It was also cool seeing Captain America (Chris Evans) because he grew up in my hometown. This is a movie I would watch again.,9
"May 13, 2012","I kept hearing this movie **** over and over, but it doesn't, in fact It's pretty good. The story had a good level of clarity and didn't do anything that contradicts the comics and other media too badly, the biggest complaint I have is the bad guys in the movie are a little lame.",8
"May 13, 2012","The Avengers has everything money can buy going for it and not much else.  There's nothing offensive in the film but nothing provocative either.  Did anyone here feel any tension whatsoever watching this?  It plays it so safe.  Hey, there's a lot of great stuff for the eyes, the pacing is good and I think the dialog is pretty funny, but there really isn't much substance or originality.  A summer thrill ride and then it's over.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.",5
"May 13, 2012","I was trying to keep my expectations tempered. Now I have excitement churning in my chest, and a grin on my face that I can't fight. Can this be out already?

"May 12, 2012","An amazing balancing act of chaos, explosions, big heroes, big actors, and good humor all done very well. I am very impressed that everything was done so well yet so balanced and entertaining. This sets a new standard for multi cast action films. Take note transformers.",10
"May 12, 2012","The best movie this year by far, and perhaps the best superhero movie of all time.  The sheer awesomeness of The Avengers cannot be explained with words.  It was completely amazing.",10
"May 12, 2012","This movie has flow, comedy and good character development. It is what you hope for when you go to see the movies. I don't make sweeping generalizations without substance unless I feel certain, this movie is brilliant.

Just go see it.
It's worth the 10 I'm giving it.",10
"May 12, 2012","This film was great - it had fantastic visuals, nice characters, breathtaking fights and kept me interested all the time. I consider it a great success :) There were also genuine comedic moments, when the entire cinema laughed. I enjoyed it very, very much and this is what is all about.",10
"May 12, 2012","Well designed characters, good acting, nicely balanced humour and very good visual aspect sum up to make of this film a very enjoyable movie, even for those who like me are not particularly fond of superheroes.",8
"May 12, 2012","It lived up to the hype! Its still just a comic book action hero movie which is to say ""shallow action flick"" but I have to give it props for doing it extremely well. I, along with most of the other movie goers in our theater had several laugh out loud moments thanks to M.D. Jr.. The special effects were spectacular. I saw it in 3-D which is never my preference. It didn't feel contrived to exploit the 3-D effects, it just amplified the experience.
Take the kids but leave the wife at home she'll hate it.",8
"May 12, 2012","""Joss Whedon is a freaking Genius"" .  It was so difficult to put together something like this but his amazing Story and Direction  made the movie awesome . It was very thrilling and the action scenes were incredible  and its had some really funny moment too which tells that the movie is not boring at all. Robart , Tom was the best as they were before. Hamsworth was good but not better then he was on Thor . Evans on the other seemed kinda different . seems like he was too angry about everything . Scarlet was super and her action scenes were perfect but hated her hair style. S.l.Jackson and Jeremy was super too . And last Cobie was the surprise of the film . I saw her every week on HIMYM but here seeing her beauty just made my day ! plus her custom was WahaaoooO !!!
Effect was good as well as al the other work . But I didnt like the theme song that much . It wasnt bad but its not catchy like other superhero films.Overall The Avengers is a total perfect Entertainment !

Really want to thank The Avengers Creator Stan ""The Man"" Lee (Respect)! and co-creator Jack Kirby.

tnx to Marvel , Disney & Kevin for taking this Dream Project and turning it into a freaking awesome movie !",9
"May 12, 2012","This is the type of film where if you don't take it seriously, and just sit back for the fun of it, you'll have a blast. It reminds me a little of Independence Day. The writing and characters are piss awful, but the sheer spectacle makes it fun enough to give a decent rating. If you go into the film wanting a fun action movie, then The Avengers provides, but if you want a sophisticated superhero movie like the Dark Knight, then save your money for the Dark Knight Rises. The film is difficult to score, but it is a blast to sit and watch. Go see it.",7
"May 12, 2012","The first ten minutes of The Avengers is amazingly action packed and there isn't even a super powered hero in sight. It only gets increasing doses of ""Oh MY GOD"" from there! I found myself constantly saying to myself "" Well nothing will top that,"" then BAM! topped it becomes. This movie will make you want to joyously cheer at the screen and you will.",10
"May 12, 2012","There is too much mayhem in the movie for my taste, although the story line is quite interesting: getting a group of superheroes, whose styles and personalities essentially do not click together, to get one supremely difficult task done. And the Big Boss is a black man! I would have liked to see some other minority groups, i.e., Asians and Hispanics, take a part in this huge enterprise too.",6
"May 12, 2012","This movie is just made of WIN, truly mind-blowing but also thought provoking. Definitely not one of those action hero movies where the switching off of one's mind is compulsory.",9
"May 12, 2012",The Avengers is one of the greatest movies I have ever gone to **** you like action films with no romance this is the film for you as there are no soppy love scenes which every action movie fan hates. Plus there are some humorous parts for people who like some comedy in a movie. Overall all the actor's and actresses played their role perfectly.I strongly recommend you see this film.,9
"May 12, 2012","Ben_Otter, Omg you must not been reading any comics when you were a kid. Superman,Green Lantern and Batman belongs to the DC comic syndicate and their hero group is called the Justice League... The Avengers are group of heros from Stan Lee's Marvel Comics.  Completely different heroes from completely different storyline. Justice Avengers? Wow, that's a good title for a spoof comedy movie . It really shows how knowledgeable you are Mr Otter  hence your spelling too needs improving. I do not know what you look for in rating a nice movie. Personally what makes a great movie is its villain. I would say the villains of marvel comics/film  are a lot scary and powerful than the ones Superman and Batman encounters. But again I wonder what movie creators of  DC's Justice League would have villains on it.  Ben_Otter,  I would avoid making comments until you do a little research about  any movie you watch and review. Power Rangers have such lame villains(nice design costumes though very colorful) and they do like  move, position their arms and head nodding a lot to communicate  cause they do not use their mouths, people would find you strange and avoid you if like to be such a Power Ranger  hero.",10
"May 12, 2012","@Ben_Otter  Green Lantern and Superman are DC characters so no they wouldn't be in a Marvel movie you moron!  Anyway this movie was pretty good.  Not the best movie I've ever seen, but I'd definitely recommend it.",7
"May 11, 2012","Best superhero movie in a long time! Exceeded my expecations. I was afraid theyde make some of the characters tacky, but it felt like they belonged. Ruffalo does an excellent Banner, after Norton i was pleasantly suprised. Just goes to show what Wheadon is capable of. Now the sequel better not be another revenge of the fallen milking i hope.",8
"May 11, 2012","Everyone has been saying that this is the best superhero movie ever and maybe the best movie ever. It's definitely not the best MOVIE ever, but it does contend to be the best superhero movie. I can't give it a 10 because it didn't finish, obviously there's another one coming and it did have a few things I would change. I wish that there would have been more enemies that weren't just random creatures.

But the movie was great, with great action scenes and good dialog and was very funny at times. I would give it an 8.5 if I could, but I cant and I won't go down to an 8, so it gets a 9.",9
"May 11, 2012","Superhero movies need two things - a decent baddie (not too camp, not too psychotic) and the film must still be watchable when the heroes are in civilian mode. Does The Avengers have both of these? Just about. The baddie, Loki from the first Thor movie, has the (Hollywood) required British accent that all baddies must have these days, and weaves carefully between camp and stabby-nasty, without straying too far into either territory, though the horned helmet was surely daft.

When the heroes aren't on screen, the movie's carried by Samuel L Jackson, Robert Downy Jr, and Chris Evans, who together manage to neutralize Scarlett Johansson's usual monotone, single expression, cardboard cut out performance. New Hulk on the block Mark Ruffalo, is probably the best Bruce Banner to date. Thor and Hawkeye make up the numbers, and though I loved the Thor/Hulk punch-up scene (comic fan boy wet dream), thought the film would haven't lacked if either Norse god or arrow slinging assassin had stayed at home. Script-wise, there were some nice touches, with Samuel L Jackson's Rick Savage (silly name) leaving one classic sentence unfinished and therefore adding to the kudos factor ten fold (you should spot it if you're paying attention). Luckily there wasn't too much of the irritating Tony Stark/Pepper Potts sniping that made Iron Man 2 so hard to bear. Chris Evans' Capt America was the biggest surprise for me. I thought in a lot of ways he was the clue that held the thing together - neither too gung-ho, too whiny and too daft, three traits that curse a lot of on screen superheroes.

The action sequences were ok, but the one at Shield headquarters felt a little contrived. The pacing also abruptly shifted down a gear about half an hour into the film, and stayed there for what felt like too long, with all the talkie bits stitched together in one long sequence. On the whole though, quite good for a superhero film, and from a box office point of view, beat that Spider-Man and Batman.",7
"May 11, 2012",There is a lot to like about the avengers - it starts slowly but builds up to a genuine climax and the last 30 minutes are exhilarating at times. Its strengths centre around its humour and the banter between the key characters. What's a little disappointing is that amongst the range of opportunities for special effects there is little new to excite - perhaps special effects in movies have reached a plateau.,8
"May 11, 2012","After setting it up with multiple films about how the individual characters gained their super powers, The Avengers finally brings together all of the heroes in one story to either work together as team to defend Earth or fight amongst each other aided by their massive egos and verbal bravado.  Perhaps never before in cinema history have there been so many movies released as prequels to set up the eventual crown jewel.  Batman and Superman only met in the comics, not on the big screen.  The Avengers appears to be sort of a test case to see if so many leading superheroes can all share the same screen.

While all six characters each receive a certain amount of on screen time and side story, some are pushed more into the foreground than others.  As Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is a fan favorite and is always handy with a funny quip, he is front and center along with Captain America (Chris Evans) who even though does not have much of a super power, places himself in a sort of leadership role within the group.  Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and the two characters that did not get their own films, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) all fight for the leftover screen time in the background.  The puppet master is Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who spends most of his effort in sheep dog mode herding these guys from their billion dollar towers or their self-imposed exile.

So what possible threat is great enough to require the efforts of six superheroes?  Eh, itâ",7
"May 11, 2012",So good makes me wish DC would do something with the Justice League. TA is everything you want a super hero movie to be and then some. And welcome back Hulk. Genuine breakout star of this movie.,10
"May 11, 2012","I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie in the theater. That said, it was a bit on the long side and was just short of 2 hours and 30 minutes. Not sure what they could have cut out though.",9
"May 11, 2012","What's not to like? Pick your favorite superhero and you'll probably find him/her/it in this film (sorry Spiderman, but you have another film coming up).  Great humor.  Super effects. Robert Downey, Jr. steals the show - not easy to do next to the Hulk - and his humor is so off the cuff that I wonder if he wrote much of it himself.  Either way? It works!  It's a summer blockbuster.",10
"May 11, 2012",This movie is full of awesome. I enjoyed every minute of this movie. It was like watching comic book come to life. Joss Whedon knows how to bring a ensemble cast together and make you want to know what going on with every character.,10

"May 10, 2012","I love this movie. My experience is based on the fact that I have seen the other Marvel movies to come out before this. Quite frankly, I was amazed at how coherent the plot was with so many characters on the screen at one time.

If you have NOT seen the prequel films to this one, I would HIGHLY recommend that you do. You are doing yourself a disservice.",10

"May 9, 2012","An amiable way to while **** long was it? I found it less engaging than either Iron Man 1 or Thor, and whilst the dialogue interludes were welcome relief from all that crashing and banging, they didn't really go anywhere to help create believable characters. Not the point, perhaps: you can't create 'belief' in demi-gods and superheroes who are, to all intents and purposes, indestructible, by endowing them with mortal failings like arrogance, brotherly love, rage, patriotism and a desire to set the record straight?

On the plus side, Mark Ruffalo's Hulk; stupendous effects (undermined by their ruthless efficiency - they're not special anymore) and a couple of good belly laughs; Scarlett Johansson in leather...",7

This just shows what happens when you put the right people in the right situation. HULK SMASH!!!",10

It's truly a masterpiece how great this movie's visuals are. Acting is good. Everyone does a pretty good job. Story is real good. Also great script.  It can be very funny. Music is real good. Overall, this is a great film that has almost everything. It's funny, full of action, full of awesomeness, and has 100% all fun. Everyone absolutely should go see it.

"May 9, 2012","This movie is great.  I went to a midnight premier and was not disappointed.  Recently most Hollywood productions have been lackluster or had serious flaws.  This is not true with The Avengers.  The story was tied together very well, adding continuity from the other characters movies without detracting from the main plot in this movie.  What really makes this movie great is the amount of ""Oh **** moments.  I was excited pretty regularly throughout  the movie and not infrequently the theater broke into applause.  See this movie if you like fun.",9

This movie was amazing in every aspect, script acting, funny moments, character development, character interaction, special effects, the best superhero movie ever made PERIOD.
Is the best movie i've seen in quite a while, and definitely the best of the superhero movie franchises.
I would say a MUST SEE for everybody... no exceptions!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10
"May 9, 2012","This was one hell of a difficult movie to pull-off; all those characters together makes it near impossible to create a cohesive story....well this movie made the impossible. We all thought that this was going to be Iron man 3 but the whole story is surprisingly balanced. Its not just balanced between all the characters but there is also balance in the action, comedy, drama and suspense. There's also a piece of the pie for the SHIELD agents, fury, widow and hawkeye all get great characters to play with. But the greatest of all is Phil Coulson he steals every scene he's in practically. Every piece of the plot piece is stitched together into this coherent and utterly mind blowing story. Obviously, the avengers needed a great villain and Loki is perfect for the job.  The only real complaint is that the army that Loki allies himself with are not that up to standard... OK they have guns and a huge serpent/fish thing but they're nothing special. There isn't that CGI to match transformers, but hey its much more better that there is nothing similiar between the two.",8
"May 9, 2012","How many comic book based movies get it right? Not many.  However, this one does and does it really damn well.  When I went to see this, I half expected the movie to spend an hour getting everyone together for a the big finally which would last maybe 15 minutes.  Thus, my expectations were low. Real low.

But, much to my surprise, they made that quick and easy. Most of the movie is action based. Even better, they still add a lot of plot to the movie as to not be on a one way track. The graphics are extremely impressive and you will find yourself arguing with friends about who your favorite hero was. Mine being Iron Man. Bam!

Overall, was it the best movie I ever saw. I don't know, maybe.  The reality is, will you have fun when you go to see this? I say yes. So go drop some cash on popcorn and drinks. Sit back, relax and enjoy the action.",9
"May 9, 2012",I'm not a great comic book fan but found this film reasonably engaging. Robert Downey Jnr steals the show and the captain America character seems just as underplayed as his was in his own film. Looking forward the the inevitable sequel but it would be good if Hollywood could come up with some original idea's as well!,6
"May 9, 2012","When the world is threatened with domination from beyond, a slew of Marvel superheroes (Iron Man, Hulk, Capt. America, Thor and more) is brought together to save the day. Before that can happen, we get some internal conflict and snappy dialogue by writer/director Joss Whedon. Finally, comes the big, noisy, kinda silly showdown: implausible on so many levels. Luckily, the cast is full of quality actors, so most of the interaction works. This is a classic big-budget summer flick with spectacular scenarios and flashy effects. Not the best, but not the worst. NOTE: There are 2 post-credit scenes, so stay till the end for your money's worth.",8
"May 9, 2012","This movie is by far the best start to the summer movie season we've had in a LONG time.  Everything was perfectly timed and the cinematography was stunning.  Some of the best 3D work since Hugo.  Robert Downey Jr was completely on top of his game in this movie.  He has taken the character of Tony Stark and taken him to a WHOLE NEW LEVEL!!  This movie was big and epic and its the way it should've been!!  Would almost want to see it again but only in IMAX, but Dark Shadows comes out next week, so it looks like a one and done deal for me until I purchase it on 3D Blu Ray.

In closing, if you havent seen this movie yet, get out there and see it.  You'll laugh, applaud, and cheer right till the very end.  Also, FYI, stay til after the end of the credits for a special treat!",10
"May 8, 2012","I had the great opportunity to watch this on the 2nd of May on an Imax 3D equipped cinema  and my wife and me had a blast of a time. I've never seen my wife (whose never read a Marvel comic in her life) so excited throughout a movie. After the movie, she was all questions.

Joss Whedon put together a pretty difficult idea that was born with the first Iron Man. Something incredibly hard to pull off and some say too bloody expensive to make.

I think Tom Hiddleston and Mark Ruffalo stole the show and I can't wait to see Mr. Ruffalo in the next Hulk movie. Suffice to say, go watch The Avengers, it's the best Summer Block buster ride till Mr. Brooding Knight Rises.

****'s a great time to be a comic geek!",10
"May 8, 2012","You couldn't ask for finer popcorn entertainment. I enjoyed this movie as will most people, especially kids. However critically speaking there is not much more to offer and the film doesn't provide any great depth for those who don't appreciate big action movies. The humorous banter between the cast of disparate characters trying to come together is clearly a strong point. The lack of development on a couple of key players detracts from an otherwise rather wonderful character-driven experience. The plot is largely derivative and predictable but as the focus is on characters it remains true to the spirit of the comic source material. The exaggerated violence while amazing and funny is, when you consider the flip-side, implausible and cartoon-like at points. Avengers is a highly enjoyable movie and a grand visual spectacle to boot but won't appeal to anyone looking for meaningful cinema.",7
"May 8, 2012","First and foremost Hulk absolutely steals the show.  He has the best moments and best character development.  Awesome job.  Second, the teaser at the end was so amazing I lost sleep.  Third the film did an excellent time of showcasing the whole cast (a feat I didn't think they could pull off).  Fourth I actually liked Captain America in this movie, I was bored to death by him in his own movie. The interaction amongst the characters was fast and clever, making more room for great action scenes to satisfy any Marvel fan",10
"May 8, 2012","I won't say that I am a fan of the entire movie, but it certainly was the most intense and action packed superhero movie I have ever seen. I have never been so genuinely excited to partake in an adventure with heroes and villains before. I loved that the action was easy to watch, and the dialogue never truly became cheesy and cliche. The beginning could be a bit better, but the massive battle for the last hour of the movie certainly makes up for its smaller mistakes. I loved the Hulk, Iron Man, and Black Widow. Great job, much better than I expected!",8
"May 8, 2012","Star filled lineup with perfect execution. The Avengers is probably the best action movie I have seen to date. All main characters acted and worked so well together it was great and the comedy mix was perfect. A perfect execution and amazing job by Joss Whedon, Zak Penn, and the cast and crew. (message me for my full evaluation)",10
"May 8, 2012","This is ""Power Rangers"" for adults, with fancier special effects. Please, a flying invisible aircraft carrier. My suspension of disbelief broke into a million pieces. It obviously wasn't there when the film asked me to believe that the horrendously destructive battle of six spiffy looking Marvel characters and thousands of space creatures pouring through a space portal in the middle of New York City didn't lead to the wholly unnecessary deaths of thousands of people. Please. ""It's just comic book stuff"" doesn't excuse the fact that it still must be made to look reasonable for the viewer to buy into it. There was no one to root for, no real plot tension, no depth of character -- the constant pointless bickering between Avengers doesn't count. Come on. What kind of shallow people these days think that a film that merely amounts to an agonizing overload of street kickboxing to defeat an effete space god is a ""10"" on this scale. Have video games made so many people this way? That's the real scary thing the Avengers should be avenging.",2
"May 8, 2012",The movies was pretty fun to watch however ..Thor and the hulk looked bloated.really wished they would have shown hulk getting larger when as he got more upset.,10
"May 8, 2012","Loved it. Probably the best Marvel movie yet. I thought the plot made sense and every character had a purpose.

I have to say, I was not terribly stoked about this after I saw Joss Whedon was behind this. I probably enjoyed it more going into it expecting much less.",10
"May 8, 2012","The Avengers is the best Superhero movie Ive had the pleasure to watch. IT has an amazing cast, amazing effects, decent story, and best of all, it stays true to the comic books, for which it was inspired by. We dont have Whedon changing major back stories from the original comics, instead we get a homage. Ive gone to watch it twice already, and the people that ive gone to watch it with are no ""Marvel fans"" yet they enjoyed the crap out of it. Watching a movie like this with a big crowd is actually good, because everyone cheers and laughs at all the amazing moments that happen through out. If you have a sense of humor, you will love this movie.",10
"May 8, 2012","Amazing movie, everything a comic/superhero fan could ask for. Joss Whedon does a great job bringing characterization to such a humongous cast in such little time. Everyone from the Hulk-Hawkeye got their moment to shine and win your heart. I can not wait for a sequel and want Joss to direct more Marvel movies.",10
"May 8, 2012","OK--first the pro's: great cast, stylish production values and some good moments. There was some of the clever dialogue I associate with Jos Whedon and some scenes that made me laugh. That said, Avengers is to Firefly or Serenity what the WWF is to Olympic wrestling--too LONG, lots of repetitive CGI. You'd like to think that Firefly was about people as a matter of choice, not because of a small budget alone. This movie makes me wonder. When it comes to CGI, just because you CAN doesn't mean you SHOULD.",5
"May 8, 2012",Film is viewable only because of Robert Downey jr. and Mark Ruffalo. The other actors and their characters are look so childly. Also idea of combination a couple of comics' heroes is great working. Recommended for everyone who not sick of comics movies.,8
"May 8, 2012","@subseq

//Please. ""It's just comic book stuff"" doesn't excuse the fact that it still must be made to look reasonable for the viewer to buy into it. //

Wait, what? It _IS_ just comic book stuff, you clown. The title of the movie is ""The Avengers"" ... which, shockingly, is the title of the comic book series.

What movie did you think you were going to see? Did you get lost on your way to ""The King's Speech"" or something?",7
"May 8, 2012","I want to say a lot about this film but this is such an awesome film that it can easily be summed up quite quickly. Think of an action film - for example, Transformers is a good one - with two dimensional characters, humanity, real humour and a wonderful story to boot. Even the villain has his own personality and a legitimate reason to invade Earth. This is one of those films that even for the umpteenth time you will continue to be entertained. Have you ever seen multiple superheroes from different films from the coolest comics come together with such ease?",10
"May 8, 2012","I was gitty about going to see the Avengers debut, and I was hopeful Whedon could pull off such a difficult task. This is basically a film where almost every one of the main heroes has been in the lead role. Just the fact that Whedon found a way to juggle these characters is amazing, and the film itself is a remarkable accomplishment on its own. With scenes seemingly torn from the comics themselves, its a blast to watch (i went to the theaters multiple times), and is the best Marvel film to date. Cannot wait for a sequel!!!

P.S. after credits scene, the second one, was hilarious. Great stuff",10
"May 8, 2012","Lives up to its hype? Maybe but my expectation is broke. I don't know, maybe it's difficult to these superheroes join as a team. But they're not even a team, they're time bomb. Intriguing dialogue, funny and big boom explosion, it's not best comic book movie but Joss Wheddon succeed bringing Marvel's most ambitious project so far. I don't understand what Loki's motive, even on Thor, I expect more reliable and crazier character like Ledger's Joker. Anyway, we want sequel.",8
"May 8, 2012","The culmination of 5 different superhero movies into one explosive mix, there has never been a movie as ambitious as this. The performances, visuals and humor are all top notch, as expected in a Marvel movie. The story itself was what everyone was expecting, and while that may have disappointed some I think they still did a great job bringing everyone together for the first time. Maybe in Avengers 2 they can throw in some surprises, but this was all about making it work, and it worked.",10
"May 8, 2012","I think that the movie was a bit slow at first but then picked up a bit near the end. I did not enjoy the movie as much as everyone told me I would. I thought it was very okay compared to the other superhero movies. Some of the jokes they made were funny, but others were very lame. I just think that they may have relied a little too much on the effects rather than the story. I did not feel attached to any of the characters. Perhaps the only character I felt was the most fun to watch was Bruce Banner who played the Hulk. They are all amazing superheroes individually, but I did not feel the chemistry between them as a team.",4
"May 8, 2012",Fantastic.  Entertaining from beginning to end (even past the credits).  Well written and humourous without going cheesey (like THOR).  Scarlett Johansson was super hot.,10
"May 8, 2012","Taken on its own, it's a great action movie with laugh-out-loud comedy and fine character beats.  But you HAVE to factor in the ""degree of difficulty"" of what Joss Whedon has accomplished.  By all rights this thing should have been a total mess.  All those heroes sharing one movie? Giving them all their proper character moments, action moments, individual plot arcs while simultaneously giving them proper interpersonal chemistry AND developing the Avengers organization WHILE progressing a movie plot.  Whedon pulled the sword from the stone and somehow  makes it all work. Much as I love Nolan I have to admit he could not have done this. This took all of Whedon's career of creating great ""family"" dynamics show after show in his TV series.  It took real genius to pull off this movie, and the reviewers who can't see that should pack it in.",10
"May 8, 2012","Doomed, that's the first thing on your mind when you think about the Avengers. Joss Whedon is worshipped by his fans like a god, but his recent projects weren't that successful. The basic premise is very difficult to portray in a movie: how could you manage to give each character a decent amount of developement?  Actors: how could you make this people interact with each other without prima donna dilemmas? Well I was surprisingly pleased to see this movie. You have to suspend your disbelief in order to enjoy it, we're talking about attractive people with ridicolous costumes with superpowers. Fortunately the dialogue is funny and interesting enough to give this characters a minimal amount of depth. Iron man is the star of the show, he could be charming even if he was shown buying toilet paper. I never heard of the Black widow before but she is a serious contender for spotlight - stealing. The others characters are okay, for me Thor was the least interesting character. The villain on the other hand, seemed interesting, I think a lot of his scenes were cut that would further analyzes his motives or his ideals. He is not the classical:""I am EVIL, I want to rule the world with my EVILNESS!"", he has reasons. Action scenes were superb, very entertaining and fast paced.   In the end I think this movie is for everyone: comic-book lovers and not nerdy people :). It may not be an historical turning point in storytelling, but I'm sure you'll leave the theatre satisfied.",8
"May 8, 2012",Great movie well written well directed and had some really cool scenes the characters where coordinated really well and the action was amazing I would certainly see this movie again in theatres,10
"May 8, 2012","1 word...AMAZING. totally worth the wait. you got comedy, action and scarlett johansson in it :P i mean Joss Whedon really did a brilliant job on the movie. usually 2 and a half hours could tend to get you a bit cranky but this movie was brilliant and the 2.30 hour run time felt like nothing cause it was so fast paced. loved it and i hope they make a sequel.",10
"May 8, 2012","1 dimentional characters, weak plot, over the top.......
If this is the description of fun then give me Avengers any day. This film is fun & exciting. I've not had such a good, mindless & happy time at the piccies for a very very long time. I loved this film from start to finish. It's been a long time since I didn't want a film to end. Avengers is excellent fun, it never takes itself too seriously and has some cracking one liners and  visual comedy thrown in for good measure. There's even respect for the eldest member of the team towards the end. Go and see this movie if you want to enjoy a trip to the piccies.",10
"May 7, 2012","Best Marvel film yet? Maybe not. Best Joss Whedon film? Nope, Serenity's smarter and darker, and the Whedon co-written The Cabin In The Woods is more ambitious. But what makes The Avengers so impressive is how it manages to stick to a classic comicbook/action formula, yet somehow feel utterly fresh and distinct. Be it the script, the settings, or the combination of so many superheroes sharing screen space - all freed from an origins story arc or sequel expectations - it just feels--- new, and gleefully satisfying. The characters are bold, yet feel human. And the action is spectacular but never dehumanising (we don't *need* to see civilians being killed during the major set-pieces).

It also absolutely nails a universal audience appeal. Marvel nerds (of which I'm one) can obviously love it, but I've not heard a packed cinema laugh so hard a film for a long time. You really don't need to be a fan to appreciate some of the dialogue or the standout visual gags. Whedon never patronises the audience, giving his characters room to breathe every now and then. But crucially he never forgets why you've paid for a ticket and are sitting in front of that screen: you're there, above all else, to be entertained - and gorram it, he delivers...",9
"May 7, 2012","Not only is The Avengers one of the best superhero movies, it's quite possibly one of the best movies ever released in modern cinema. The action is intense, the humor is, well, quite humorous, and the characters are made in a way where you actually care about them. Although some acting of some of the non-major characters is suspect, that is no reason to not see this excellent, rollicking action film. Everything, from the combat to the lines to the overall delivery, right down to the teaser for a sequel, is so well done. If you have even the slightest interest in Thor, Iron Man (which, by the way, stole the show), Captain America, Hulk, or Black Widow, then see this film. Now.",10
"May 7, 2012","I'd like to just pile on with what everyone is **** SEE THIS MOVIE. As close to a guarentee that you will love this movie as you can come by. Only The Dark Knight Rises might be the other but just echoing what's been said - the acting (given a blockbuster movie) is more than adequate, action scences are spectacular and the directing/script was well done. I've seen it twice and plan a third trip before it comes on Blu Ray later in the year. Must see - you won't be disappointed!",10
"May 7, 2012",A Perfect Ten.  Everything you could ask for in an action movie.  Even the trailer couldn't give everything away.  A must see on every level. The 3-D effects were excellent.  It is just amazing!!!,10
"May 7, 2012",This is a great summer movie period.  Take your kids get and prepare to be absolutely amazed.  I haven't seen effects this real since the first Jurassic Park.,10
"May 7, 2012","Not much I can add to the hundreds of great reviews.  I don't think there's anything that could improve on the movie--everything good was already tossed in!  THIS is how superhero movies should be.  Consider the bar raised.  Not a lot mentioning the SHIELD agents so let me just say, Officer Hill is smokin!",9
"May 7, 2012","Like any great theme park ride, the Avengers blows your mind through its sheer force of movement but also offers just enough clever personality to make the experience memorable rather than numbing.  Some of the critics seem wary of the movie as indicating a vacuous culture:  all style and no substance, so to speak.  Well, if you are of the persuasion that not every movie has to deeply probe the heart of humanity (or, if you are of my persuasion that this moral investigation is not really done best by a movie, anyway), and you like to be impressed by fantastic worlds brought to life in an awesome way, then go see this movie and don't feel guilty one bit.  If, on the other hand, you demand that your roller coaster put some aspect of human life under a microscope, then go try to read Tolstoy through a corkscrew.",10
"May 7, 2012","I saw the Avengers at midnight in regular format, and thought it was excellent. After leaving the theater, I thought to myself  ""It must be awesome in 3D"".  So I saw it in 3D two days later, and thought it was fantastic.  I would actually consider seeing it in 3D again. It is one of the best post-production 3D conversions I've ever seen.  But even when not focusing on the 3D, this film has great replay value.  The film itself was just as good, and possibly better, the second time around.  The storyline may be a bit simplistic, and it may be a bit overlong for some, but these are only a small quarrels.  The action is absolutely incredible, the acting is very good across the board, and the humor is actually funny.  For all of you Transformers fans out there, go see this movie, and see if you'll want to watch another Transformers movie again.  In comparison to those films, the Avengers does everything better. Take my word for it, and see the Avengers in 3D.  It is an extremely entertainng experience.",9
"May 7, 2012","Huge action, huge humour, huge actors. Never seen an epic movie like this. If you love action movies or comics, you'll love The Avengers ! Simply the best Marvel movie.",10
"May 7, 2012","Read The Movie Spot review, wrote it myself, 5000 characters can't summarize how great this movie was. Link below:

"May 7, 2012",I think my brain exploded from an overload of awesomeness! If you are a fan of all the previous solo films... get ready for the best payoff we've all been waiting for since the release of the first Iron Man. I'm going back for seconds!,10
"May 7, 2012","Come for the action, stay for the writing and cast. All of the actors deliver and have a script that's worthy of all of their talents.

Best one-liners ever",10
"May 7, 2012","One of the best Superhero movies to date, has an almost perfect mix of Action, Drama, and Comedy.  Most likely get a lot of hate for this but The Avengers to me blow The Dark Knight out of the water",10
"May 7, 2012","You have got to love Joss Whedon. I've been fond of his works since Buffy the Vampire slayer and I had very high hopes for this movie. What can I say, all my hopes were at least met. Good film.",9
"May 7, 2012","The Avengers is the best and most amazing movie I have ever seen! It has the perfect balance between humor, action, and drama. It is a must see for everyone, even those who aren't really into comic books. My mom went to go see it and even she said she loved it. GO SEE IT NOW!
Monkey out.",10
"May 7, 2012",The best of the Marvel Superhero movies so far. The movie does a great job giving each guy a good moment. It's nice to see this movie FINALLY come together and be really good.,9
"May 7, 2012",This movie is the very definition of the word Blockbuster. It is the most fun I have had at the movies in a long time.  The action was great. The movies was funny and moved at a brisk pace. Nuf said.,10
"May 7, 2012","i went to watch avengers with not very high hopes as getting 6-7 marvel characters in a single movies seemed like a perfect recipe for disaster at that time.  but was i surprised big time and i mean big time!!. its better than iron man 1-2, captain america and both the hulk movies. this is by far the best comic to big screen adaptation and is in the same league as the batman reboot and the 1st transformer movie (part 2 and 3 were very big train wrecks). a must watch for anyone who like supeheroes beating the crap out of everything...................",10
"May 7, 2012","Best movie I've seen so far out of 2012, with spectacular effects and all of my favorite Marvel characters clashing together. Oh lawd, this was a great movie.",10
"May 7, 2012","Marvel's The Avengers is what the stuff of true blockbusters are made of. Usually with superhero movies, only a few of them truly transend the genre to new levels. But with Avengers, the film itself UPLIFTS the genre to new levels.This is a movie you don't want to miss. Go see it. Now.",10
"May 7, 2012","This is definitely no The Dark Knight. Just another superhero-themed movie to fill in the gaps for the long-awaited The Dark Knight Rises. Decent flick, but really forgettable. (They really underused Jeremy Renner here).",6
"May 6, 2012","I love superhero action movies, and though I was really looking forward to this movie, tried not get too high of hopes, so as not to ruin it for myself accidentally.  I don't think it worked though, as I was kind of disappointed in this movie.  It was decent, but it could have been so much better. As soon as it ended, my friend and I, who both love Joss Whedon, and this kind of movie, both turned to each other and shrugged.  We both agreed that Joss has great ideas, but is not a great director of movies.  Some of the shots were kind of random, pacing needed to be tightened up, it felt too long in spots (I started getting sleepy at one point and didn't think I would miss anything if I took a quick nap) and I wanted it to hurry and get to the point several times, and I just didn't feel much connection to or care about any of the ""superheroes"", even the ones I had already liked and connected to in previous movies.  If Joss had more experience directing full-length films, I think this movie would have been much better.  (Sorry, Joss, I really do love you! But, I have to call it like I see it.)  But, all that said, I liked it okay, I just knew that it could have been really good, and was disappointed it wasn't living up to its potential.",5
"May 6, 2012","The story wasn't elite but it didn't need to be. The story to me was better than I expected and the action scenes didn't disappoint. The thing that impressed me about this movie more than anything else is how seemlessly the characters interacted. The characters never lost sight of who they were the whole movie, and the script did an excellent job at having them interact with each other exactly how I thought they would interact. No hero stole the movie and none were snubbed, they all got even air time and they all flashed their powers. I saw this movie twice opening weekend, it was that good.",10
"May 6, 2012","Angels: I expected so much more. I do not want to be a contrarian, but....d'you remember the movie 'John Carter'? ...Well, this reminds me of John Carter, except, the acting is better, and so are the special effects. My mother always says, if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything. I am trying real hard to say something nice, but I'm afraid this review will be short.  This was an electric blue, sharkskin zoot suit, with black and white patent leather alligator shoes, a large diamond lapel pin,  swinging a slim ebony cane with a gold handle topped by a sparkling ruby, and the suit is completely empty! Watching this movie was like going out on a date with this gorgeous curvy sex-on-legs amazon, eyes that make love to you, a sleep-with-me-tonight smile and a hip swing that could cause an earthquake who turns out to be a cyborg, with no engine! The Avengers was special effects in search of a movie.
Angels, stop me now, because I am not saying anything nice. This gets a '7' for the eye popping special effects.",7
"May 6, 2012","The Avengers accomplishes its goal as a fun, super geek event movie. It's not a film, but a movie and a good time. Once people take another look, they will likely notice a weak narrative, not so great special effects, big plausibility issues and less than A+ level filmmaking. Technically, there are many aspects of the movie that are B-level. The actors have a good time, and Robert Downey Jr steals the show.",6
"May 6, 2012","I had been waiting to see this movie since I first heard about it. So, I decided to go see it with a friend on opening night. I was expecting it to be a good movie. Well, it exceeded my expectations, because it was flat out AMAZING! I especially enjoyed Mark Ruffalo, who I never thought was all that great of an actor, as the Incredible Hulk. Plus, the special effects and action sequences were top-notch. What I really loved was the fact that they allowed the characters to be more than just your standard superheroes. Normally, I confess, when I see a fight in one of these movies, I just casually think ""****'s gonna win this one."" But, with The Avengers, I felt as though I were in the middle of the fight, cheering them on. So, if you want a good movie, you seriously can't do better than this. I highly recommend it.",10
"May 6, 2012","I had a great time watching it a lot of awesome fights and action sequences not to mention the special affects, the characters are the same as always you would have had to watch the other movies to understand the  characters, but what I didn't like about the plot is the storyline, the antagonist is a supernatural being and god while Captain America, iron man, and the hulk are scientifically powered, how is captain America or the other non- super natural being going to fight against a god? Thor is the only one could fight Loci, and you know it just doesn't make sense theoretically, Captain America and Iron man are meant to fight villains like for example the Green Goblin or magneto or something scientifically not a god. Thanks for letting me rant =)",7
"May 6, 2012","One of the best films I've seen in a good while. Marvel fans and movie goers will enjoy the action, cunning special effects and the wit. I had such a great time watching the film and I believe the entire audience felt the same way. 10 out of 10 a must see.",10
"May 6, 2012","This is an example of how superhero movie should be done.  The material is treated with respect.  It is not changed around to match some writer's prideful personal vision of how the material should been done from the beginning.  Fans of the material and the characters will be very pleased and will rate this a perfect 10.  I rate it 9 because the story and the villain is a bit of a tired concept.  Not perfect. Nonetheless, the villain is very well done and played by Tom Hiddleston.  Regular movie-goers unaware of the source material should greatly enjoy it, as it is very good movie overall.",9
"May 6, 2012",â,10
"May 6, 2012","While extremely entertaining, the film felt to generic. The whole ""Big city apocalypse"" where our heroes need to learn to work together and save the day.  There is some pretty funny dialogue between the main cast, and the effects were great. Despite the final twenty minute non-stop action sequence, it started to feel boring near the end. I heard such great reviews earlier, and through the whole film I was waiting for it to really take off and amaze me, which unfortunately it didn't.  Pros: The acting is good, for the most part; The writing is funny, yet cheesy; The action and special effects are some of the best as far as superhero movies go. Cons: It felt strangely unsatisfactory; plot was bland and not very original.

Overall Grade: B",7
"May 6, 2012",Wow was I wrong!!! Very good movie!!!!!!!!! Great action all the way through!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was also full of numerous funny moments. Go see it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10
"May 6, 2012","A simply magnificent movie. Perfect blending of story and action, screen never feels overcrowded with action ( such as in transformers) Some of the funniest scenes I've seen in a movie in years. The unbelievably low rating average is from pompous critics who almost certainly decided not to like the movie well before they saw it. If you THINK you will like it, you will love it. If you think you wont like it, you will, and if you think you will hate it, well you are probably an ass anyway.",10
"May 6, 2012","One of the few movies that lives up to the hype and actually manages to exceed it in almost every way. All the actors deserve major props. RDJ continues to make tony stark a compelling character. Cap and Thor both do great with their roles. Scarlett Johansson has never impressed me with her acting chops (she has in other ways though), but she does a great job with the character she is given. Jeremy Renner is unsurprisingly badass as Hawkeye as well. Tom Hiddleston plays the slimy bastard that is Loki so well that it makes sense a team of heroes would be necessary. The scene stealer is the Hulk, whether he is ""the other guy"" or not. Awesome job by Mark Ruffalo and unexpected by me and many others for sure. However, the biggest reason the movie works is because of Joss Whedon. Never seen much of his work but he really shows his skill with dialogue, jokes, character arcs, and especially female characters. The action was the best I have ever seen. Imagine Transformers if it had characters you care about and a story that made sense.  The acting and action were probably expected by all of us, but my worries were with the pacing and how all of the characters would get their due.  The pacing was perfect and I wouldnt have complained if the movie was 3 hours long.  Whedon confirmed there are 30 minutes of deleted scenes, I hope he changes his mind and one day releases the 3 hour film.  As for the characters, they physically fight only within the confines of the story. I was nervous their interactions would be forced, but Whedon does a great job of keeping them related to the story. The comedy in Iron Man 2 really threw off the serious aspects of the story, but somehow the comedy flows within the story so that when the story is serious, you feel that as well.  Not an easy achievement by any means.  While TDKR will certainly be the better overall film (at least it looks that way), The Avengers is the more fun film and a film that you will never get sick of. What a great summer for comic book fans, and movie fans in general. Chances are you have seen The Avengers (just broke all time domestic record), so nothing i say will matter anyway. An instant classic and one of my favorites.",10
"May 6, 2012",Great,10
"May 6, 2012","I finally got to see this in **** WAS F*CKING AWESOME! I am a huge fan of the Avengers, when I first heard their making a movie, I was psyched yet a little worried. I went to my movie theater, and it was PACT, it was crowded with a line from the entrance to the parking lot. It was hard for me to see it b/c it's always sold out. Well, I finally got to see it, and it was so cool I'm definitely gonna see it again. The action scenes are incredible and was fantastic to see my favorite superhero's teaming up all in 1 movie. I don't care if people criticize this saying it's a kids movie, which it's obviously not. I'm surprised about the humor to this film, it actually had pretty funny scenes. The casting was incredible, the action scenes are unbelievable, pretty much everything about this movie was great. People who hate this movie are living under a rock or one of those people that love to nitpick and rant about stupid **** that nobody cares about. I know it's based on people's opinion, but seriously, how can you hate this movie when theirs nothing wrong with it? This is an awesome movie, I would like to say that this hits my Top Favorite Movies of All Time. BEST MOVIE OF 2012!",10
"May 6, 2012","It was pretty damn good, haha. I didn't walk in expecting a good movie honestly, I thought it would be an over the top silly... I don't know. All I know is it was a great movie.",10
"May 6, 2012","Ultimately, The Avengers is a Joss Whedon movie.  For those familiar with Joss Whedon's works, you have a formulaic approach to group dynamics.  There's the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Girl of the group, who is unfazed and stoic to all of the happenings around her and utilizes her femininity to trick the men around her while she lays the smack down.  You have the Goofy Guy who makes light of everything and is terribly superficial.  The No-Nonsense, Misplaced Guy who typically acts like he carries a heavy burden around with him in a world he doesn't fit in with anymore.  And so and so forth.  Essentially, if you've watched Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Serenity, or even read Whedon's run on Uncanny X-Men, you have the jist of his workings, a method he uses over and over again.  If you're a fan, you'll love The Avengers.  If you're not, well, Robert Downey, Jr keeps it entertaining (because this is his third outing in role he's grown into, unlike the rest of the cast).  The Avengers is a good movie, but I think people ought to reconsider whether they're getting something fresh and entertaining, or if Whedon is just exploiting an already established character base of heroes and putting them into a mold he's done several times before.",5
"May 6, 2012","I'm really glad how this turned out. I thought that it would take itself way too seriously, but it had some of the greatest jokes and one liners at the most dramatic moments that weren't completely inappropriate. If u have the money, go see this movie because it's a blast of fun from start too finish",9
"May 6, 2012","To put it simply. Brilliant. we get to see development of characters in other movies like Thor and Stark. And a interesting combo of attitudes and egos within the avengers group, and allows the character to become more established. The movie is humorous, the action engaging and thrilling. In all you will come to the end of the movie and be think that was money well spent. It has to be one of the best movies I've seen so far this year.",10
"May 6, 2012","Joss Whedon's action packed Marvel adventure The Avengers is a success in almost every way possible. With such a big cast and many important characters, juggling them all would be something hard to accomplish, making sure they all get their screen time and we get to see their point of view, but for Joss, making such movies to their fullest potential seems to be in his nature.




The best part about The Avengers is that Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) are all apart of this one (very best) Marvel blockbuster. Each with their own unique introduction (and all giving exceptional performances), you get the chills every time one is introduced and they continue throughout the movie. The Avengers initiative was something introduced to us in Iron Man 2 with our first look at Black Widow and Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., but it wasn't something ever forced until needed. Now that Loki, the god of mischief (brother of Thor, god of thunder) made Nick Fury very desperate, he has no choice to to initiate The Avengers. What brings Loki back? He still doesn't sit well with his adoptive bother having all of his glory with being king of Asgard and plans to destroy the world by stealing the Tesseract (a cosmic cube that can open to portal from planet to planet) and  with his army of aliens.




The Avengers is taken at a steady pace, focusing on the heroes themselves and their relationships with each other developing (they don't like one another at first). While this goes on with the most necessary humor (I'm not being sarcastic) and some action between them we learn more about how Loki's plan is working with getting captured and unleashing his army and how The Avengers work together.




From beginning to end The Avengers is one of the most successful action packed comic book adaptations ever. You couldn't ask for more with everything it serves to fans of all ages. The visual effects are great as expected, and the action is the best I've seen. This was also the first time I could say that the Hulk was portrayed successfully in a way I'm sure almost everyone enjoyed.",10
"May 6, 2012",Anyone who doesn't like this movie needs to get their head out from between their cheeks and re-evaluate their life.,10
"May 6, 2012",THIS IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE MARVEL MOVIE NOW!!! The action is fast paced and well executed. I have always wanted to see all of the famous marvel characters come together so this was a treat. This is the start of Whedon's career.,10
"May 6, 2012","It was a good movie. Not the best, but overall very entertaining. Not the best movie i've seen in years, but it was good.",7
"May 6, 2012","i left the theater in awe. it's the first time i've ever wanted to rewatch a movie right away. while the plot of the villain was pretty standard, seeing these heroes together and how they interact was perfect. highly recommended.",10
"May 6, 2012",I am having trouble thinking of a movie I have ever enjoyed more. I am not  having much luck though.  I cant recommend this movie enough. Can't wait to see it again.,10
"May 6, 2012","""The Avengers"" (2012) is the newest film from Marvel Studios / Disney Studios with the classic superheroes, directed by Joss Whedon (from TV series ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"") and starring multiple characters from other movies, together, for the first time: Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark/Iron Man), Chris Evans (Steve Rogers/Captain America), Mark Ruffalo (Bruce Banner/The Hulk), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Scarlett Johansson (Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow), Jeremy Renner (Clint Barton/Hawkeye), Tom Hiddleston (Loki) and Samuel L. Jackson (Nick Fury).

The film follows the ending hook given after the credits of ""Thor"" in 2011 (just a note, there is also one in this movie, but before the credits, for a sequence of Avengers), with the cube Tesseract of ""Captain America"" â",9
"May 6, 2012",Marvel had their work cut out for them with this film and they delivered in a spectacular fashion! It was not going to be easy to create this super hero squad and throw it up on the big screen. But they pulled it off! All of the cast was great with a surprising performance from Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk. In fact Joss Whedon managed to make me a Hulk fan after this movie. This movie is nothing short of a blockbuster and a hell of ride! A must see for this summer!,10
"May 6, 2012","The only way you will not enjoy this movie is if you already don't want to. It is everything an action movie should be. Each member of the Avengers fills their roll perfectly, saving the best parts of the movie for when they finally come together as a team. The excitement that sprouts very early on grows and grows throughout the story and flowers beautifully at the very end. This is a movie I thought would be ""just okay"". It completely demolished my expectations.",10
"May 6, 2012","Positive Surprise, marvelous entertainment and definitely the best movie of the year so far. After leaving the theater i was both glad and surprised because i did not expect this at all, The Avengers is an extremely enjoyable film with magnificent action and great actors and i can really just say that this may be one of the best superhero movies ever made. And if you have not seen it yet do it.",9
"May 6, 2012","The summer movies are here and The Avengers delivers. Every thing about this movie WILL satisfy the nerd/geek in you. Its is written and filmed like a Marvel comic book movie should be. Josh Whedon has raised the bar on the start of summer blockbusters movies and every other Marvel movie to follow. All the characters are equally woven in and each roll is well balanced that you don't have time to fall in love with just one.  If you have never picked up a comic book and feel like you might be lost on the characters I highly recommend  watching the prior movies that brings this team together, Iron Man, Caption America The First Avenger, Thor, and Hulk. I'm already dreaming of the next Avengers movie.",10
"May 6, 2012","The only reason this movie gets a 9 and not a 10 is because it's not the best superhero movie on the market. Dark Knight is still technically the better movie, but The Avengers provides Marvel's best showing at the box office, and the most fun I've had at a superhero movie. The movie is so great because of the interplay of the characters. I never expected to laugh as much as I did while I was in the movie, and it will continue to make me laugh. The characters/actors interact perfectly with one another, just as you would expect real superheroes to. Combine that with some great actions, some great fight scenes, and some stunning special effects, you have a movie that will be #1 at the box office for weeks to come, AND deserves to be there. If you have a chance to see it in IMAX, do it. You won't be disappointed.",9
"May 5, 2012",very good movie. Cannot go wrong that's for sure. I give it an 8 because the story simply is not as good as super hero movies like batman. The action is really good and the effects are awesome. Definitely worth seeing.,8
"May 5, 2012","To say that Marvel's, The Avengers is a poorly made film tells me that you have no idea of what a good film could ever possibly be. What makes Joss Whedon's film succeeds as a great comic-book movie, no, as a good action film, is in its ability to be clear, concise, tight and conscious piece of cinema. With such an ambitious goal of bringing so many Marvel properties under one roof, the film has to be clear, concise and tight. It has to get to the point, it has to go from point A to point B without any narrative gap, and it has to have a strong film logic. The minute we get confused at ""why is this there"" or ""why did they do that"" is where we as an audience lose interest. The film was tightly packed, but not stiff. The sequences on the helicarrier, where we find that our characters are somehow intertwined, these scenes represent the tightness. Robert and Banner in their interactions shine gloriously, as they convincingly offer an idea that these two could indeed be good friends. It was a nice moment that gave us some readied clarity on the realness of these properties. The action in the climax of the film really showcases the tightness as well. We know who is who, why they move the way they do, and where they are going. We root for the heroes, we want the villains to lose. But we get some great moments that really shine. His style of ""mise-en-abime"" is critical here and it really shows off his style. He wants the viewer to see everything, but not be confused. It's not perfect. The beginning jumps too fast. Widow needed more backstory as did the Hulk. How did he learn to control himself; the film never fully explains. However so, the film shines.",9
"May 5, 2012","This was such a risky movie, so many ways for this to fail given the premise. Instead we all came away satisfied and surprised at how good this movie actually was.",8
"May 5, 2012","Absolutely everything you would want out of an Avengers movie plus some. In the wrong hands this movie could've gone horribly awry and I'm ecstatic that this isn't the case. Prior to seeing it I was really worried about the 2 hr. 22 min. run but it seriously was not a problem, in fact I wouldn't have minded a 3 hr running time. The action was incredible and the banter between the super heroes was more often than not hysterical. And this is one of the first movies that the 3D didn't piss me off. You owe it to yourself to see this in theaters and experience the awesomeness.",9
"May 5, 2012","Just saw this movie and I was really impressed. The only down side was that you didn't see much of the Hulk until later on in the movie, but besides that Tony Stark was awesome and Hawkeye was bad ass. The Avengers is surprisingly really good, nest to X Men: First Class as the best Marvel movie in recent years.",10
"May 5, 2012","The Avengers was a really awesome and good. I thought it was kind of slow & a little boring at first but the last 25 minutes of the movie was worth the wait. I mean explosions, non-stop action, a giant green man, = awesomeness. This movie was not just awesome, it was also funny, Tony Stark delivered some funny lines, The Hulk was funny too. I didn't watch it in 3D though, but if I did it would be amazing cause stuff flew at you and the screen a lot of times in the movie. You definitely should check it out.",9
"May 5, 2012","The Avengers is the best Marvel film to date and the best movie of the year so far. I was surprised how well they were able to give all the Avengers about equal screen time. Mark Ruffalo is definitely the best Hulk ever, it made me appreciate the Hulk as a character. This is definitely one of the best comic book movies, following right behind Christoper Nolan's Batman films. Would love to see this movie again, and I usually don't see films multiple times. If you are looking for a well written, well directed, action packed film, this is the best one in theaters.",9
"May 5, 2012","Please don't listen to the snobby anti-genre movie reviews. As a guy who enjoys a good introspective, quiet indie full of symbolism and heavy thought... this was a GOOD movie. No, a GREAT movie. I laughed, I clapped, I felt for the characters on screen. Joss Whedon remains a figure of cult hysteria because his scripts tap into the minds ****, and rightly so. He does nothing less in this film, and every single actor is up to the challenge. Of particular note here are Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk - and the best version so far. It's hard to tell how much of this is creditable to Ruffalo's display as Banner and how much credit goes to the writing and CG wizards behind this version of the not-so-jolly green giant. But I will say that this movie finally shed the idea that a proper exploration of the Hulk has to be cerebral, introspective, and outright depressing. This Hulk manages to be both affecting AND fun, and Ruffalo's Banner is just as interesting as the ""other guy.""

RDJ as Tony Stark continues to impress. Honestly, there's no real weak link in the cast. I was a little worried about Sam Jackson's ability to wrap his mouth around Whedon's poppy dialogue, but his Nick Fury carried a fantastic amount of gravitas and screen presence, and really added dramatic weight I was surprised to see from an actor who has become (sadly) better known for his culty larger-than-life persona than his acting.

All in all, this is just a fantastic film, and one I plan to see in the theater again before it leaves - an activity I rarely do in the time of high-priced entertainment. Kudos Whedon, kudos Marvel. I am in awe.",10
"May 5, 2012",simply awesome movie. Thor hulk iron man black-widow hawk-eye each and every character is great. great action thriller movie with good sense of humor. specially robert downy jr. is ridiculously great.,10
"May 5, 2012",It is an entertaining movie on the lines of Thor. I would not call it an exceptionally good one like Iron Man 1 or Captain America. The climax was too long like Transformers 3. I think they should have given more focus to Loki and Hulk because Marvel had separate movies for other characters and it felt like they were repeating the same movie again. It is definitively a one time watch but don't keep your hopes high. 7/10 is my score.,7
"May 5, 2012","Wow, just... wow. I saw this movie today, and all I can say is ""wow"". About a year ago, before the trailer was released, people were really hoping for an Avengers movie. When the trailer was released, it instantly became a ""Must See Opening Day"", due to all of the crazy fans. And when it was finally released, it lived up to expectation! I was really surprised by this because I have been to countless Marvel/DC movies, hoping them to be amazing like ""The Dark Knight"" or ""Spiderman 3"", when it ended up becoming those movies you only watch every couple months like ""Thor"", and I was expecting ""The Avengers"" to be the same way as ""Thor"", but I was completely wrong. This is by far the best Marvel Movie yet! It's definitely a ""Must See""!",10
"May 5, 2012","Exciting, incredibly well written, and hilarious, The Avengers is Marvel's best film. The action is incredibly thrilling, the humor unmatched in a blockbuster, and the performances fantastic. This is the best way to start off the Summer movie season.",9
"May 5, 2012","This movie is possibly the greatest movie this year. It's really great to see so much heroes in one movie. The story isn't the greatest thing, but the humor and gags do fit. The Avengers has fantastic action scenes, a huge and talented cast and at least this movie is not a Iron Man 3, or Thor 2.

So congratulations to Mr. Whedon, who did a great job spending every hero nearly the same time on the big screen. Actually Jeremy Renner had a great performance, I would really like to see him in a own Marvel film.",10
"May 5, 2012","An example of how you do a big budget, blockbuster film in the best possible way. From start to finish, The Avengers is entertainment perfection and the best film Marvel has ever put out yet. Director and writer Joss Whedon implements his trademark humour and cinematography to make the film not just funny, but also tightly paced and action packed. I'm impressed that Whedon could handle this many characters at once, especially heroes but it isn't surprising because he's done it before. While Tony Stark/Iron Man have slightly more screen time and has the most jokes and one liners, not one character is wasted or slandered and the main ensemble cast play each other extremely well and every single one of them gets a shining moment thanks to a very well written script and steady pacing. Mark Ruffalo is the best Hulk ever and I'm surprised that they didn't over sexualised Black Widow in contrast to what the trailers show but now that I think about it, it's Joss Whedon, whom you should know created Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I cannot rave this film enough and I've already seen it twice in the cinema. It is the blockbuster film of the year. It is so entertaining and so much fun to watch and it is a shining example of how a big budget blockbuster film should entertain a general audience. I've seen it both in 3D and 2D but I recommend it in 2D",10
"May 5, 2012","Simply the best on screen adaptation and movie I've ever had the pleasure of seeing! The only film on pare with The Dark Knight. If you can't enjoy this for pure entertainment, then you obviously have personalty issues where as you hate everything and cannot be satisfied. Go live under a rock, same with all the critics who have rated this as below average. Can The Avengers be the final proof the worlds needs to completely discredit and eliminate useless movie ""critics""? The pace, characters, environment, action, and humor were all done to perfection. This is what I've always wanted to see. Thank you for making it!",10
"May 5, 2012","I haven't read the comics at all, but I do know how the characters are. Either way, I thoroughly, thoroughly enjoyed this movie. YOU HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!",10
"May 5, 2012","While this isn't a perfect movie, as far as the recent action focused superhero movies go it is the best of the bunch. Action, humor and small spots of drama come together with bits of fan service to make an enjoyable experience for long time fans of the comics and new viewers alike. Some of the dialogue and story feels rushed in places and you can tell some things were glossed over to provide a smooth continuity but, at least with me, there weren't any large questions unanswered or things left hanging. In fact my biggest complaint would be that I had to see it in 3D because there was no other option, and as with every other 3D movie its too hard to see clearly when there's fact paced action going on or when there are close ups that take up a majority of the screen.",8
"May 5, 2012","Just saw The Avengers and all I can say is WOW!! this is the movie comic-book fans have been waiting for. the action is great, the interaction between the actors in their respective roles is awesome. The movie definitely moves along, in my opinion, considering it is over two hours. It is certainly one of the best comics to movie adaptions I've seen in a long time. A must see!!!",10
"May 5, 2012","It did not help that the trailers spoiled several moments which really were great, but the start and middle were pretty plodding: we've had Captain America, Thor and 2 Iron Mans so we really did not need so much ""assembly"" time. Only the final scenes matched up to my expectations after reading so much ridiculous hype (and seeing the aformentioned trailers).

The Hulk's line is wonderful, but poorly delivered and 2 of the people who saw the film with me did not even catch it as a result.

There's also a lot of exposition completely missing: why was the Hulk a self-confessed untamed monster who actually tries to kill Black Widow but the NEXT time he ""comes out"" he's transformed into an entirely willing ally? Not just willing but intelligent enough to follow ""orders"" and constantly put himself in the right place at the right time ...
There's nothing close to a hint as to why.",8
"May 5, 2012","A well-crafted film that superbly handles playing with four leading heroes. The movie has great sequences of action and the special effects are top-notch. However, it is the character interaction that really shines through, and makes the ultimate assembly worthwhile.",9
"May 5, 2012","Best hero movie of all time, hands down! Very funny, the action looked amazing and the characters are all lovable. All of them. Even the Hulk.... (maybe, specially him)",10
"May 5, 2012","This film is about a group if  heroes, each with their own hubris, and how they must learn to work together for the greater good.  With plenty of action, humor and story, this movie delivers at every turn. Director Joss Whedon knows how to build, challenge and sustain a team driven story.  From his experience with Buffy to Firefly and Dollhouse, he has learned how to develop an ensemble cast and provide each character with enough screen time to not just have time to develop their character, but to have a sense of balance as a whole.   Each character proves to be an essential part of the greater whole. And that is where this movie shines.  No one is left out and everyone is used in a manner that pushes the story and development forward with no real lag in the narrative. My only concern, with a movie this grand and epic, is how Marvel is going to top, or even match this film.  If they can, then the next Marvel movie will be nothing short of astonishing. Bottom line this is the best superhero Team Movie made to date.",10
"May 5, 2012","The Avengers is about exactly what I expected it to be.  A very well done superhero movie.  It's by no means going to be nominated for any awards, but it was the perfect Friday night guilty pleasure.  I went to see it with my 10 year old son.  Even though I read the comics, and he didn't, he knew more about the characters than I did.  I blame video games.",8
"May 5, 2012","Fan Boys (and Girls) unite, our time has arrived!! Not one but 6 Super Heroes in one movie. What chance does the evil Loki have against these guys (and girl)?

For most of the 140 plus minutes it looks like Loki will win the day and subjugate Earth to his rule. But never fear! As Iron Man warns Loki: ""You may have an army but we have a Hulk.""  The story is interesting even for an old timer who missed out on these comic books! The action is first rate and the dialogue is crisp and often hilarious. The real question to be answered at the end of this movie is:  ""How many spin off movies will be created by this box office bonanza""  There is already talk of  Black Widow and Nick Fury origins films and both Iron Man 3 and Thor 2 are in the works. The sooner the better! I'm not getting any younger and the more of these Super Hero films I can see, the longer I intend to stick around. If I outlast Loki then Marvel will just have to find another first rate villain or two.",10
"May 5, 2012","In the context of the debate over the A.O. Scott review of this film, clearly comic book movies can be done extremely well and are worth of the highest praise. The best in the genre include Batman Begins, Dark Knight, and the original Iron Man. All are highly entertaining and evocative films. What strikes me about The Avengers, now a couple of hours after seeing it, is that the personalities of each of the superheroes truly come out over the course of the film, which is essential in elevating them above plastic or wooden action figures, and I didn't think it would be possible, despite Whedon's involvement. Even Scarlett J's Black Widow is terrific - and I'm very much not a fan of her other work. Beyond the strong personalities, there are actually some truly funny laugh lines in the movie, which isn't always the case in this genre. The ""big"" action sequences toward the end of the film are better than your average comic book movie money scenes - and they're certain better than anything in the Transformers films - but I still found myself getting a little bored amidst the mayhem. Finally, its great seeing Cobie Smulders as Sam Jackson's right hand woman in the command center. She's got a future in action films if she wants it.",7
"May 5, 2012",Up to now The Avengers is the best superhero film ever made including DC Comics films. The begining is a little slow with some decent jokes and dialogs lokis army is something totaly improvised for a half normal avengers universe and half ultimate avengers universe hibrid storyline. I was specting a cameo that never happened and to talk about ant-man and wasp in these film is totaly irrelevant. the greedy **** are gonna make tons of money with this avengers films. i dont think any of these actor are compromised with their role or even heard about it before they became thor widow,9
"May 5, 2012","It released here a week before the official  U.S release, so we were much more excited though. generally speaking, first day, first show.Truly amazing experience, one liners for tony stark, heavenly body work from black widow, Arrow sharp hawk eye, Bull frog hammer head Thor, Aye sir - Captain America and the last the smasher- Hulk.  A enjoyable treat from Marvel Studios. Visually enhanced, superb production value, A true summer block buster.",10
"May 5, 2012","Awesome film, if you are a fan of superhero movies then you'll find The Avengers to be absolutely brilliant, but if you're not a fan of these films, it probably won't change your mind about them, even so there is stuff for all sorts of people to appreciate here. A bunch of superheros teaming up like this has never really been done before so this is definitely a very special film and after 4 years build up for marvel fans since the first Iron Man, it has managed to live up to its incredibly high hype. Joss Whedon has done what he does best and has made a bunch of different characters all have multiple and equal times in the spot light without one hogging all of the attention, the balance between these characters is great and it makes it hard to pick your favourite superhero and they all have so many awesome moments. The writing is strong and surprisingly really funny at points and the humour never feels forced and the all of the actors deliver with great performances all around. While the soundtrack is nothing special it still fits in to film well. Overall I came out of the cinema satisfied after seeing Avengers, it was just as epic and action packed as the trailers made it out to be, it wasn't quite perfect and it won't convert the people who aren't into superhero movies but as a whole The Avengers is a great film  that doesn't  come around often, so I highly recommend it.",9
"May 5, 2012","The special effects for this movie were amazing, I'll give it that.  But there is no significant story, the ""come together moment"" is not believable at all, and it takes way too much time to get the ball really rolling.",5
"May 5, 2012","ASSEMBLE all your friends and family to go see The Avengers! It doesn't get much better than this! An ensemble movie done extremely well and there is just so much going on here. Iron Man is flawless as usual, Ruffalo is pitch-perfect as Bruce Banner/Hulk, and the whole ensemble just works. The plot is solid with an imminent threat that is worth caring about, and Loki is a fine villain. Again, there is a LOT going on here, but Whedon seems to pull it all together while still giving each character plenty of screen time. This is a ""smash""-ing good time!",9
"May 5, 2012","This is one of the best action films than ever seen in my life. Every hero work together. God job director I give you a 10. Work hard and you will be the best director ever, maybe and make and other sequel but much better.",10
"May 5, 2012",Funniest super hero movie ever! Had a blast throughout and plan to see it again. Downey Jr. makes the film and my interest in Iron Man 3 is rejuvenated.,10
"May 5, 2012",If you say that this movie is less than a 10 you must be out of your mind. The BEST movie I have seen in such a long time. Each character was played great and how they used the love/hate relationship of each character in the movie into a fun comedy just made the movie that much more entertaining. For all those who love Marvel and their movies I would recommend to go watch The Avengers and see how they change the way a movie should be created and watched. Side not I wouldn't watch it in 3-D from what I was told the movie was made 2-D and then formatted for 3-D.,10
"May 5, 2012","This is possibly the best film ever made. Not the only the best superhero film but the best film ever. I have held the dark knight as my favorite film for a long time and didnt think anything could beat it. The avengers is everything I wanted in a movie a story, brilliant action and humor. Its one of the funniest movies I've seen and the action rivals transformers. The story is what sets it apart and the avengers is truly one of the best films ever made.",10
"May 5, 2012","Entertaining Movie, but the plot was lacking. when there was no action the movie was on the boring side. They were trying to build some conflict between characters, but there just wasn't that much. There was a little  as far as the main character vs Shield but that was it. If they could have build the tension between the Main Characters and actually made it real tension not just some simple disagreements then the Movie would have been better. The action is some of the best I've seen but the plot makes it tough for me to give anything higher then a 7",6
"May 5, 2012","Absolutely the best Marvel movie, if not the entire superhero genre, I've ever seen. Created by a man who lives and breathes perfection and knows the ethos of the Marvel Multi-verse. When a fan who knows how to make movies, makes a **** result is this. Well done Joss Whedon! Normally I have something to complain about with a Marvel movie. At least one thing that will stand out as...""Meh, could have been done better this way..."" However, with this film, I left the theatre two and a half hours later, wanting a longer movie and wanting to change nothing! An excellent film!",10
"May 5, 2012","is one of the best films of 2012 so far, and it all of it because the director could make the six Avengers have their momtentosspecias loki and even the villain had his moment of great importance. tava wonderful cast, this excellent Scarlet, she could not understand the game of seduction that has black widow, Mark did not seem to have been the first hulk movie it being, 'cause he got to understand the anger that has Hulk, Chris Evans played my favorite character and in my opinion it all amazing in this role, Robert again with his amazing power to interpret anything, Chris Hemsworth had a very difficult to interpret the god of lightning and did a beautiful job",10
"May 5, 2012","I am quite possibly one of the biggest batman fans on the planet and i still looked forward to this more than the dark knight rises. Marvel movies dont have quite the in depth story telling that dc comic book movies have, but i would rather watch this again then sit through the dark knight returns. The effects were amazing and even with so many characters everyone gets enough screen time to make the movie feel really balanced. I saw this with 6 other ppl and all of us walked out extremely happy. I would highly recommend this as a great start to the summer movie season. 2012 is looking to be one of the best years for movies in a long time",10
"May 5, 2012","I guess you can't please all of the people all of the time. With many reviewers complaining that this was a brainless action flick, and others complaining that there wasn't enough action, I thought this movie absolutely nailed the sweet-spot between the two, with some of the best action and biggest effect sequences of any comic-movie yet, and great dialogue in between.

The first half of the movie's pretty slow, understandable when you consider all the characters that needed to be introduced/re-introduced. Black Widow got a great introduction, there were some cool moments with S.H.I.E.L.D and some minor scraps between the heroes themselves which were great fun, but the bulk of the action was saved for the big-scale Manhattan battle at the end. With all the actors slipping effortlessly back into their roles (except for Mark Ruffallo's Hulk, more on that later) there's plenty of room for banter between the heroes, which provide some of the biggest fun in the movie. It's hard to pick out one ""main"" character as they all get an equal share in the proceedings, exactly as it should be. RDJ shines once again as Tony Stark/Ironman, his trademark wit and cool oozing from every pore, Chris Hemsworth's Thor bringing his big Asgardian  personallity to the party, all the S.H.I.E.L.D members suitably official and millitaristic. Evan's Steve Rogers/Captain America is the fish-out-of-water in this new time-period, but steps up to the role of team leader in time for the finale. Then there's the Hulk.

Now, I should preface this by saying how much I LOVED Ed Norton's Hulk film. After the godawful Ang Lee effort a few years before, the Incredible Hulk was everything a Hulk movie should be, and I was a little devastated when I heard Norton wasn't reprising his role for the Avengers.  It turns out, I needn't have worried. Ruffallo, in his biggest role yet, shines as the self-depricating Banner, and the Hulk himself has some of the most crowd-pleasing, punch-the-air moments in the whole movie.  Tom Hiddleston returns as Loki, the films antagonist and does a great job once more. He has some great one-on-one moments with most of the heroes, most notably with Stark and of course his brother Thor, but the best by far is his short-lived encounter with the Hulk, a scene which WILL make you laugh, HARD. Now, I could complain that the overarching plot was a little basic as some reviews have, but to be honest I thought the plot was exactly what it needed to be. There's an alien invasion coming, we need to gather Earths mightiest heroes to defend it. That's about the long and short of it and I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. There were simply too many characters for anything more complicated than that to work effectively in the first Avengers movie. Perhaps in future sequels something a little more substantial would work, with all the characters now established as well as their roles within the team, but this was perfect for a first outing.

All of this led to a finale which was just awesome. You know that battle in Manhattan you've seen in all the trailers?  That goes on for half an hour. For the majority of that half-hour, I practically couldn't stop smiling. I seriously dig superheroes, and for me, it was like christmas seeing them all work together against the alien threat. There's a moment where all the heroes are gathered and Cap gives the team their orders, including a particullarly crowd-pleasing order to the Hulk, before they all spread out and do their thing. It was seriously cool.

Speaking of Cap, I have to bring up my only real criticism with the movie, and that's Cap's new costume. It just looks cheap, to be honest. Why they re-designed it at all, I don't know. In the Captain America movie, they managed to make the costume look right without it looking too silly, but this new incarnation just didn't work for me. Other than that, the movie was great. Great fun, great actoin, great humour, great dialogue. If you like action movies, you gotta see this. If you like superheroes, you absolutely must see this. Twice. I've only seen it once, and writing this review's made me wanna go watch it again, so it looks like I'm off to the cinema this afternoon. Enjoy!",10
"May 5, 2012","I've seen it on the 24 of April in thw world premiere in Rome Italy (where i Live). This movie is AWESOME, at the level of Iron Man 1! I liked it a lot! The 3D is not so useful, it would be awesome also without it! It was years that i wasn't so happy to see a film... :D",10
"May 5, 2012",The best superhero movie I've ever seen.  They managed to pull **** combination of comedy and action all in one.  The Hulk fit right in with the rest of the heroes.  Marvel did a great job.,10
"May 5, 2012","You'll already know if you want to see this movie, and if you already know you want to see this movie, you'll more than likely love this movie. Most of the negative critic reviews seem to come from film critics who've let their personal preferences get in the way of doing their job properly. Joss Whedon and his stellar cast have done the near impossible and created an ensemble superhero movie that is fast and funny, as reliant on its whip smart dialogue as its staggering set pieces. To me, it genuinely feels like the modern equivalent of Star Wars or Indiana Jones - a proper event movie that is more than the sum of its (admittedly not entirely flawless) parts. Most of all, unlike its alternatively dour and ridiculous DC counterparts, The Avengers is fun - if you let yourself, there's no reason for you not to enjoy it from start to finish.",10
"May 5, 2012",Surprised and delighted at how this turned out. Not sure the 3d added anything special to the action but the action is superb and the light moments are genius. It cannot be compared to the dark knight in terms of best super hero movie ever but it's exactly what the fans wanted from this franchise.,9
"May 5, 2012","This is the greatest super hero movie of all time and one of the greatest movies of all time.Tons of action and there is no 1main character, the movie evenly divides characters and each one has their **** is actually quite funny as well, and comic fans will absolutely LOVE it.I never found the film boring and this movie has quite a few claping moments for all those people who love to cheer during the movie(like myself). And stay after the credits(like if you didnt already know that).Overall movie is outstanding,good story,awesome characters,insane fights,and great humor.This is going to be movie of the year and is a must see for ALL kinds of people.",10
"May 5, 2012","The Avengers is a fantastically exciting superhero extravaganza. The movie nails all of it's components right. The dialogue fizzes with pithy putdowns and roaring comebacks, the characters are all well defined (even the likes of new-comers Black Widow and Hawkeye) and the action scenes are exciting and easy to follow. Put simply, The Avengers is one of the funniest, most exciting comic book movies ever made.",8
"May 4, 2012","""The Avengers"" is thoughtful, funny, charming, consistent, and balances quiet moments with extremely clear and well executed action scenes. Some critics have talked about Samuel L. Jackson's glue for the superhero team, but Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson is the true glue, the one character that brings heart to the parade.

All of the characters are a marvel to watch, they each continue their story arcs as introduced in previous films, no time is wasted on exposition, and The Hulk finally gets to shine in a brilliant performance by Mark Ruffalo. Robert Downey Jr. is hilarious as always, and matching his timing and talents with the words of Josh Whedon is like marriage made in a heavenly hell. Nice stuff! Other characters become slightly minor, but all of them have their moments. My whole family left the theatre with a smile on our faces.",10
"May 4, 2012","At the core **** film is an even greater story.  At the core of every great story are even greater characters, chemistry and a strong foundation of source material. The Avengers have been around since the early 60s, and the characters even far beyond that. Personally, in the midst of my parents divorcing, I decided to take a second chance on comic books after dipping my toe into Captain Carrot and his Amazing Zoo Crew in March, 1982 while living in Broken Arrow, OK during one of my many, many trips to QuikTrip to either buy ice cream, donuts or penny candy while playing Ms. Pac-Man.  It wasn't a wonder why I became fat around this time.  Fast forward 2 years to May, 1984, when I purchased Avengers (Vol 1) number 243, mostly due to my being intrigued with Captain America.  I instantly fell in love with comics, and needed them to help me cope with the massive changes going on around me at the time.  My heart was broken when the first Avengers cartoon series in 1999-2000 was an embarrassment.  Just a pathetic series.  However, when the X-Men movies did well and other titles like Daredevil, Elektra and Fantastic Four started to be released, I was excited to eventually see, at least, Captain America, Iron Man, etc. on the big screen.  Never did I think a studio would be ambitious enough to attempt The Avengers as a whole.

Over the past few months, I've seen some of the most uninteresting trailers for The Avengers.  I have been so worried thinking that the movie I've waited 28 years for was going to be an absolute disaster.  Trailer after trailer, it didn't look any better.  Did Joss royally screw this thing up???

Well, I saw it opening night, tonight.  The trailers show the tiniest fraction of what happens in this absolute masterpiece.  Sure, it's action-packed.  It's expected to be.  Sure it's got funny moments.  It's expected to, especially with Robert Downey, Jr. as a leading man.  What Joss Whedon did was take the greatest care of characters since Nolan's Batman series.  The interaction between the characters, the way they deal with their own personal concerns and flaws, and how they come together as a team is so perfectly executed it nearly brought tears to my eyes.  To most people it might be looked at as an enjoyable popcorn film; a great kickoff to the summer movie season. To me, a die-hard, multi-decade fanatic of this comic, these films, these characters and the integrity of keeping them authentic was paramount and, honestly, impossible to achieve, in my eyes.  Joss proved me oh-so-wrong.  When I began seeing the very nigh praise, the 93% on Rottentomatoes, etc. my low expectations became super high expectations. How often are expectations like that ever met?  Well, I can at least say they weren't met.  They were left in the dust, exceeded beyond anything my fanboy mind could have conjured.  Bless Marvel, Whedon and these actors for treating multiple generations of fans to a perfect example of how it can be done right.  Sure, Nolan has become the gold standard, but Whedon showed everyone that Marvel can do it too.  My only regret is that Edward Norton couldn't reprise his role as Bruce Banner.  Of the 3 Bruce's, he was the best.  Mark Ruffalo was the worst.  I like him as an actor and he had some of the mannerisms, but Edward captured the intellectual, frightened and loner aspect of Bruce Banner perfectly.  Hulk, however, stole the show.  Without spoiling some of the key aspects of the movie, I will just say that Joss' inclusion of Hulk in the manner in which he was was the cherry on top of this perfect sundae.  While I can't imagine them topping this one, I've been so strongly surprised, I would never say never.  The setup at the end of The Avengers has me so excited about where these movies will continue to go.  I even guessed the surprise ending way early in the movie, but that was a product of my pure geekiness made happy by clearly other geeky people who wrote the film.  Bring it on, Marvel.  Excelsior!  Nuff Said!!",10
"May 4, 2012","After endless hype, The Avengers delivers. All the characters are full of depth and personality. The action scenes are epic. The dialogue is smart, funny, and witty. Everything fans like myself wanted in this film has happened. Not only is this the best Marvel film I've seen, its the best superhero and summer blockbuster to ever be unleashed with this much satisfaction. Go see ****!",10
"May 4, 2012","My wife and I were trying not to get too excited for this movie.  These mash-up movies always a huge risk.  And in this case it was a HUGE success.  They did a great job of giving everyone a proper place in the movie without giving everyone powers to match one another necessarily.  Also compared to other Marvel movies in the past, like X-Men where they decided Wolverine needed act as leader all the time, it was nice to see that they used characters like Captain America to give orders and stay level headed while Iron Man was able to go off crazy and do his thing.  The jokes hit perfect, the timing and action was spot-on.  The only thing that could ever be said was that the plot wasn't too overall complicated and was fairly straightforward along the way, but I don't feel it detracts from the movie at all, as anything more complex would have made the whole thing feel convoluted with so many characters struggling to work together.",10
"May 4, 2012","To put it simply, YES! I would have sat through five more movies like â",10
"May 4, 2012",Good stuff.  Joss Whedon likes and understands these characters as well as what audiences enjoy.  You get what you want plus a little more.  Hulk steals the show...then smashes it to bits.  Great flicks for fans and non-fans alike.  A great pay off to for all of the build up films.  Can't wait to see more from this **** Whedon needs to stay **** spirit makes this thing work.  Great start to the summer.,10
"May 4, 2012","Wow. Just plain wow. I had obviously high expectations, and even those were blown away. Joss Whedon shows yet again why he is one of the best writer/directors in Hollywood. Making every character interesting and entertaining is a tough task, but Joss does it with ease.",10
"May 4, 2012","The greatest superhero movie I have seen by far. Lots of action to be had, very funny moments throughout, and the watching all the great Marvel superheroes fight side by side and even sometimes each other was great. Seeing this at midnight, the crowd was going crazy the entire film and enjoyed so much. 10 out of 10, go see it in theaters, I know I'll be seeing it again for sure.",10
"May 4, 2012","The applause at the movie ending was indicative of my pleasure with the film also.  There were moments of laugh out louds, snickers, and general pleasure received from being treated as an adult human that wants more from a movie than just the fantastic toys.  I would see this one again and told all my friends to pay out hard earned cash to see it.  I only promote the ""good ones"" and this one will be a hit for some time to come.  Way to go.  And Robert D. Jr.; you just get better and better.",9
"May 4, 2012","Damn fine film. Really captures the classic marvel universe. The film's effects are great, does not over-do them too much. It has a perfect collaboration of story and action and HUMOR. I laughed throughout the whole film. They could have had a better villain... Loki was kind of a ****",8
"May 4, 2012","As a director and co-screenwriter, Joss Whedon is no stranger to mixing and matching genres, and 'Avengers' is no different; while it has one of the most engaging, well-written, and slickly paced screenplays ever known to Marvel-based films, met with spectacular action sequences, shot at scrolling multi-dimensional angles--the non-stop action foregrounded from the mesmerizing setpieces and cinematography--too, is the suprisingly clean wit that brings relief at the most opportune times; both when the action subsides and drowsiness kicks in, and when the overstimulation of explosions, sound effects, and ""Hulk-fists"" flood the senses. However, notwithstanding its keen eye for diversity, and its frequent reminder to the audience that its characters are, real people with real lows and highs, and even larger hearts, albeit shown tacitly,  'Avengers' is, proudly so, a mind-vacationing summer caper; one that just happens to be much more tolerable, thanks to its ensemble cast's performances and the aforementioned flair. Assuming the form, though, of the genre, the film is host to, well...problems. Further, it tries arduously to make the viewer unaware of its issues, usually of continuity, masking them up, both literally and figuratively, but fanboys and casual moviegoers alike, will be far too engaged. Nonetheless, if one doesn't think too hard, 'Avengers' is an elite, alpha-male, man-amongst-boys spectacle that can't be missed. Put differently, it more than marginally exceeds its hyped expectations. More specifically, though, the pairing of the script with each of the ""heroes""  is a delight in itself; each brings something a bit different to the table, and each delivers in their role. First and foremost, is Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark. Downey benefits, arguably the most from the quick-punching dialogue, as he wears his arrogant, billionaire-playboy-braggart aura so balanced that, when on-screen, he is all the audience can look at; his performance plays out like he was born to play the character, ""Shakespearan-bearded,"" and all. One can't leave the theaters without Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow on their mind. As the tantalizingly tempestuous scarlet-beauty, she moves the screen with her walk, her talk, and her kick-ass, which apparently all can be done in one scene; think interrogation becomes interrogator. Next, is the unexpectantlyn refreshing Mark Ruffalo who plays the night-and-day role of anxiously cool Bruce Banner and the robustly stalwart and indomitable Hulk. Aside from his own contribution as Banner--which he does wonderfully--is the remarkable semblance his CGI'd-Hulk draws to the original, Lou Ferrigno (the ""hulking"" **** erectus with a thick, bushy, black-and-gray brow as well as the same touch of humanoid sense of self). Chris Evans' 'Captain' is also commendable, although, Evans himself, looks a good 15 pounds slimmer. He steps up to the role, but his same massive physique displayed in his own self-titled journey, is greatly reduced, which in turn, subtracts from his physical prowess. In addition, Hemsworth's Thor looks and acts just as formulated--his Aryan, golden-locks and azure eyes, bulbous shoulders and arms and the same misplaced naivete and ignorance--fits Whedon's mold. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, is no exception. While not as charismatic as the others, his ""Shaft""-like spin, stern, in-your-face, and collectedly in control, is also apt the ensemble. And, although Renner's Hawkeye/Barton adds some action-filler, he doesn't quite offer anything much other than a few bicep flashes and stray arrows; such arrows that never seem to run-out. But, that is only one, very minor, continuity issue found among the many others. At the same time, however, special mention goes to Tom Hiddleson's Loki. Now, here is a villain who is so unpredictably nefarious, that almost an entire film is centered around him, but it works. I thoroughly enjoyed Hiddleson as Loki in ""Thor,"" probably even more so than Thor himself, and again, he delivers with such darkly crafted charisma and snakily twisted facial expressions that is almost as fun to root for him as it is against him. So, yes, each character contributes. But, I have to ask, what's up with Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson. Not quite sure if Whedon is pointing to a, let's say, ""fruity"" demographic or what; his role is not really necessary, and only kills extra time and strong moments. As a whole, though, 'Avengers' packs an astounding beginning, a slow, estrogenic drama-anticlimax, followed by a resonantly solid close that does an incredible job at finishing on a high note; a ringing conclusion that acts as the world's best eraser--it wipes the distractingly uninvolved middle right from the minds of its audience--and re-draws a picture worth looking at: a superior, Marvel-action-flick-masterpiece. Sadly for Whedon, not all are as easily manipulated.",7
"May 4, 2012","Move over Spiderman 2, Dark Knight and X-men:First Class. This movie us literally the best thing I've seen so far this year. I loved every second of it. The film is very well paced and the script is super sharp and humorous. it also makes references to previous movies. I congratulate Mark Ruffalo for getting the character of Bruce Banner right after Edward Norton and Eric Bana didn't quite get it. As for the rest of the heroes, they've improved so much after their previous films, Captain Americas fight scenes weren't as boring as last years efforts. Like the Directors of the individual films. Joss Whedon has done a superb job at directing this, he really deserves an Oscar for this. Overall I thought the movie was brilliant and I look forward to a sequel in the next three to four years. Not gonna spoil the end credits scene but it's epic! A fantastic film and a must watch!",10
"May 4, 2012","Very fun movie to watch. This movie takes the wittiness from Iron Man and throws is into this movie. There really aren't any serious scenes. Everything is just ride filled with action and laughs. The reason this movie won't get anything higher than an 8 from me is because the movie can be too light-hearted for my liking.  When the world is at stake and you have almost every scene ending with a funny line it get's to the point where this movie becomes more of a comedy than an action drama. It's the best Marvel film by far, but the fact that the plot is not very deep keeps it from being more than an 8. I much prefer the take Warner Bros. has taken with Batman because it is more true to life . But if you are a person that doesn't want a movie that takes itself too seriously then you'll enjoy The Avengers.",8
"May 4, 2012","Best superhero movie experience since X-Men 2 for me, it was just so much fun seeing these over the top characters argue and ultimately work with one another. The funny and clever humor, the great action, and the enjoyable and interesting characters, are the reasons why The Avengers is an above average superhero movie I think.",9
"May 4, 2012","The best Avengers film that could have been made. Funny and fun, the characters pop like a comic book character on-screen should. Hoping for future installments of similar quality.",8
"May 4, 2012","The perfect superhero movie. Joss Whedon brings together this cast of completely different personalities together to make a perfect dysfunctional functioning team that can really throw down. The action was exciting and fresh and the comedy was earned. The movie's plot was well put together and wasn't some obvious thing, as believed by many critics. The movie had a strong, dramatic overtone that really grounded everything in the real world, even though it was all pretty fantastic. Overall, this is probably the most fun you'll have at the theater all year.",10
"May 4, 2012","This movie is funny, it has great action scenes, it's just a great movie. Way better than I expected it to be. The characters play well off each other and seem to be cast perfectly. I would definitely go see it again.",10
"May 4, 2012","In all honesty i don't see how they could've made this film anymore spectacular than it was. As a superhero fanboy (especially Marvel) i was in utter awe during the entire duration of the film. Joss Whedon did an absolutely amazing job directing and writing this blockbuster film. It certainly isn't an easy task making a film like this work but he sure did. I especially love how he made Bruce Banner/ the Hulk and Black Widow more of the 2 key characters. It was unexpected but i loved it. I also liked how they finally made the Hulk more **** guy because he's always seen as a bad guy in every film you see. He also looked more like the actor playing Bruce Banner FINALLY! He didn't look ridiculous and unrecognizable for once. On to other things, the comedy in this film was just plain hilarious, and it was of course centered around Iron Man (Tony Stark). With the occasional jokes from Thor and how he is not familiar with Earth and Captain America being, **** or outdated might be a better word. The action was just non-stop and absolutely mind-blowing. It was just perfect, i literally saw no flaws in the spectacle of explosion after explosion, and the CGI was just beautiful because it was perfect. While i was watching this movie, it didn't feel like a movie, it felt like something more, thats how fantastic it was. The acting was spot on, the plot was better than expected, and i can't praise Joss Whedons job on blending the chracters and their stories together enough. He just did such an amazing job, words can't even desribe. Loki was awesome, he was the definition of a villain. Slick, evil, and genius. I felt frigid during certain scenes with him because of how chilling his character was portrayed. All around this film itself is just perfect. The only flaw i saw was the 3D was nothing special so if you cannot decide, go with the 2D because the 3D is not worth the extra cash, but otherwise the actual film itself is **** Avengers is not just a film, it's a cinematic event, and you will love it from the very beginning all the way until the classic end of the credits scene. I cannot wait to watch this film again. Whether you are a superhero fan or not you have to love this film, and if you are a superhero fan like myself, get ready to experience the best 2 and a half hours of film ever made. If i could give this more than a 10 i would! You must see this movie now!",10
"May 4, 2012","This is an incredible film! There wasn't a single point in the film that I didn't enjoy. Plenty of action and brilliant one liners, plus some unexpected laughs. The build up of the individual characters becoming the Avengers was really well done, and I quite like the fact that Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) got a fair amount of screen time amongst the bigger names. I didn't recognise Mark Ruffalo from any other films, but he does a great Banner/ Hulk, possibly even better than Edward Norton!

Even if you haven't seen any of the other Avenger 'intro' films, and aren't a huge fan of comics, this is a must see film! Loads of action and comedy for everyone to enjoy themselves.",9
"May 4, 2012","The film worked best when the Avengers played off each other and in the strength of the majority of dialogue. Loki has gravitas as a villain, Iron man is witty and Hulk is treated with restraint by the film-makers, but steals the show.
It does however have flaws; the extended actions scenes aren't all the memorable and are exhausting (especially in 3D). The opening will make you feel like you missed a film and played too seriously for how silly it is. Loki's army is under-developed, borrow an unrelated (and stupid sounding) name from the comics and are dealt with via a plot-contrivance, followed by a convenient killswitch. A lot of assumed knowledge is required to get for example, Maria Hill's inclusion or the foreshadowing of the final shot of Stark tower. Odd things like not calling Hawkeye, 'Hawkeye' seem like easily fixable glitches that get over-looked. The Avengers is great, but the barebones, flawed main storyline stops it being exceptional.",7
"May 4, 2012","This was a funny action movie that alot a bit too much substance for one movie to contain. While the story was simplistic, I think that was a good thing because of the sheer number of things going on all at once. If you had a story with anymore to it, then this movie would have been really bogged down with just too much stuff. The over abundance of stuff in the movie doesn't let the heroes in this movie truly shine till the very end. Some of the best parts of the movie were when they were interacting with each but that was very few and far between. The final action sequence at the end doesn't disappoint though and it's worth going to see the movie just for that. If you weren't a fan of the previous individual movies for these characters, then this will not do anything to change your feelings toward Superhero movies. However this is a good, fun, and very enjoyable movie that people of all ages will enjoy. Just try not to get bogged down with the sheer amount of content this movie tries to cram into your brain in 2 hours. You might get a headache afterward lol.",9
"May 4, 2012","I didn't go in expecting anything amazing, but hearing that Joss Whedon had both written AND directed it really got me excited (I had though he was only writing the script).  This isn't a thinking man's movie, or an emotional roller coaster, it's an incredibly fun and solid action film.  Where Michael Bay consistently gets it wrong, Joss Whedon has gotten it right:  Build up a good little story, but nothing too complicated.  Build up some genuinely likeable and fleshed out characters, but nothing too complex or distracting.  Mix in equal parts humour and brilliant action, and voila, you have a recipe for the perfect summer flick.  This is by far one of the best of the light-hearted super hero movies.  I'd put it right up there with the first Iron Man and the original Superman.  Go see it (and Cabin In The Woods!).",8
"May 4, 2012","The movie was a lot a fun, and had great character development for just about ever character, besides Loki. Overall it was very well rounded, a hint of romance added, great actions scenes and quite funny overall. It was worth staying up late for the midnight release, I don't understand why the critics are rating this so low.",10
"May 4, 2012","This film is, quite simply, brilliant, everything I wanted from it was there, brilliant action, suspense and humour, fantastically written dialogue and a brilliant balance between all the characters, Tom Hiddlestone is even better this time round as Loki than he was in the Thor movie, much more menacing and convincing as a super villain and Mark Ruffallo is excellent in it, easily the best Bruce Banner we have seen yet.  Just brilliant, can't wait for Iron Man 3 now!",10
"May 4, 2012","A movie that is worth seeing,fast paced,entertainment,memorable quotes and personally one of the most incredible adventure - sci-fi movies  i ever ****'t miss it",9
"May 4, 2012","I had to get to the theater at 10:30 to get a seat for the midnight showing, and I sure wasn't the only one seeing the Avengers. Everywhere were people in Captain America masks, Thor helmets, or green faces for the Hulk. And when the lights dimmed, everyone began cheering as the movie started. And they cheered throughout it. And clapped. And laughed like crazy. The Avengers was SO MUCH FUN!!! Humorous, packed with action, with a fantastic cast and highlights for every one of them. Go see it. You'll never have so much fun at a movie. (And afterward, I high-fived a die-hard Hulk fan who had dyed himself completely **** can top that?)",9
"May 4, 2012","Is the AVENGERS the best super hero film of all time?  No, it's not. But it's a great film. Let's start with the surprising negative aspect: slow mid section and predictable storyline.  The positives: big spectacle film making at its best and a final action sequence that made Transformer's look like an incoherent mess.",9
"May 4, 2012","A dream come true. Good actor's performances, and a perfect mix of action and comedy make this film what every passionate about comics wanted. Best Marvel Movie",9
"May 4, 2012",i thought the movie combined all the strong points of the movies it was based on. i didn't think i could make it any better.,9
"May 4, 2012","The Avengers is not as good as The Dark Knight, I'm just going to say that from the off, the storyline is escapism and it has some genuinely funny moments in it, but it doesn't have the deep characters or visual spectacle. Joss Whedon's script keeps the film going, and lets be honest, this film could have been a train wreck. What makes The Avengers tick is the relationships that each of the characters have with one another. This is where the film really takes flight, when all the characters are in a pressure cooker together, it gives the film weight and suspense especially with Mark Ruffalo's Hulk. Joss Whedon should be given a lot of credit for crafting such a cohesive and well thought out script.

The film script is what keeps it above board, visuals have never been Joss Whedon's strong suit, but I did notice a wink to his first feature film Serenity in a zoom shot near the finale. The film doesn't look bad by any means it just has the same sheen that the other Marvel films seem to sport, but it had to be this way to fit all the heroes together. But lack of visual flair is sometimes what makes me dislike these movies, they look too clean and have a sheen that makes it look too cartoony for my personal taste. The Xmen films and Burton and Nolan's Batman films seem to not have these ""sheens"" to them, which make them visually more appealing to me.

I've also never been a fan of 3D even when it works superbly like in Avatar, its just a gimmick to make more money most of the time. So I'd recommend watching Avengers in 2D, as it doesn't add anything to the film being in that third dimension.

Its very difficult to score this film as it is by and large a fantastic superhero film, thats enjoyable from beginning to end. Is it as all engrossing and goose-bump inducing as The Dark Knight, well no. Is it better than Spiderman, well yes, but I was never a fan of Sam Raimi's Spiderman anyway. Is it better than Thor, enjoyment wise its about the same. With no back stories to get through in The Avengers the time certainly flies by, it is great summer film. Is it anything more than that, sorry Joss, no its not.",7
"May 4, 2012",Personally I really enjoyed iit.  The reason why I do not rely on critic reviews  (69 out 100 please).  Because they are just personal opinions like my own.  The movie was very entertaining.  I do agree about one thing though this was the best depiction of the Hulk since the TV series.,9
"May 4, 2012",We've been waiting for this movie a long time and it was worth it. Since iron man in 2008 we knew that an Avenger movie was coming. This is the best marvel movie so far and i have the chance to work in a movie theatre and I will have the chance to watch the movie over and over again!!!!,10
"May 4, 2012","Joss Whedon's Avengers is a funny, engaging and thrilling movie that stays true to the characters established in the previous Marvel movies. Great chemistry exists between the leads and you can tell they had a blast filming it. The story is a little too simplistic but other than that this movie is firing on all cylinders. What separates this from so many other superhero movies is that The Avengers has heart,  the rarest thing of all in a Hollywood blockbuster and something that is impossible to fake.",8
"May 4, 2012","An abundance of  exhilarating set-pieces , solid performances and a thoroughly engrossing emotional emphasis ensures that The Avengers stands tall as a marvel among superhero films .",10
"May 4, 2012","Great action flick, non-stop action, great lines, and I plan on seeing it again. Robert Downey, Jr steals the show as Iron Man. Stay for the credits to see the teaser for the next film! If you liked the Marvel films, you will love the Avengers.",10
"May 4, 2012","First of all, the story behind this film isn't exactly Oscar material. But the two hours and 20 minutes of non stop action and pure comic-book awesomeness definitely makes up for it. The comedy between the characters, the performances of old and new actors alike, this film is definitely worth a watch...",9
"May 4, 2012","The movie as whole is not bad but at the end of the day, it's pretty much the generic superhero/comic book movie - lots of explosions with some semi-funny one-liners. The action sequences were nothing outstanding (they were actually less impressive than the first scenes in Thor). On top of that, the movie is a bit slow until the half-way point. Some characters felt out of place like Scarlett Johansson's character and that Phil dude. Hulk's reason for being on the team was very blurry as well. Overall, an entertaining popcorn flick but nothing more.",5
"May 4, 2012","The Avengers is a musical arrangement that hits every note on pitch with all the class and excitement you'd expect with Tony Stark in the mix.  Joss Whedon takes the helm and crafts a masterpiece.  The characters are great, the script is amazing, the comedy is always perfect, and the action is breathtaking!  You won't find a better superhero movie or a comic adaptation.  The Avengers sets the bar high, and will be one of the main reasons 2012's summer movie release list will be memorable.",10
"May 4, 2012","Well the long awaited "" The Avengers"" does not disappoint.  From start to finish, the pace is fast, sometimes even brutal; with non-stop action and great moments of humor.  This mother of all sequels, being a sequel to no less than five films, brings together a multitude of powerhouse superheroes from the Marvel stable.  Even if you are not familiar with â",10
"May 4, 2012","I give this film 9/10. I'm dropping 1 point because they didn't exactly follow the original ""The Ulitmates"" story line, but came pretty damned close.

The film reflects Joss Whedons Humour with lots of nice humorous, but not out of place , quirky little moments. His wit is still very apparent from his Buffy/Angel/Firefly days. If it wasn't him who wrote the relevant scenes, it's someone trying to be like him !

The script and banter between everyone is snappy and everyone is already familiar with their roles so it's straight into the action. Everyone acted well and everyone took it seriously, but not TOO seriously.

I'm not giving away anymore plot than I already have in my opening statement, if you're familiar with the first 13 issue run of "" The Ultimates"" then you know roughly what's going on in the film. I should add here that you really end up hating Loki, again, what a great actor.

The films sounds amazing and looks even better, there is not a dull moment and I was thoroughly absorbed throughout. Lets have another one soon please.

And how about a Black Widow/Hawkeye spy/assassin flick in the mean time, they were both great characters incredibly well played by their respective actors.

Everyone already knows how good the actors that play Cap. America, Iron Man and Thor are, but those two mentioned above, and the chap that played the Hulk were also wonderful. As were the rest of the cast.

In order here's what I'd like to see next in the movies:-

New Iron Man, then a new Hulk, New Thor, New Cap. America, A Black Widow & Hawkeye spy story, with lots of Nick Fury in this one, THEN the second Avengers film. Then start the cycle again adding in a few other Avengers as time goes on. With the list above, and a film a year, that's a five year movie arc before it all starts again.

Now go and do it please people.

The Avengers, a solid nine out of ten. Go see it and enjoy.",9
"May 4, 2012","The Avengers is pure popcorn heaven for nerd and layman alike. Josh Whedon has created a witty, intelligent and action packed spectacle. The interaction between Thor, Bruce Banner, Tony Stark and Steve Rogers is as enthralling as the go-for-broke third act when Manhattan is laid to waste by Loki and his invading army. Worth the wait? Should you believe the hype? Does The Hulk steal the show? Yes, yes and yes. This is what a summer blockbuster should be.",9
"May 4, 2012",In my honest opinion this movie has the power of visuals from transformers and the epic story of avatar all in a incredible bundle of the greatest comic book story ever made. Those who don't like this movie have something very strange going on in their heads probably trolls or bullies hahaha this is officially my favorite movie of all times i will see it 3 times because its that good!!!,10
"May 4, 2012","Finally. First of all, the movie is amazing. You don't have to like really superheroes to like it. My GF never read a Marvel comic and she loved it. I don't blame her, this is the best superhero movie of all time (Nolan fans, shut up, TDK is NOT a superhero movie). Second of all, if a movie is released internationally a week earlier, you at metacritic should let users to review it. We all know sometimes people's opinions are better than some reviewers ones. I found stupid that the user critics were blocked until today. USA isn't the whole world, you know?

To the haters: Piss off.

To the lovers: ""Puny god""",10
"May 4, 2012","I just finished watching the midnight showing and I want to say that this movie is in my top three. It is definitely the best Marvel film yet. All of the characters get equal time on-screen and none are down played. The best parts about this movie were the action, hilarious comedy and of course, the Hulk.",10
"May 4, 2012","As usual, Iron Man steals the show but never expected humor coming from the Hulk in this one (Thor, The Cap, Agent Coulson, Loki all had their moments) . Story is well-written and acting is fairly good. Thor's acting is much improved over his previous outing. In my opinion the best superhero movie that combines humor and heart.",10
"May 4, 2012","AprÃ¨s des dÃbuts assez mitigÃs (de l'excellentissime Iron Man au mollasson Thor), les super-hÃros Marvel de ces derniÃ¨res annÃes mettent enfin le paquet. Et pas qu'un peu! De la part d'Avengers, on en attendait un dÃfouloir sympathique. A la place, nous avons droit Ã un chef-d'oeuvre d'action (rien que Ã§a), qui lorgne vers Transformers (pour le cÃ´tÃ explosif et gÃnÃreux), tout en le surpassant. MouvementÃ, hilarant (Stark et mention spÃciale Ã Hulk), Ãbouriffant, trÃ¨s bien jouÃ, effets spÃciaux sublimes, costumes... Bref, il n'y a rien Ã dire d'Avengers! Peut-Ãªtre que si : musiques pas si mÃmorables, et la barre a ÃtÃ mise tellement haute qu'on apprÃhende dÃjÃ comment va Ãªtre la suite. Mais vous voulez de vÃritables sensations fortes avec un blockbuster amÃricain qui ne se fout pas de la gueule des spectateurs, Avengers est le divertissement qu'il vous faut. Peut-Ãªtre mÃªme le meilleur entertainment de l'annÃe!",9
"May 4, 2012","The Avengers is the best Marvel film to date and quite possibly the best superhero movie I've seen in terms of all-out action spectacle, humor, and replay value. Tony Stark has so much more character development here than in the self-obsessed and flat Iron Man 2, it's nice to see Iron Man getting to do more intricate work aboard the helicarrier than just blowing stuff up. Chris' Evans and Hemsworth did an awesome job as the no-nonsense living legend super soldier and the huggable god of thunder respectively. Joss Whedon does an amazing job balancing the screen time for all the heroes and everyone gets their chance to shine, Black Widow and Hawkeye get to have their own complete story-arcs and S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury, Agent's Maria Hill and Coulson also had their moments and they took it well with the most pivotal scene of the film. But the big surprise is Mark Ruffalo who really steals the show as Dr Bruce Banner/Hulk, he's nailed down the relationship between the scientist and the big guy down to a T, and he has all of the funniest scenes in the Avengers.
Loved the first two acts, the first meet-up of the characters, the confrontations are all top draw but the highlights for me are the vocal interactions between everyone, whether it's between Stark/Banner, Stark/Cap, Coulson/Cap, Loki/Thor, Loki/Widow, Widow'Hawk and what have you is all perfect and I'd be more than happy if the movie would've been four hours long just to see them all bouncing off each other and that's all credit to the smart witty screenplay by Whedon. Every scene is so well made and the script compelling and essential to moving the plot forward, the most memorable moment for me was when Cap was putting on his suit while a Mozart-esque symphony is playing in the backdrop and loved all the pop culture references especially Stark's nickname for the Hawk. The final third of the movie is all-out mayhem and watching the team come together to save Manhattan from a never-ending wave of an alien race who-shall-not-be-named attacks is absolutely exhilarating and the one long continuous shot of all the Avengers in the heat of battle is captivating. It proves the point of how character build-up and the tension watching our superheroes fight and play-off each other in the first two acts and have the final battle in context can make for a more engaging and extraordinary spectacle than just mindlessly blowing things up because you have to. It's the best action set-piece I've ever seen and it's so over the top in an amazing way. When you walk out of the cinema I promise your craving for a very well made superhero movie that's not dumbed down and at the same time not as gritty and dark will be satiated. It's pure indulgence.",10
"May 4, 2012",Whedon  did best for this movie.Such a great and unforgettable adventure.With outstanding action scenes(better and clear than Michael Bay's Transformers)delicate sense of humor and touchable **** best movie in the marvel and Marvel Universe **** point is 100+++,10
