2025-01-10,"The Avengers is the most enjoyable time I've spent with the MCU so far.

It operates with established characters, but they still have character arcs and those are surprisingly very satisfying. Obviously I kind of knew what's going to happen, but that didn't take away a bit from the enjoyment. There were a few moments where I was shocked or didn't know how the story would move forward. The dialogues sometimes feel a little out of place, but are mostly good.

The visual effects have never been this good in the MCU so far, I loved that. I also love the huge cast, although I was sad to see one of my favourite actors, Stellan Skarsgård turned into a villain, alongside Jeremy Renner. The cinematography is great, but the movie is a little too long, so I'm not the biggest fan of the editing. The acting performances are good for a superhero movie.

The Avengers is an amazing culmination to the first phase of the MCU.",9,2025-01,Friday,"acting:0.08, actors:0.09, also:0.07, although:0.11, amazing:0.07, an:0.06, and:0.03, are:0.16, avengers:0.09, away:0.11, been:0.07, biggest:0.11, bit:0.10, but:0.17, cast:0.08, character:0.07, characters:0.05, didn:0.16, effects:0.07, enjoyable:0.10, fan:0.08, far:0.17, feel:0.09, few:0.09, first:0.07, for:0.04, from:0.06, going:0.08, good:0.16, great:0.05, have:0.10, how:0.07, huge:0.10, in:0.04, into:0.08, is:0.13, it:0.03, jeremy:0.11, kind:0.10, know:0.09, little:0.17, long:0.09, love:0.08, loved:0.09, mcu:0.30, moments:0.09, most:0.07, movie:0.06, my:0.06, never:0.08, not:0.05, obviously:0.11, of:0.16, one:0.05, or:0.07, out:0.07, performances:0.11, place:0.11, renner:0.11, see:0.06, so:0.17, still:0.08, story:0.06, superhero:0.06, take:0.10, that:0.08, the:0.44, there:0.06, they:0.06, this:0.03, those:0.09, time:0.06, to:0.10, too:0.08, ve:0.08, very:0.06, villain:0.08, visual:0.10, was:0.09, were:0.07, what:0.06, where:0.09, with:0.09, would:0.07"
2024-09-09,"The culmination of Marvel's four-year, five-picture initial phase is, puzzlingly, both as good as I'd hoped and mildly disappointing. The Avengers excels at playing up the story's larger-than-life aspects, from the heroes' testy initial relationships to the looming magnitude of the threat they're called together to face. Such moments are dispersed liberally, perhaps once every five minutes, and they're an effective method of keeping the audience on the hook for the duration.

What's missing, at least from where I sit, is a measure of substance or depth behind those fireworks. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent once again, in his nuanced interpretation of the paradoxical Tony Stark, and Mark Ruffalo might just be the best Hulk ever to grace the silver screen, but by comparison the rest of the cast feels quite thin, shallow and (for lack of a better word) cartoonish. Captain America, for example, wears a completely different personality than he did in his solo picture, and never quite fits as the commanding field general he's meant to be. The most intriguing aspect of his character, an emotional detachment from modern culture, is barely even mentioned. He, and the rest of the team, feels like a suit of armor with a few good one-liners, not a living, breathing human being. That trap was mostly evaded in the stars' preceding solo shots, so it's a shame to see it tripped here, especially given the amount of time and effort that was expended to define each set of personal motivations.

Those nitpicks certainly aren't enough to stop me from enjoying the closest thing we'll ever get to an all-splash-page crossover mega-event on the big screen, but they're also irritating enough to keep tickling the back of my mind while the next set of fuses are lit.

The scale of it, the number of superheros, the CGI. I honestly believed this movie was the peak of superhero movies and that nothing will ever beat it. In retrospective, I was of course wrong... Fortunately.

Not only is this movie very good on its own, but the fact that there was a build-up to it from the previous movies that also established our main characters makes it even better.

I was expecting wall-to-wall action, pretty much from the start - especially given the forces that join together. However, I felt the first half of 'The Avengers' as slow. What also didn't help is that the villain, carried over from a preceding MCU film, isn't super interesting - we also don't see the antagonist's earlier film counterpart for a fair few scenes, which felt too delayed.

The last half is much better, which allowed me to enjoy myself properly. Robert Downey Jr., while not as entertaining as he is on his own, brings goodness, as do the likes of Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth.

I'm not a big fan of recasts, though Mark Ruffalo as Hulk is a positive one; even if that took a bit away from the novelty of all the superheroes joining, given we hadn't seen Ruffalo himself before. Added to Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, at least in terms of the film franchise, getting major screen time out of nowhere - having been a bit part character in her debut MCU appearance.

Those are my favorite moments of this movie. Scenes like Tony talking to Bruce about how the Hulk saved his life, Steve and Coulson chatting on the way to the helicarrier and Steve and Tony arguing about sacrifice (something which will be payed off in Endgame).

It's simple. You take a bunch of characters I like and put them in a room together. That's what most of this movie is and that's why I like it so much. The action is great and all, but it's those little moments that keep me returning.

Also, the scene with Loki in Germany is one of the best scenes in all of the MCU.

Especially ingenious in how Marvel managed to connect all the superheroes nicely and make a film about them. The work was probably not easy to make a movie with so many superheroes, but it worked.

2020-07-01,"This to me is still the best Marvel movie ever. Joss Whedon perfectly manages a large group of charasmatic characters with big egos played by an amazing cast of actors. After phase 1 we are treated to this incredible, inspired battle royale. The mischievous Loki (Hiddleston) with some mysterious influence attacks New York with a galactic army of Aliens. Good thing sassy Iron Man played by an amazing Robert Downey Jr., mega hunky with inspired comic timing Thor (Hemsworth), sexy Hawkeye (Renner), the fierce Hulk (Ruffalo) and gorgeous all American boy Captain America (Evans). But the real scene stealer here is a kick ass, smart, fantastically executed Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson. The movie is definitely one of the best of it's kind as well as being one of the most entertaining ever made.

2020-04-19,"Uma das melhores junções de heróis já feitas, com momentos épicos e uma atmosfera única.

Diversos elementos nesse filme funcionam muito bem. Temos personagens que, por si só, já são interessantes e carismáticos, e esse até então não era o desafio. Acontece que o roteiro sabe muito bem como conduzir a visão de cada um sem que isso parecesse forçado, na realidade, até se acrescenta ao personagem. Isso fica muito mais evidente para quem assistiu os filmes subsequentes e percebe muito bem referências que são, na realidade, futuras a trama. Loki é super carismático e fez com que amássemos o odiar, ocupando perfeitamente o papel do vilão. O início da relação entre o Cap. América e Tony Stark é no mínimo intrigante, e cada um parece ter sua verdade em determinados momentos.

Se tem uma coisa que funciona bem aqui é o alívio cômico. Nos pega em momentos certeiros, são bem engraçados e quebra o clima pesado - que não é o propósito do filme. As cenas de luta são boas de modo geral, com claro destaque aquelas onde o plano é mais aberto e se utilizam dois ou mais heróis, combinando seus poderes; é lindo e extremamente satisfatório de se ver.

CONS: it's necessary to have watched the films 'Ironman', 'Ironman 2', 'Captain America: The First Avenger', 'The Incredible Hulk' and 'Thor', or at least watched a youtube summary of each of them, to be able to understand and comprehend the story completely; the concept of super-heroes having to save the Earth from invading alien foes is not exactly original.

The Avengers

Whedon is much better a writer than he is a director. On a scale of McQuarrie, disappointingly Joss Whedon, the director, wouldn't even qualify as one. For when it comes to map the ever longed battles by the fans, he takes things lightly a lot. Whatever glory that bedazzles you on the screen, is a pure feat of bravery on paper not on screen. Too much cheese and too much sweet, his self-earned jaw dropping moments, are spoiled by him by the bitter afterbirth of his fandom. Fortunately, these battles are here as the starters, the main course is the ""build-up"" to that battle.

Whether then you watch gleefully these characters argue egotistically or see a train of awe-gasping moves by them to overpower each other on screen. There lies a profound poetry between these moments where you can see 8 year old Whedon playing with his toys in his room, creating banal engaging scenarios between Captain and Tony. This crowd pleasing franchise saw the maybe-expected uplift from this chapter, as it managed to bring out every adored content, from humor to drama to juicy visual effects. The dollars were written in the script and so it was visible on screen.

Among all the triumphs of Whedon, his biggest is combining these behemoth figures and weave out a compelling conversation that is worth ten times any battle shown. Downey is the singular actor that comes out with a sigh, his performance isn't interfered by the intertwining of multiple plots, which it seems like it did to others.

2018-09-19,"The Avengers is the first team-up film in the MCU and follows the crew as they argue for a while before teaming up to fight some aliens that are invading Earth thanks to Loki opening up a portal. Even when I watched The Avengers for the first time back in 2012, I didn't think that the story was all that special. This is a long film, and for most of it we just sit around watching the heroes talk. There are a few action set pieces throughout the film, such as when Thor, Loki, and Iron Man (and Captain America) have a pretty awesome scuffle, but besides that it's a whole lot of chatter and not a whole lot of anything else. And it doesn't help that these conversations aren't particularly interesting. The final battle in the city is cool, but there's nothing particularly jaw-dropping about it either. The story here is just...okay. I will say that having watched the first Captain America film it was cool to see Steve interact with the son of a man that he considered a friend, and slowly realize that he's a bit of a ****. Steve and Tony's dynamic is by far the most entertaining in the film (and possibly the MCU, which makes sense given the future these two have). As to be expected by this point with MCU films, the cinematography is great. Of course, this is also the film where we get the iconic shot of The Avengers as they assemble on the battlefield, which was cool to see. In the end, though, while everything in this film is solid, I don't find it to be particularly mind-blowing. And really a big part of the reason why I don't like to watch this one very often is because of the long run-time. There's nothing in this film that makes me want to sit down for 2.5 hours and watch it, unless I'm doing an MCU marathon.",7,2018-09,Wednesday,"2012:0.06, about:0.04, action:0.03, all:0.03, also:0.04, america:0.09, an:0.03, and:0.18, anything:0.06, are:0.06, around:0.06, as:0.12, avengers:0.08, awesome:0.05, back:0.06, battle:0.06, be:0.06, because:0.04, before:0.05, big:0.05, bit:0.06, but:0.05, by:0.08, captain:0.09, cool:0.18, course:0.06, didn:0.05, doesn:0.05, don:0.09, down:0.06, earth:0.06, either:0.06, else:0.06, end:0.05, entertaining:0.05, even:0.04, everything:0.05, expected:0.06, far:0.05, few:0.05, fight:0.06, film:0.23, films:0.04, final:0.06, find:0.06, first:0.12, for:0.10, get:0.04, given:0.06, great:0.03, have:0.06, having:0.06, he:0.09, here:0.05, heroes:0.04, hours:0.06, in:0.16, interesting:0.06, iron:0.04, is:0.18, it:0.13, just:0.07, like:0.03, loki:0.08, long:0.10, lot:0.09, makes:0.10, man:0.07, mcu:0.23, me:0.04, mind:0.06, most:0.08, not:0.03, nothing:0.11, of:0.16, on:0.03, one:0.03, part:0.05, point:0.06, possibly:0.07, pretty:0.05, really:0.04, reason:0.06, say:0.05, see:0.07, sense:0.06, set:0.06, solid:0.06, some:0.04, special:0.04, story:0.07, such:0.05, team:0.05, that:0.22, the:0.40, there:0.11, these:0.10, they:0.07, think:0.05, this:0.12, thor:0.04, though:0.05, throughout:0.06, time:0.07, to:0.15, tony:0.05, two:0.06, up:0.11, very:0.04, want:0.05, was:0.08, watch:0.08, watched:0.12, watching:0.05, we:0.10, when:0.08, where:0.05, which:0.09, while:0.10, whole:0.11, why:0.06, will:0.04, with:0.05"

While this film has some good performances from all the actors involved and Tom Hiddleston stands out in this cast for his portrayal of Loki in this film. There is also other aspects which I like, including the one take sequence that happens in the final battle. However, this film has too much going on, it tries to focus on too much in this film, the different aspects include, the heroes working together in team, they also try to establish character arcs for some characters but not for others. The third and final thing which this film does is that it tries to establish a political stand point about teaming the avengers and this results in the film having too much going on.

But walking out of the theater, all I felt was that I had seen 2.5 hours of nothing but action and drama. Maybe that's its purpose? Maybe it's just not my cup of tea? For whatever reason, I was not invested. This is hardly an interesting or exciting film, and I see no reason for the rave reviews or exceptional $$ it is making.

I suppose it has something to do with being a ""fan""; as I said earlier, I am in no way a ""fan"" of hero movies but this one got such good reviews that I had to check it out.

2017-11-27,"A great superhero film classic. It has the perfect mix **** dynamic and fun humor. Truth be told, I prefer DC over Marvel, but there is no denying the true comic book essence and masterfulness of The Avengers. The movie was hyped a lot over the course of a couple of years or so,with tons of trailers and teasers in the individual character films in Phase 1 of the MCU, and to most people, especially comic book fans, this movie does not disappoint. Great characters, a great villain and epic action sequences make it a winner. And any true Marvel fan or comic book fan in general will start feeling that little kid in them start to jump up and down with glee at the end when the Avengers team up to save the city. I have seen a lot of reviewers here criticize the movie for having a bland or simplistic plot, but you have to remember that this movie is a direct adaptation of the Avengers origin story from the comics, which was written back in 1963, when the concept of superheroes coming together to save the planet was not considered a ""thin plot"".

2017-09-13,"With The Avengers, Joss Whedon had the impossible task of taking four different franchises with loose connective tissue, and bringing them all together for a massive superhero team-up adventure. And my word, does he pull it off. In fact, he absolutely nails it. These characters, as different as they are, feel like they belong together in this movie. The talent of the actors portraying them, paired with Whedon's witty dialogue, makes for excellent banter.

The movie actually gets off to a rocky start, with the first five minutes or so feeling oddly cheap, but after the title card comes up, it's an absolute blast from beginning to end. This film provided me with one of the best theater-going experiences I've ever had, and even after watching it upwards to 20 times at home, it has never gotten old.

The characters are great. The action is mind-blowing. There's tons of heart. It might not be the deepest examination of these characters that we've ever seen, but this is what blockbuster filmmaking is all about.

2017-06-01,"Quando foi anunciado que o filme seria dirigido por Joss Whedon,os fás ficaram com expectativas baixas em relação ao diretor e o jugaram não merecedor de um filme dessa importância dentro do universo marvel,afinal foram anos de espera para que finalmente pudesse se ver os heróis mais poderosos da terra juntos,as expectativas foram baixas mas o filme foi lançado e junto com ele as más línguas foram calada,afinal o filme foi um sucesso,os que desacreditavam começaram a acreditar,os nerds foram a loucura,as redes sócias só falavam disso,pelo simples motivo de vingadores ser um dos melhores filmes da expansão do universo cinematográfico da marvel até hoje,superando até mesmo sua estimada sequencia.

o filme que é dirigido e roteirizado por um fã e escritor de quadrinhos tem um estilo própio e se diferencia da maioria dos blockbusters,afinal o filme é lotado de referencias a cultura geek temos Shakespeare, O Senhor dos Anéis, Stephen Hawking entre varias outras espalhadas pelo filme,alem do tom comico encaixar perfeitamente no estilo de trama apresentado.
Thor: He’s my brother.

Natasha Romanoff: He killed 80 people in 2 days.

Thor: …He’s adopted.

O filme também não se preocupa em mostrar a origem,motivações,habilidades de cada membro afinal isso já tinha sido mostrado aõ longo dos anos,oque deixa muito mais espaço para que se possa produzir uma trama original e objetiva,e nisso o filme é perfeito,em 2:10 de filme,Whedon consegue nos apresentar muita coisa sem em nenhum momento o enredo ficar cansativo ou massante,alem de ele saber muito bem como desenvolver cada personagem perfeitamente sem deixar outro de lado,isso é uma coisa admirável,em um filme de um grupo de super heróis com 6 membros,era de se esperar que pelo menos um deles ficasse como personagem secundário ou não tivesse nenhuma relevância na **** cenas de ação utilizam muito bem o elemento de trabalho em equipe e as características próprias de cada personagem,tudo isso realçado por um dos melhores vilões do universo cinematográfico da marvel,afinal loki(Tom Hiddleston) se mostra tudo oque ele tinha que ser,persuativo,arrogante e carismático,conseguindo carregar com maestria o papel de vilão de uma equipe formada pelos seres mais poderosos da terra.Adicione frases marcantes,Diálogos bem construídos,um enredo espetacular e você terá o filme,não tem como ser ruim

Apesar de o filme ter alguns poucos erros de continuidade e timing,eles nunca Sobrepõem as suas qualidades,afinal o filme cumpre o trabalho de mostrar uma equipe de super-heróis e consegue com perfeição dar a profundidade e desenvolvimento necessário pra cada um.

There are too many main characters to keep up with, all of which are underdeveloped, so the entire movie you feel like there is something you're out of the loop about.

2016-07-29,"A feast for Fanboys and FX aficionados. BUT, the story is a mess and much like Whedon's Cabin in the Woods, snarky Whedonesque dialogue cannot liven up the first hour, nor focus the last hour of ADD CG puppet theater.

Marvel's Avengers does have some redeeming qualities, the Archetypal Superhero Vs. Archetypal Superhero fights. In classic coming book fanboy fashion, we're treated to mini grudge matches between our protagonists before the penultimate battle with Norse god Loki and a host of generic alien invaders. But, this film isn't Fight Club, it's just a love letter to the Sheldon Coopers of the world and that doesn't make it a top shelf BluRay, like Watchmen.

On the bright side, Marvel's Avengers is the precursor to the emerging technology of photo-realistic CG. No less than three major FX shops and a host of smaller shops worked on this film. ILM, Weta and Digital Domain put a lot of love into this film and it shows. Also, though not shot in 3D, the conversion is top notch, much better than other celluloid conversions such as The Phantom Menace and Thor.

Whedon's film is fun, the way that a Theme Park ride is fun, don't expect Shakespeare in the Park. I give it three stars, but just barely.

The Avengers is like a dream come true and I mean that in the truest sense of the phrase. But for me it less because of the superhero team-up movie aspect, but more so for that fact that the writer/director behind the superhero team-up movie is Joss Whedon. I remember when this movie was coming out and it was announced that Whedon was on board to write and direct and my response was: ""yeah, sure he is. I'll believe that when I see it,"" I have seen it (five times now) and it's great!

We're used to seeing multiple heroes on screen now but back in 2012 it was something special to see superheroes team up to kick ass, although granted the X-Men (who are technically mutants not superheroes I know but same difference) had been doing this since 2000, this was the Avengers, a wholly different kettle of fish.

As a superhero film, this pretty much ticks all the boxes. Incredibly fun, action packed topped with great humour.

The cast was amazing with Tom Hiddleston getting a honourable mention as the primary antagonist, Loki. He was great in Thor, however in this film, he really took the spotlight. A great villain and a great reason to bring Earth's Mightiest Heroes together.

Every character played their part well, with Captain America and Iron Man being my favourite heroes. Ruffalo played a great Bruce Banner/Hulk and I'm excited to see him in future instalments.

The dialogue wasn't the greatest, however it suited the genre and tone of the film.

Marvel Studios unveils its costliest special-effects demo to date; somewhere beneath the nonstop digital explosions lies a story about superheroes fighting an evil demigod from space. Every now and then, director Joss Whedon (Serenity) executes a quirky camera set-up to assert that the film was created by him and not a team of marketing executives.

2016-03-14,"WHAT I LIKE: 'The Avengers' defines the comic book movie. It's explosive, fun, action packed, pop-corn entertainment taken to the next level. The feeling of seeing the characters you love, interact for the first time can never be repeated. The confrontations, the jokes, the teamwork, it all feels so real. How? Well, the acting is class A stuff, but Whedon's direction here is nothing short of amazing - it gives the movie heart. Really, it's a wonder it doesn't collapse under it's own weight. But but thanks to a mix of smart writing and exciting action it really, really doesn't; Whedon recognises the equal importance of some great scenes without all that fighting to ground the team dynamic and character relationships. So thankfully their dynamics are pegged perfectly, the tone of the humour and lightheartedness overall is well done, and the new characters are all great too. Oh, and that final action scene just makes it. Wow.
WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Some bits are a teeny bit cringe-worthy if I'm honest like the goofy costumes, cheesy lines and the odd bit of bad CGI. But it arguably adds to it's ballsy comic book charm.

2016-03-13,"La película era la más esperaba luego de ver a sus protagonistas de forma individual, pero verlos juntos en una misma cinta, era algo que nunca se hizo jamás, me la vi, y simplemente era todo lo que esperaba de algo tan innovador, la disfruté muy bien de principio a fin, toda la trama se entralaza con las previas entregas de Marvel Studios y como los distintos personajes aprendían a trabajar en equipo para enfrentar a un mal masivo, la acción evoluciona mientras la película avanza, en la parte de la batalla final, me sentí como si volviera a tener 10 años, jamás una película me hizo sentir de esa manera, esta hizo a un lado las películas de los Transformers por mucho, en cuanto al elenco, todos han vuelto a hacer una buena interpretación de sus personajes y estos han progresado desde sus últimas apariciones, la Viuda Negra ha tenido más relevancia, se ha dado a conocer un poco de su historia, Mark Ruffalo como Bruce Banner y Hulk, le hace genial, supera por mucho a Edward Norton, no digo que Norton sea malo, pero Ruffalo hace un Banner casi parecido al que solía hacer el desaparecido Bill Bixby, aunque también me gustó con su álter ego verde, hasta el diseño de este es el mejor logrado y más realista de todos, hasta en la cara se parece a al de Ruffalo, me gustó que la historia de la peli estuviera basada en el número 1 de 1963 y The Ultimates, razón por que Loki vuelve a ser antagonista en esta película y lo hace bien y mejor, pero en mi caso no llega a quitarle protagonismo a los héroes, para terminar la película no me gustó, me encantó, tiene mucha acción en lo que dura la cinta, buena trama y todos los héroes tiene un protagonismo equilibrado, nadie opaca al otro, sin duda alguna se ha convertido en una de las mejores de Marvel, con un éxito tanto en crítica y público y la razón por qué ahora otros estudios de cine quieren hacer sus universos compartidos, pero nadie se va a comparar con Marvel que lo hizo primero con años de planeamiento y un gran elenco de actores que dan vida en esta franquicia, Joss Whedon ha conseguido dirigir y escribir una gran historia, la admiración de muchos por esta película que ha hecho historia en la cultura popular.",10,2016-03,Sunday,"10:0.02, banner:0.05, bruce:0.02, de:0.57, en:0.40, final:0.03, hulk:0.01, individual:0.03, joss:0.02, la:0.53, loki:0.02, mark:0.02, marvel:0.04, me:0.11, no:0.05, por:0.16, que:0.28, ruffalo:0.06, se:0.18, the:0.01, transformers:0.03, un:0.21, una:0.15, whedon:0.02"

Of course this movie's action is epic in all the right places and each hero gets there time to shine (once again, for the most part). While I do have minor gripes such as Captain America's costume looking silly and corny (unlike the other films he appears in) and Hawkeye's role in the film, this movie still delivers on each and every promise it made. We get to see interesting conflict between the famous heroes and see them throw-down side by side in very well done action set-pieces. One particular sequence deserves high praise, in which it pans through all the heroes fighting the aliens which threaten the planet, starting from Black Widow to Hawkeye to Captain America and Iron-Man and finally the mighty tag-team of Hulk and Thor.

It came out at the same time as The Dark Knight Rises and seemingly was thought by many to be the better movie, something I completely disagree with. The Avengers was entertaining but that was about it, this movie is clearly targeted for kids and young adults as the less than stellar pacing, clichéd dialogue and cookie cutter plot that I felt crippled the film in almost every way. I get that its a superhero movie, but that doesn't make up for how painfully sloppy this film was to me.

For full disclosure, I should comment that I was kind of confused for a lot of it, because I haven't seen any of the Thor movies, but I recognize that it's my fault I had trouble following.  The air ships and seeing more inside of Shield was great, especially because it meant more Samuel L. Jackson.  Loki is a really great villain which makes it fun to watch, although I knew I was missing a lot because I didn't know the back story about his relationship with Thor, except what I'd been told by my moviepartner.

The scenes where all the Avengers are together tend to have a fun dynamic, just because of all the banter and disagreements between the characters.

2015-05-03,"I was afraid that not having seen any of the individual movies (yes, I am a tad ashamed) would pose a problem while watching 'The Avengers', but there really was no room for fear. 'The Avengers' were certainly a test for Marvel's Cinematic Universe, a test about whether they can pull such a movie (i.e. a blend of several before-released individual movies with an ensemble cast that acts as the main character, rather than each of the individual heroes themselves), and it did not go unnoticed. But, despite the visibly pulled brake, 'The Avengers' were exceptionally fun. The chemistry between the cast members (although I was sad not to see Ed Norton) was absolutely brilliant and they actually elevated their individual roles from the earlier movies to a completely new level. The plot was more-less consistent and not the least boring, and it actually all of the future installments quite nicely. Also, the puns were great, the humor in general, actually and you really did enjoy those funny moments and replicas between all that **** scenes. What I also liked is that 'The Avengers' never tried to simulate any depth; it was meant to be a fun action movie with all those lovable superheroes fighting together, being awesome and trashing stuff in order to crush the bad guys - and it was. They never tried to be something they weren't and they certainly did a brilliant job.

I was not disappointed, pretty much everything that was in this movie was pretty much all I expected to see and I'm happy with that.

'The Avengers' focuses on Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) trying to cope with Loki (Tom Hiddleston) taking the tesseract and using it against the world. Loki makes allies Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) his two new muses. Fury decides that it's time to assemble some of earth's mightiest superheroes, The Avengers.

We see Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) reluctantly join as he thought that he could not qualify. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) joins because he is a World War II veteran, so his inner self says that he has to save the world. We also see Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) not hiding anymore after his little incidents.

We also see agents Natasha Romonoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) return and convince each of the guys to try and stop Loki.

Obviously after the events in 'Thor' (2011), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) returns as he still has unfinished business with his brother Loki and what he plans to do with the tesseract.

This movie moves at such an entertaining pace and I have been waiting years to finally see it, four years to be specific, since the release of 'Iron Man' (2008), all I wanted to see is four Marvel heroes unite in their ultimate movie. Seeing this movie in the cinema back in 2012 was an absolute treat.

The action is pretty much similar to the ""Transformers"" movies, but they are cleaner and have purpose and style, unlike the ones in the ""Transformers"" franchise where it's just a technological mess and they were gimmicks.

Director Joss Whedon ('Buffy The Vampire Slayer' and 'Firefly') clearly respects the Marvel comics enough to make a coherent story and visually appealing action.

Joss Whedon really pulled out all the stops when it came to directing a movie as big as this, and it shows. The entire ensemble cast was pitch-perfect, the action sequences were incredibly immersive and highly entertaining, and the dialogue was absolutely hilarious when it needed to be. I also loved the interactions between every one of the characters. Seeing them meet each other for the first time was both amazingly surreal and surprisingly realistic. Nearly everything from the score to the special effects to the comic timing just felt right. The Avengers is quite simply an experience that everyone should see.

Joss Whedon clearly has a love and understanding of these characters and the source material. He collaborates all of these stars to perfection and balances their screen time effortlessly. His overall direction is solid and all of the set pieces are thoroughly enjoyable. The final act in particular is unbelievable and incredibly crowd pleasing. The whole cast is strong but Robert Downey Jr. is the standout as Iron Man. Tom Hiddleston is as equally superb as villain Loki, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow & Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury have much more involvement and most surprisingly Mark Ruffalo is a welcome recasting as the Hulk. Chris Evans & Chris Hemsworth are both strong also and have grown into their characters Captain America & Thor respectively. However my only minor criticism is Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye. Personally I didn't like the way his character was developed throughout the film until the final act. And I hope his character has the chance to shine in future releases. But otherwise as a lifelong fan of these characters I was both pleasantly surprised and incredibly satisfied. The Avengers caters for everybody, it's action packed, full of humour and it will please fan boys and newcomers alike.

Batman or Spiderman movies have so much more emotional content and lasting impact, just to give two examples. The thing that should be unquestionable is the great visual effects, but even that becomes not that impressive only a year later, when we had in 2013 several blockbusters doing it better and bigger, especially Star Trek into Darkness and Man of Steel (the most epic action in a super hero movie to date).

2013-10-06,"I had been waiting to watch this movie, as it looked cool enough. I mean; Iron Man, the Hulk, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye teaming up to fight aliens? Awesome! Unfortunately, the first 45 minutes are kinda boring. I mean what good superhero movie starts with a pretty boring car chase and bland dialogue/scripts? I personally think it's pretty overrated. Cliched, predictable and shallow. I liked Loki though and liked the superheros fighting aliens.

However, there's also a lot of mistakes with the plot. For example, while Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America are fighting, they leave Loki, their supervillain prisoner unattended. Also, SHIELD's entire Heli-Carrier is almost destroyed by one freaking arrow. All of The Avengers talk and pretend to have ear pieces even though they don't have any. Also, the Chitauri are nothing like they are in the comics. (And there's that annoying bickering between characters...) Overall, I expected much better from Marvel.

2013-08-23,"The Avengers  at first  dissapointed me, but it grew on me. The film gradually builds up from being boring and full of emotionless events and non-exciting action to an extremely exciting climax, the middle of the film was suspence filled build up to the climax near the end. The near-end climax of the story and action did not dissapoint me, as it was one of the most exciting group of scenes in all movies. The acting and character building was great in this film; although the story wasn't the best, it was pretty darn good and certainly kept me watching  but the story wasn't the only thing keeping me watching... The action was non-stop and incredibly exciting throughout the last 50 minutes, it made me smile to see all of the characters work together to save the citizens of New York  and, well, the world.
Although The Avengers starts blandly and boringly, it gradually builds up to an incredibly exciting climax; The Avengers may not be the best super hero film I've seen, but it's still very good and definetely deserves to be watched around the world.

Jeremy Renner, didn't know him until this movie. Damn. And what can I say about Mark Ruffalo? Best damn Bruce Banner portrayal since Lou Ferigno. WELL done! The plot was fluid, it made sense, it was engaging, gripping and didn't lose my attention at all.

2013-06-16,"In the decade it's taken to bring everything together, we've continually been promised that the Avengers would be the superhero movie to change all superhero movies and it's a damn good thing, because I really hate superhero movies. Three things made this film standout and shine over the many, many superhero films that have been released. The most obvious thing is the huge, superstar, cast. Not only is it incredibly difficult to bring a cast like this together, but to get them to work together, without getting in each others way must have been nearly impossible. Second, even though the film involves superheroes and outer space, it seems somewhat realistic to us. These heroes have families, personalities, feelings, people get hurt, and some people even die, letting us see the human side of these characters. Finally, the Direction of Joss Whedon brings it all together. Whedon has always had this unique ability to put his own style on spin on things, at first it seems strange, but ultimately we come to love it. He is such an underrated Director, who brings so much to everything he's a part of, and it's great to see him get to do a huge project like this. The Avengers was special, not only because it took a decade to make, but because if you saw all the individual movies first, like I did, you feel a connection to these guys, it's almost like you know them personally and you expect them to act in certain ways when they all come together. The individual films really built up the excitement and helped the Avengers to become a billion dollar earner at the box office.

2013-05-30,"I'm not gonna lie, this movie was absolutely amazing! Also, if I'm being completely honest, I went in assuming it would be another highly overrated superhero movie that couldn't like up to the hype. It definitely wouldn't be the first time I disagreed with the critics. Boy was I mistaken. Outside of the films from Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, this is easily the best superhero movie ever made. They plot developed perfectly, the action sequences were incredible, there were a lot of unexpectedly humorous scenes and dialogue, and the characters and actors were all great. One of my concerns going in was how they would possibly give each character their fair shake. Well the great Joss Whedon did a great job keeping a perfect balance between staying true to the individual characters while further introducing a developing Black Widow and Hawkeye. Another thing, Mark Ruffalo did a marvelous job as Bruce Banner. A lot of people were worried about him in that role and were upset about the change from Edward Norton. Maybe it's because I'm biased and loathe Norton but I thought Ruffalo did a better job as Banner. I wouldn't have minded them focusing a little more time on the Hawkeye character and I wouldn't have minded if they actually squeezed in Natalie Portman's character for a quick scene or two but the movie really didn't need it.

At over 2 hours and 20 minutes, it is wholly captivating, perfectly balancing character development, team development (which is critical for this movie) and eye-popping 3D action. This is no small feat, bringing together the six ""heroes."". Even the minor characters are brought to the forefront (Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye and Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, for example), enriching their characters and making their action sequences just as cool and dynamic.

And surprisingly, it is the best Hulk movie. There are two scenes featuring the Hulk that will have you laughing so hard you'll be in tears. You'd think Iron Man would have the coolest action sequences, but when the Hulk inflicts carnage on the enemies, you don't want it to stop.

My personal favorites in this movie were Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man and Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk. Robert Downey, Jr. brought back more of his sarcastic and witty comments that make him the best character in the movie. However, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner was just incredible. He played the part very well. As for the Hulk, he was awesome.

I also have to applaud the other cast members (Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Scarlett Johannsenn, Jeremy Renner). They all did very well in their respective roles and I felt that Loki was a very good villain.

The result was not only a blast, but also led to more adaptations, including the coveted 'Spiderman' walked many years ago stuck in an economically unviable Study (Carolco) and promoters like James Cameron who remained in the way.
They know how to count and give casual joke humorous, sad not like Michael Bay attempts to do so. The performances are really good by the entire cast, especially that of Tom Hiddleston, is really good and hae see Loki's character as a great and dangerous villain of comic books, and my opinion much deserved every award nomination.
The visual effects and uncountable stages are really amazing, definitely an Oscar nomination in this.
What I did not like was that it is very predictable, so I tend to like movies, I like movies when something unexpected happens, but here there was exepcion, also becomes longer and that can be very annoying as the movie.
Nearly two hours of footage, and how difficult was entertained. In the end it was hard not to. Not drops, not weakens and does not disappoint, with all the spectacular and the technique allows exploiting the potential in each frame which was holding. If you had to hang a picture next to the term 'blockbuster popping' the heroes traveling on the streets of New York would be the ideal.

'The Avengers' have joined. They do not separate the precipitated sequels.

2013-02-19,"This film is not as good as everyone said it was. It is quite bland, seemed somewhat lifeless and was backed up by a lacking storyline. But, it was quite good fun; despite the problems I had with the story, the acting was of a pretty high standard from most of the cast, particularly from the main antagonist of the film, who was creepy, strong and weak at all the right times, perhaps a little stale at times however. The music was forgettable, the action was good, but not outstanding, and even though every character got a good amount of time in the limelight, it felt like Iron Man and Black Widow's film. The film is very conventionally shot, no nice camera tricks or spectacular shots appeared in the movie, this is not so much a negative of the film: but it certainly could have been better.

2013-01-09,"My main concern with The Avengers was, in encompassing all of the members, the film would be spread too thinly between the characters, resulting in a watered down attempt to integrate characters and personalities, a little like the X-men films. Thankfully this is not the case, although it's interesting that co-writer Zak Penn was involved in two of the X-men group films. Penn and Joss Whedon find enough screen-time for all the Avengers and by introducing them gradually through the film's opening third, sufficient emphasis is placed on each character. Similarly, I was disappointed when I discovered that the film's antagonist would be Loki, as I was not overly impressed with him in Thor. Again though, due to Hiddlestone's improved performance this time around and with Whedon's direction, I felt Loki was a much more interesting villain and one more fitting of the collective's film.

The team dynamic of between the superheroes is what really makes the film, alongside the blockbuster action sequences. Thor and Hulk clash, Captain America and Tony Stark routinely throw barbs at each other while Stark shows a surprisingly sincere side when offering support to Bruce Banner. Mark Ruffalo plays Banner with a sense of fear and regret of his destructive, uncontrollable power and I found him to be the most interesting character of the team. There's a slightly contrived back-story thrown in to give Hawkeye and Black Widow something of interest but its the funny moments between Stark and co. that gives the film its spark. Samuel. L. Jackson's brings his usual 'don't mess with me' cool factor and his larger role also benefits the movie. Being critical, I'm not sure the plot gave enough explanation as to why Banner returned to fight alongside the others after showing nothing but resistance to let 'the other guy' appear, or how he was able to control Hulk more effectively in contrast with the film's earlier events.

The so called Battle of New York finale is a really exciting well-directed battle, especially when you consider it's similarities to the frantic city battles Michael Bay treated us to in his Transformer films.

2013-01-06,This movie was just bad. I love Joss Whedon but he needs a guy sitting over him while he is writing to tell him his jokes aren't funny. They chose the storyline that doesn't connect with the others on the least likeable character. All the other avengers are really good at something or science gave them powers but Thor is just a heavy handed dueche that has powers because of the cop out that he is a god.

2013-01-05,Got to be the best movie i saw in 2012. Great cast a very simplistic but decent story and some good dialogue. One of the things i like about this film and it gets so right is a GREAT final battle in the last 45 minutes which just looks amazing. alot of theese comic book movie films have theese crap 1-2 minute ones that are just so lame and anticlimactic that it almost makes the movie feel like a waste. The one problem is though you have a great team of super heroes fighting one guy names loki and his army of Alien things. would have been so much cooler if it was a team of villians. Oh well for Avengers 2 then hopefully. Other then that don't waste your time seeing this in 3D . This was my first 3D movie i rented for my 3D TV and the 3D just felt tacked on outside of a few moments when it looked cool.

2012-12-14,"Well, it's The Avengers. I shouldn't have to say more. But I will.

I haven't seen the superhero movies leading up to this. I've only seen the Hulk sequel (the Edward Norton one), Iron Man, and Thor. While there were times when I was lost, I could follow this movie's plot. I need to seen Iron Man 2 since it has Nick Fury and Black Widow.

LOKI! I'm not one of those crazy obsessive Loki fangirls, but I loved Loki in this movie. That being said, I still found it hilarious when the Hulk picked him up and slammed him around. Funniest part of the movie.

What's good about this movie is that it strikes a good balance between comedy and drama. Joss Whedon knows the Avengers don't need the Dark Knight treatment and wisely did not go that route. But wasn't unbelievably cartoony and silly either. It knew when to be serious and when to make the audience laugh.

The characters were fun and each actor played the role well. Hawkeye didn't get much to do but it it got Jeremy Renner in a tight outfit. Good enough for me! The newest addition to the cast was Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk. He fit the role unbelievably well. Makes sense since Ruffalo has proven time and again that he's a fantastic actor.

2012-11-13,"There are a lot of people giving this movie a perfect ten out of ten. This is understandable, but only if you are going into it thinking its a family movie. The Avengers is relatively tame, contains cheap, slapstick humor (take the Captain America trading cards for example), and the plot is extremely simple and easy to follow. Though these detract from the movie in my personal opinion, there are some upsides if you are like me and prefer a more complex action movie. The special effects are amazing, the cast is, for the most part, star studded, and if you have invested time in the other movies leading up to The Avengers there are references that reward the viewer. That being said, if you are either going as a family, or a fan of the other movie, you will enjoy The Avengers.

2012-10-14,"Less than impressed with this film given its stellar reviews upon release. It is one of those not so rare cases of style over substance, the style being fight scenes and blowing stuff up before coming to an inevitable conclusion of saving the world together and going their separate ways. The attempts at comedy are laboured and obviously, like the film, directed at a popcorn chomping audience where films are to be enjoyed with minds switched off. The emotional climaxes in the film also seemed contrived and insincere, as is the case with many big budget films lacking in story and human connection. Firstly are we really meant to care about agent coulson dying merely because we are told 20 minutes before he died he ideolized captain america? And secondly what is the point in pretending to kill off iron man when all of the audience has seen that moment in the trailer a million times when the hulk catches iron man out of the sky and destroys a building in the process?

2012-10-08,"A perfectly average superhero movie...

I didn't see this for a while and some friends hyped it up as the best thing ever. I was pretty disappointed to begin with, because at the start there are some problems with the main characters. With having so many it was bound to happen... but still, it just doesn't feel right and I can't put my finger on it. Having said that, later on it gets better... much better. The characters find their niches and they come to life. I was just hoping they'd be a bit more interesting beforehand. They contrast nicely and work better than in their own films at times. There are some great action sequences and some memorable moments and it's all very fun. It's just not very complicated at all. I was expecting more a X-Men First Class or Watchmen vibe to it. (I know that was a silly idea now)

The problem is that you'd expect a film like this to blow you away and really immerse you, but honestly I turned it off halfway through and came back to it. Where as with First Class I watched it start to finish and then went back to some scenes again because it was soooo bad-ass. It takes a while to get going and then never really goes anywhere *that* interesting once it does. This is probably because the whole point of the film was to bring the avengers together and set them up for a sequel. If that's it then fair play, good film, point made. But First Class did that AND gave the guys something pretty interesting to do and also make some bold claims about sociology. ( I do love and highly recommend that film)

All in all it's alright. If you are going to see it, you've probably seen it by now. If not, catch it on Sky Movies in a few months or something when you're bored because it's not that special.

Though the plot was pretty simple and very straight forward (aliens comes in, humans kick their asses) but the thing that made it work is that the plot was very close to the comic books (which exactly what this movie achieved) and the fact that characters were polished and three dimensional.
The visuals and the art direction was very enjoyable and an amazing food for imagination. Action was breath taking and at parts very inventive. The antagonist of the film Loki was intimidating and interesting.

Extremely jerky plotline, at times it seems like I am watching a commercial for seven upcoming movies. In no way do any of the cast, save for Downey, represent what I would call acting. Johanssen is awkward to look at, seemingly too chubby to look viable as any sort of action actress, and again tends to float in and out of her lines. Hemsworth/Thor gives a good turn, yet he just isn't given much to work with. It is like watching a bad soap opera for teenage boys. Too silly and too cheesy to sit longer than a half hour through.

2012-08-28,"The Avengers: A messy film that does little to appeal to the non pre-existing comic fans. Struggles to fit a coherent narrative between the action scenes.

While action is pretty, The Avengers never seems to quite know what to do with so many main characters.  Making huge assumptions that the viewer already knows each character's arc, they bypass any arc entirely and just have them fighting a lot.

Even Transformers 3, a movie I found very messy and tough to watch, manages to have a pretty coherent and linear story, that just tries to do a few things too many.  But The Avengers seems to decide to leave behind linearity and a character arcs, and just let chaos happen.

The best Marvel film for me is still Iron Man, as it plays with strong character arcs, a progressive and interesting plot, with a sense of 'realistic' special effects and the 'super hero' notion is dialled down a bit.

2012-07-21,"Ok. Firstly, I've got to say that I had a good time watching The Avengers. There were some interesting moments and liners that even I still remember up to now. Robert Downey Jr. did well as Tony Stark/Ironman and I seriously can't imagine that character is played by another actor. Mark Ruffalo also stole the show. From the beginning until some moments before the ending you could witness how tense he was. He seemed to think that as if he was a nuke that could just blow out at anytime. In short, in term of the characters, I think that there was no flaws at all. The characters were delivered superbly.
However, just like most superhero movies, I found out that I actually don't care about the faith of each character. I had already known that every single main character would survive the day even before I started watching it. As a result, I felt no personal feelings toward the characters. I wasn't afraid that by the end of the movie Ironman would probably die nor I couldn't care less about Hawkeye and Black Widow's relationship. Apart from Bruce Banner character, I felt that I wasn't attached to the characters. They were all flat. And the way I see it, there is always a minus point in watching a movie that you know that the major characters will just survive: There is no tension. I ain't commenting on the story since this movie is not for the hardcore audience;this one is aimed into family teritory.

2012-07-04,"Probably one of THE best Marvel film out there. This film has everything a Marvel fan or any Action fan has and even more! The writing is superb and it doesn't make 1 superhero above everyone else, all of them are equal even the lesser ones like Hawkeye and Black Widow, heck even Nick Fury. Unfortunately this film is plagued with a fault every other Marvel film has; pacing. I feel that the middle-point of the film was very boring and it was just talkin and talkin also the attack on the flying ship was pretty lame too, there wasn't much spectacle except when Banner Hulks out. Which comes to my next point, holy sht the last fight is pretty intense and literally redeems all of the flaws I have with this film. So I'll give it a 9/10.

2012-06-26,"Perspective: A fan of Avengers comics and cartoons for decades. Loved almost every Marvel movie to date

Expectations: Been waiting on an Avengers movie since Iron Man, totally blown away by the trailers

Delivery: Speaking as a fan of the original source material, Avengers totally blew me away. The ultimate experience for fans of the comics AND movies. Seeing these all of these characters interact (and fight) with one another is rewarding on so many levels. I was a highly volatile mixture bubbling over with geeky excitement for the entire film. For those who don't read comics but enjoyed the Marvel films, Avengers takes all that you loved about those previous movies (action, humor, and a good story) combines them and sprinkles them generously throughout the entire experience. For the artsy types, this is an fx laden superhero action adventure movie, so don't go in expecting to see Shakespeare with laser beams, or Citizen Kane with a cape

All that aside, this is a great film that has plenty of action and humour.

2012-05-27,"I think this was my very first movie I watched in 2012 and I gotta say, I liked it. My initial concerns were about how the movie would live up to this enormous hype it had already built up and how Joss Whedon, a director I have never even heard of, would develop the personalities of multiple characters the movie has. Surprisingly enough, he exceeded my expectations in a good way. The story and dialogue was created with full blown Hollywood style treatment, but it was witty, enjoyable, and had a solid point. The character development was also strong, something that most directors cannot handle due to the fact that making 7 superheroes individually stand out is pretty difficult. But hey, Joss Whedon did it, so I give huge credit and respect for it. Anyways, long words short, in my opinion this was a good summer blockbuster, keeping constant of it's premise and living up to the hype.

2012-05-27,"The build up and hype for this movie was definitely worth it. It's one of those movies you'll be replaying over and over in your head, reciting some familiar lines with friends, and be dying to see again after you leave the theater.  I enjoyed the build up a lot actually and the not-so-action-packed scenes, as they allowed you to get reacquainted with each character, their story, and their personality. Seeing the collection of actors interact with one another also provides some really cool moments as well, and they all meshed together quite nicely. Every hero in this movie gets multiple moments to shine, which I absolutely loved, and there's some brilliant comedic moments mixed in with the action to keep you thoroughly entertained. I thought Samuel Jackson's lines could have been better written at times, as well as Chris Evan's and Cobie Smulders', but for the most part, I came away saying that it was definitely worth seeing in theaters.  The Hulk and Iron Man especially steal the show in this one... and not to give too much away here, but fans of the show ""How I Met Your Mother"" may also really like this film too, as a couple references (not sure if they were intentional or not, but then again, Cobie Smulders is in this) to the show are made.",10,2012-05,Sunday,"absolutely:0.08, action:0.07, actors:0.07, actually:0.07, after:0.07, again:0.14, all:0.04, also:0.11, and:0.21, another:0.07, are:0.04, as:0.20, at:0.05, away:0.17, be:0.08, been:0.06, better:0.06, brilliant:0.08, build:0.17, but:0.10, came:0.08, character:0.05, chris:0.08, cool:0.08, could:0.06, couple:0.08, definitely:0.13, each:0.06, enjoyed:0.08, especially:0.07, every:0.06, fans:0.07, film:0.04, for:0.07, get:0.06, gets:0.07, give:0.07, have:0.04, here:0.07, hero:0.06, how:0.06, hulk:0.05, hype:0.08, if:0.05, in:0.18, iron:0.05, is:0.03, it:0.08, jackson:0.08, keep:0.09, like:0.04, lines:0.17, ll:0.07, lot:0.06, loved:0.07, made:0.06, man:0.05, may:0.08, moments:0.20, most:0.06, movie:0.05, movies:0.04, much:0.05, multiple:0.08, not:0.15, of:0.07, one:0.11, or:0.05, over:0.13, packed:0.07, part:0.07, quite:0.07, really:0.10, samuel:0.08, scenes:0.06, see:0.05, seeing:0.13, show:0.21, so:0.04, some:0.15, story:0.05, sure:0.07, that:0.03, the:0.22, theater:0.08, their:0.11, then:0.06, there:0.05, they:0.14, this:0.13, those:0.07, thought:0.07, times:0.07, to:0.15, together:0.05, too:0.12, up:0.10, was:0.07, well:0.10, were:0.05, which:0.06, with:0.14, worth:0.14, written:0.08, you:0.16, your:0.13"
2012-05-26,"All the pieces of the Marvel film puzzle have finally been assembled, and the outcome was... fairly satisfying. It has all the thrills and flares needed for the first blockbuster of the summer and its packed with a lot of humor and cynicism that keeps things light. The visuals and sound designs were dynamic; and action sequences bombastic, but the icing on the cake were the characters that were brought to life (once again) for the big screen; Captain America, Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and the Agents. They were unique, dynamic, and director Joss Whedon did a good job at offering them equitable screen presence. None of them got lost in the mix. But the standout was surely Mark Ruffalo's take on Hulk, which exceeds the 2 previous versions by a land slide. Despite all the fun action and smart humor, the film was fairly empty. Our heroes weren't faced with any serious struggles or personal demons, they only had to kick the butts of those who wish to 'Take over the World'! And that wasn't a hard task for them. All that I saw in this movie was the same formula, redone in a (slightly) more charismatic way.

Yes its super cool with a team of superheroes saving the earth but thats pretty much it. the dialogue and script of the movie is so bad. seriously. at times while watching the movie i laughed so hard at the script not becos its hillarious its because of the poor script. very cliche and predictable storyline. The action was not bad. and there are too many plotholes. when we watch a superhero movie we have to defy logic and just enjoy the 2 hours ride but i just cant for this movie. there are so many illogical and unwarranted events. The best marvel film so far is probly iron man without a doubt and maybe the incredible hulk. rober downey jr was at his brilliant best. mark ruffalo does a not bad impersonation of the hulk. the rest are very mediocre. honestly i didnt expect much from this movie. cos u cant expect a top class movie with multiple superheros. but i was quite excited to watch it like i said  a team of superheroes. who wouldnt? but i guess blockbuster movies are like that. just hoping the dark knight rises and the amazing spiderman would be epic!,5,2012-05,Thursday,"action:0.03, amazing:0.05, and:0.17, are:0.17, as:0.08, at:0.14, bad:0.27, be:0.04, because:0.06, best:0.08, blockbuster:0.07, brilliant:0.08, but:0.17, by:0.05, cool:0.08, dark:0.07, dialogue:0.06, does:0.06, downey:0.07, earth:0.08, enjoy:0.07, epic:0.07, everyone:0.07, expect:0.16, fact:0.08, far:0.06, film:0.04, for:0.03, from:0.05, get:0.06, good:0.08, hard:0.08, has:0.05, have:0.04, his:0.06, hours:0.08, hulk:0.09, incredible:0.07, iron:0.05, is:0.10, it:0.10, its:0.22, jr:0.07, just:0.13, knight:0.07, like:0.08, man:0.05, many:0.12, mark:0.06, marvel:0.04, maybe:0.08, me:0.05, movie:0.22, movies:0.04, much:0.10, multiple:0.08, not:0.18, of:0.12, overrated:0.08, pretty:0.06, quite:0.07, rest:0.09, ruffalo:0.06, said:0.08, script:0.23, seriously:0.08, so:0.22, spiderman:0.09, still:0.06, storyline:0.08, super:0.06, superhero:0.04, superheroes:0.12, team:0.12, that:0.03, the:0.30, there:0.09, think:0.06, this:0.11, times:0.07, to:0.05, too:0.06, top:0.07, very:0.10, was:0.10, watch:0.11, watching:0.07, we:0.13, when:0.05, while:0.06, who:0.06, with:0.07, without:0.08, would:0.05, wrong:0.08"

But, I think it's been slightly overrated by a large chunk of people calling it the best superhero movie ever, when I think The Dark Knight still holds that title.  There are just a few moments were it seemed the plot was kinda stretched to the limits, like when Tony Stark figures out that Loki is at the top of Stark Tower based on absolutely nothing.  Then there are the several awkward dialogue moments like when Cap. America says, ""The last time I was in Germany and I saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing.""

Las actuaciones son lo mas destacable, Mark Ruffalo hizo un gran trabajo interpretando a Bruce Banner, siempre dando una sensacion de humildad por parte de este personaje, eso hasta que se tranforma en Hulk. Thor, interpretado por Chris Hemsworth, finalmente le dio un toque mas maduro al personaje, justo como en los comics. Chris Evans nunca de los nunca me termino de convencer como el Capitan America, es un personaje que le queda GIGANTESCO, pero observe una mejora a comparacion de la pelÃcula del personaje. Y creo que no hace falta decirlo, Robert Downey Jr. es brillante como Tony Stark. Yo les pongo un 8, esta puede ser la mejor pelÃcula de Super heroes por el momento, hicieron un buen trabajo en el especto de las actuaciones, le toco a cada uno su pedacito de pan, osea, su momento de robar camara.

Action was superb especially toward the major final showdown. Acting is fantastic(Mark Ruffalo and the Hulk are quite loveable and you wont miss Ed Norton TOO much.)

Though the threat isn't incredibly frightening it provides just enough danger for the plot to seem real and significant enough to justify this great meeting of heroes...

Jackson both manage to pull focus and remind you you're watching a bad movie more than they usually do,  which is saying something; and the cast is generally much too aware they are in a movie for it to work.

Once you've seen the action, you've seen all there is to see, and there is no point whatsoever to come back again to it.

I just hope this doesn't downgrade the single hero movies coming out like the next iron man or captain America. Lots of people talk about how grate Hulk was in the movie and now that i finally seen the movie i know what they're talking about , he was amazing. Thanks to the ""GODS"" characters in the movie Hulk didn't have to hold back like in the other Hulk movies but , I have to say my favorite with out a doubt was Thor !!!!  Just like Hulk Thor wasn't pulling punches. He went full god mode in this movie. **** epic !!!  OK so if their is one thing i didn't like was how Black widow was doing more then Captain America. I think she kicked more ass and had more camera time then they Captain America. I also liked the captain America suit he had in his own movie. The suit with the brown boots.

2012-05-16,"I don't get all the hoopla over this film.  In the end, it was yet another superhero movie with the same predictable storyline.  It does have great special effects, good action (although a very shaky camera during the action sequences), and good 3D.  They were smart to feature Iron Man more than the others as he is by far the most interesting of the Super Heroes.  I have to say though, that it gets old that these heroes keep getting beaten to a pulp, then they get up without a scratch on them like a cartoon character.  Ridiculous.  I also thought that the Hulk was not supposed to be lucid when he was in his hulk state, yet at the end of the film he is calm and even says a few words while being a Hulk.

I came into the movie with good to great expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Its over 2 hours long and the beginning does lag a bit but the payoff is worth it. This is the pinnacle of what a popcorn movie should be. There's a decent story, good character building, excellent choreography and effects, and just the right amount of attitude and humor. I saw this with a five year old and he loved it. A note of caution concerning younger viewers, there is some blood and the ""bad guys"" can be scary.

2012-05-16,"If you didn't see the other 5 movies, go watch them first (even Hulk).  The movie will taunt you with flashbacks to the old movies and you won't get to see the full character development.  Having only been armed with the Iron Man movies, understanding of Norse Mythology, and basic background on the other heroes, I still got  a good understanding of what was going on.  However, the movie had a lot of elements from the other movies, specifically Thor.  The movie's beginning is S.L.O.W, almost as slow as the first Willy Wonka.  I'm not going to spoil the story, but don't worry, you'll forget about it.  It's basically the Marvel formula: Bad thing happens, find hero(es), train, find bad guy, some one dies, attack on New York, save the day, New Yorkers go yay.  As for the characters, it's hit and miss.  Tony Stark and Loki are very enjoyable and witty, Captain America and Bruce Banner are alright, and everyone else is paper thin.  Very little character development happens and by the end, the characters are still the same people.  The final fight scene was as you think it would be.  The effects are well done and the Hulk provides comic relief.  My favorite scene by far was when Hulk was chasing Black Widow, though.  Don't worry about the music, because you won't notice it.  It's drowned out the the amazing amount of dialogue in this movie.  Even in the fight scenes they can't shut up.  There's no suspense whatsoever.  Overall, I was very disappointed, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a good movie.

2012-05-16,"This film was probably one of the most funny movies I have seen this year. Also, it was one of the most badass. I say that lightly, but give it the aformentioned status because Joss Whedon was at the helm for this one. Now a word of warning: the film will be confusing to you at first if you have not seen the movies that came before it. Those films set a general framework, so Whedon assumes you know what is going on. This is not a setback, because it saves time having to explain everything. I went to see this film for the Hulk, and I was not disappointed. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man was like revisiting an old friend, as he makes the film less serious which is good. The comedic moments catch you off guard, and help to add to the charm the film has. I was pissed because I had to watch the film in 3D, but the 3D was not horrible. It was adapted at a tolerable framerate that did not give me headaches. If you must watch it in 3D, do not fret.

Now for a solid week, fake life-style comic nerds have been building this thing up to me like it was the second coming of Christ. It isn't. Think of it like this. 'Love In The Time Of Cholera' is a far better literary work than a 'Wolverine' comic. They are truly different animals. Using this example, ""Scarface"" is a far better film than ""The Avengers"". I didn't get the impression Joss Whedon was trying to make high cinematic art here, which is fine, if you take it at that level. It's fun.

2012-05-15,"Digital Money Maker

This is the crash! Bang! Wallop! movie of the year. It's digital, it's funny, it's stupid and it's in 3D -the first must see, post Avatar. Only if you don't know who each character is, or haven't seen their movies, you may be at a loss to follow (as if that matters).

Loki (see Thor) has made a deal to get revenge on Thor and the Earth (of course) by getting some ridiculous source of power to some very bad aliens. All of the Marvel heroes - flawed heroes all - have to first unite, then trounce the invaders. And they do and you know they will.

The script is way above average for this kind of film - think Iron Man witty. The cast is top notch - especially Mark Ruffolo (Hulk), Downey (Iron Man) and the redoubtable Samuel L. Jackson as the team leader (Fury). No doubt, Jackson has replaced Morgan Freeman as the black American god who can do no wrong. The effects are as good as they get, as long as you can focus your eyes. It is often like putting your head in a washing machine with 3D glasses on.

Joss Whedon wrote, directed and probably gave birth to this film all on his own, and he makes a good fist of it. Despite it's enormous length - 147 minutes of popcorn chomping, it keeps your attention and never takes itself too seriously. I only wish that poor Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) will take a serious part next - you know, like in Hurt Locker and the Town - to balance his all action man roles.

It was very thrilling and the action scenes were incredible  and its had some really funny moment too which tells that the movie is not boring at all. Robart , Tom was the best as they were before. Hamsworth was good but not better then he was on Thor . Evans on the other seemed kinda different . seems like he was too angry about everything . Scarlet was super and her action scenes were perfect but hated her hair style. S.l.Jackson and Jeremy was super too . And last Cobie was the surprise of the film . I saw her every week on HIMYM but here seeing her beauty just made my day ! plus her custom was WahaaoooO !!!
Effect was good as well as al the other work . But I didnt like the theme song that much . It wasnt bad but its not catchy like other superhero films.Overall The Avengers is a total perfect Entertainment !

It really shows how knowledgeable you are Mr Otter  hence your spelling too needs improving. I do not know what you look for in rating a nice movie.

Ben_Otter,  I would avoid making comments until you do a little research about  any movie you watch and review.

2012-05-11,"Superhero movies need two things - a decent baddie (not too camp, not too psychotic) and the film must still be watchable when the heroes are in civilian mode. Does The Avengers have both of these? Just about. The baddie, Loki from the first Thor movie, has the (Hollywood) required British accent that all baddies must have these days, and weaves carefully between camp and stabby-nasty, without straying too far into either territory, though the horned helmet was surely daft.

When the heroes aren't on screen, the movie's carried by Samuel L Jackson, Robert Downy Jr, and Chris Evans, who together manage to neutralize Scarlett Johansson's usual monotone, single expression, cardboard cut out performance. New Hulk on the block Mark Ruffalo, is probably the best Bruce Banner to date. Thor and Hawkeye make up the numbers, and though I loved the Thor/Hulk punch-up scene (comic fan boy wet dream), thought the film would haven't lacked if either Norse god or arrow slinging assassin had stayed at home. Script-wise, there were some nice touches, with Samuel L Jackson's Rick Savage (silly name) leaving one classic sentence unfinished and therefore adding to the kudos factor ten fold (you should spot it if you're paying attention). Luckily there wasn't too much of the irritating Tony Stark/Pepper Potts sniping that made Iron Man 2 so hard to bear. Chris Evans' Capt America was the biggest surprise for me. I thought in a lot of ways he was the clue that held the thing together - neither too gung-ho, too whiny and too daft, three traits that curse a lot of on screen superheroes.

The action sequences were ok, but the one at Shield headquarters felt a little contrived. The pacing also abruptly shifted down a gear about half an hour into the film, and stayed there for what felt like too long, with all the talkie bits stitched together in one long sequence.

2012-05-11,"After setting it up with multiple films about how the individual characters gained their super powers, The Avengers finally brings together all of the heroes in one story to either work together as team to defend Earth or fight amongst each other aided by their massive egos and verbal bravado.  Perhaps never before in cinema history have there been so many movies released as prequels to set up the eventual crown jewel.  Batman and Superman only met in the comics, not on the big screen.  The Avengers appears to be sort of a test case to see if so many leading superheroes can all share the same screen.

While all six characters each receive a certain amount of on screen time and side story, some are pushed more into the foreground than others.  As Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is a fan favorite and is always handy with a funny quip, he is front and center along with Captain America (Chris Evans) who even though does not have much of a super power, places himself in a sort of leadership role within the group.  Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and the two characters that did not get their own films, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) all fight for the leftover screen time in the background.

2012-05-09,"How many comic book based movies get it right? Not many.  However, this one does and does it really damn well.  When I went to see this, I half expected the movie to spend an hour getting everyone together for a the big finally which would last maybe 15 minutes.  Thus, my expectations were low. Real low.

But, much to my surprise, they made that quick and easy. Most of the movie is action based. Even better, they still add a lot of plot to the movie as to not be on a one way track.

Joss Whedon put together a pretty difficult idea that was born with the first Iron Man. Something incredibly hard to pull off and some say too bloody expensive to make.

I think Tom Hiddleston and Mark Ruffalo stole the show and I can't wait to see Mr. Ruffalo in the next Hulk movie. Suffice to say, go watch The Avengers, it's the best Summer Block buster ride till Mr. Brooding Knight Rises.

However critically speaking there is not much more to offer and the film doesn't provide any great depth for those who don't appreciate big action movies. The humorous banter between the cast of disparate characters trying to come together is clearly a strong point. The lack of development on a couple of key players detracts from an otherwise rather wonderful character-driven experience. The plot is largely derivative and predictable but as the focus is on characters it remains true to the spirit of the comic source material. The exaggerated violence while amazing and funny is, when you consider the flip-side, implausible and cartoon-like at points.

The basic premise is very difficult to portray in a movie: how could you manage to give each character a decent amount of developement?  Actors: how could you make this people interact with each other without prima donna dilemmas? Well I was surprisingly pleased to see this movie. You have to suspend your disbelief in order to enjoy it, we're talking about attractive people with ridicolous costumes with superpowers. Fortunately the dialogue is funny and interesting enough to give this characters a minimal amount of depth. Iron man is the star of the show, he could be charming even if he was shown buying toilet paper. I never heard of the Black widow before but she is a serious contender for spotlight - stealing. The others characters are okay, for me Thor was the least interesting character. The villain on the other hand, seemed interesting, I think a lot of his scenes were cut that would further analyzes his motives or his ideals. He is not the classical:""I am EVIL, I want to rule the world with my EVILNESS!"", he has reasons. Action scenes were superb, very entertaining and fast paced.

2012-05-07,"Best Marvel film yet? Maybe not. Best Joss Whedon film? Nope, Serenity's smarter and darker, and the Whedon co-written The Cabin In The Woods is more ambitious. But what makes The Avengers so impressive is how it manages to stick to a classic comicbook/action formula, yet somehow feel utterly fresh and distinct. Be it the script, the settings, or the combination of so many superheroes sharing screen space - all freed from an origins story arc or sequel expectations - it just feels--- new, and gleefully satisfying. The characters are bold, yet feel human. And the action is spectacular but never dehumanising (we don't *need* to see civilians being killed during the major set-pieces).

So I saw it in 3D two days later, and thought it was fantastic.  I would actually consider seeing it in 3D again. It is one of the best post-production 3D conversions I've ever seen.  But even when not focusing on the 3D, this film has great replay value.  The film itself was just as good, and possibly better, the second time around.  The storyline may be a bit simplistic, and it may be a bit overlong for some, but these are only a small quarrels.  The action is absolutely incredible, the acting is very good across the board, and the humor is actually funny.  For all of you Transformers fans out there, go see this movie, and see if you'll want to watch another Transformers movie again.  In comparison to those films, the Avengers does everything better.

Well, it exceeded my expectations, because it was flat out AMAZING! I especially enjoyed Mark Ruffalo, who I never thought was all that great of an actor, as the Incredible Hulk. Plus, the special effects and action sequences were top-notch. What I really loved was the fact that they allowed the characters to be more than just your standard superheroes. Normally, I confess, when I see a fight in one of these movies, I just casually think ""****'s gonna win this one.""

There is some pretty funny dialogue between the main cast, and the effects were great. Despite the final twenty minute non-stop action sequence, it started to feel boring near the end. I heard such great reviews earlier, and through the whole film I was waiting for it to really take off and amaze me, which unfortunately it didn't.

2012-05-06,"One of the few movies that lives up to the hype and actually manages to exceed it in almost every way. All the actors deserve major props. RDJ continues to make tony stark a compelling character. Cap and Thor both do great with their roles. Scarlett Johansson has never impressed me with her acting chops (she has in other ways though), but she does a great job with the character she is given. Jeremy Renner is unsurprisingly badass as Hawkeye as well. Tom Hiddleston plays the slimy bastard that is Loki so well that it makes sense a team of heroes would be necessary. The scene stealer is the Hulk, whether he is ""the other guy"" or not. Awesome job by Mark Ruffalo and unexpected by me and many others for sure. However, the biggest reason the movie works is because of Joss Whedon. Never seen much of his work but he really shows his skill with dialogue, jokes, character arcs, and especially female characters. The action was the best I have ever seen. Imagine Transformers if it had characters you care about and a story that made sense.  The acting and action were probably expected by all of us, but my worries were with the pacing and how all of the characters would get their due.  The pacing was perfect and I wouldnt have complained if the movie was 3 hours long.  Whedon confirmed there are 30 minutes of deleted scenes, I hope he changes his mind and one day releases the 3 hour film.  As for the characters, they physically fight only within the confines of the story. I was nervous their interactions would be forced, but Whedon does a great job of keeping them related to the story. The comedy in Iron Man 2 really threw off the serious aspects of the story, but somehow the comedy flows within the story so that when the story is serious, you feel that as well.  Not an easy achievement by any means.  While TDKR will certainly be the better overall film (at least it looks that way), The Avengers is the more fun film and a film that you will never get sick of. What a great summer for comic book fans, and movie fans in general. Chances are you have seen The Avengers (just broke all time domestic record), so nothing i say will matter anyway.

2012-05-06,"Ultimately, The Avengers is a Joss Whedon movie.  For those familiar with Joss Whedon's works, you have a formulaic approach to group dynamics.  There's the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Girl of the group, who is unfazed and stoic to all of the happenings around her and utilizes her femininity to trick the men around her while she lays the smack down.  You have the Goofy Guy who makes light of everything and is terribly superficial.  The No-Nonsense, Misplaced Guy who typically acts like he carries a heavy burden around with him in a world he doesn't fit in with anymore.  And so and so forth.  Essentially, if you've watched Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Serenity, or even read Whedon's run on Uncanny X-Men, you have the jist of his workings, a method he uses over and over again.  If you're a fan, you'll love The Avengers.  If you're not, well, Robert Downey, Jr keeps it entertaining (because this is his third outing in role he's grown into, unlike the rest of the cast).

2012-05-06,"Joss Whedon's action packed Marvel adventure The Avengers is a success in almost every way possible. With such a big cast and many important characters, juggling them all would be something hard to accomplish, making sure they all get their screen time and we get to see their point of view, but for Joss, making such movies to their fullest potential seems to be in his nature.




The best part about The Avengers is that Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) are all apart of this one (very best) Marvel blockbuster. Each with their own unique introduction (and all giving exceptional performances), you get the chills every time one is introduced and they continue throughout the movie. The Avengers initiative was something introduced to us in Iron Man 2 with our first look at Black Widow and Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., but it wasn't something ever forced until needed. Now that Loki, the god of mischief (brother of Thor, god of thunder) made Nick Fury very desperate, he has no choice to to initiate The Avengers. What brings Loki back? He still doesn't sit well with his adoptive bother having all of his glory with being king of Asgard and plans to destroy the world by stealing the Tesseract (a cosmic cube that can open to portal from planet to planet) and  with his army of aliens.




The Avengers is taken at a steady pace, focusing on the heroes themselves and their relationships with each other developing (they don't like one another at first). While this goes on with the most necessary humor (I'm not being sarcastic) and some action between them we learn more about how Loki's plan is working with getting captured and unleashing his army and how The Avengers work together.




From beginning to end The Avengers is one of the most successful action packed comic book adaptations ever. You couldn't ask for more with everything it serves to fans of all ages.

2012-05-05,"To say that Marvel's, The Avengers is a poorly made film tells me that you have no idea of what a good film could ever possibly be. What makes Joss Whedon's film succeeds as a great comic-book movie, no, as a good action film, is in its ability to be clear, concise, tight and conscious piece of cinema. With such an ambitious goal of bringing so many Marvel properties under one roof, the film has to be clear, concise and tight. It has to get to the point, it has to go from point A to point B without any narrative gap, and it has to have a strong film logic. The minute we get confused at ""why is this there"" or ""why did they do that"" is where we as an audience lose interest. The film was tightly packed, but not stiff. The sequences on the helicarrier, where we find that our characters are somehow intertwined, these scenes represent the tightness. Robert and Banner in their interactions shine gloriously, as they convincingly offer an idea that these two could indeed be good friends. It was a nice moment that gave us some readied clarity on the realness of these properties. The action in the climax of the film really showcases the tightness as well. We know who is who, why they move the way they do, and where they are going. We root for the heroes, we want the villains to lose. But we get some great moments that really shine.

2012-05-05,"Please don't listen to the snobby anti-genre movie reviews. As a guy who enjoys a good introspective, quiet indie full of symbolism and heavy thought... this was a GOOD movie. No, a GREAT movie. I laughed, I clapped, I felt for the characters on screen. Joss Whedon remains a figure of cult hysteria because his scripts tap into the minds ****, and rightly so. He does nothing less in this film, and every single actor is up to the challenge. Of particular note here are Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk - and the best version so far. It's hard to tell how much of this is creditable to Ruffalo's display as Banner and how much credit goes to the writing and CG wizards behind this version of the not-so-jolly green giant. But I will say that this movie finally shed the idea that a proper exploration of the Hulk has to be cerebral, introspective, and outright depressing. This Hulk manages to be both affecting AND fun, and Ruffalo's Banner is just as interesting as the ""other guy.""

RDJ as Tony Stark continues to impress. Honestly, there's no real weak link in the cast. I was a little worried about Sam Jackson's ability to wrap his mouth around Whedon's poppy dialogue, but his Nick Fury carried a fantastic amount of gravitas and screen presence, and really added dramatic weight I was surprised to see from an actor who has become (sadly) better known for his culty larger-than-life persona than his acting.

All in all, this is just a fantastic film, and one I plan to see in the theater again before it leaves - an activity I rarely do in the time of high-priced entertainment. Kudos Whedon, kudos Marvel.

2012-05-05,"An example of how you do a big budget, blockbuster film in the best possible way. From start to finish, The Avengers is entertainment perfection and the best film Marvel has ever put out yet. Director and writer Joss Whedon implements his trademark humour and cinematography to make the film not just funny, but also tightly paced and action packed. I'm impressed that Whedon could handle this many characters at once, especially heroes but it isn't surprising because he's done it before. While Tony Stark/Iron Man have slightly more screen time and has the most jokes and one liners, not one character is wasted or slandered and the main ensemble cast play each other extremely well and every single one of them gets a shining moment thanks to a very well written script and steady pacing. Mark Ruffalo is the best Hulk ever and I'm surprised that they didn't over sexualised Black Widow in contrast to what the trailers show but now that I think about it, it's Joss Whedon, whom you should know created Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I cannot rave this film enough and I've already seen it twice in the cinema. It is the blockbuster film of the year. It is so entertaining and so much fun to watch and it is a shining example of how a big budget blockbuster film should entertain a general audience.

The Hulk's line is wonderful, but poorly delivered and 2 of the people who saw the film with me did not even catch it as a result.

There's also a lot of exposition completely missing: why was the Hulk a self-confessed untamed monster who actually tries to kill Black Widow but the NEXT time he ""comes out"" he's transformed into an entirely willing ally?

From his experience with Buffy to Firefly and Dollhouse, he has learned how to develop an ensemble cast and provide each character with enough screen time to not just have time to develop their character, but to have a sense of balance as a whole.   Each character proves to be an essential part of the greater whole. And that is where this movie shines.  No one is left out and everyone is used in a manner that pushes the story and development forward with no real lag in the narrative.

2012-05-05,"In the context of the debate over the A.O. Scott review of this film, clearly comic book movies can be done extremely well and are worth of the highest praise. The best in the genre include Batman Begins, Dark Knight, and the original Iron Man. All are highly entertaining and evocative films. What strikes me about The Avengers, now a couple of hours after seeing it, is that the personalities of each of the superheroes truly come out over the course of the film, which is essential in elevating them above plastic or wooden action figures, and I didn't think it would be possible, despite Whedon's involvement. Even Scarlett J's Black Widow is terrific - and I'm very much not a fan of her other work. Beyond the strong personalities, there are actually some truly funny laugh lines in the movie, which isn't always the case in this genre. The ""big"" action sequences toward the end of the film are better than your average comic book movie money scenes - and they're certain better than anything in the Transformers films - but I still found myself getting a little bored amidst the mayhem.

A bunch of superheros teaming up like this has never really been done before so this is definitely a very special film and after 4 years build up for marvel fans since the first Iron Man, it has managed to live up to its incredibly high hype. Joss Whedon has done what he does best and has made a bunch of different characters all have multiple and equal times in the spot light without one hogging all of the attention, the balance between these characters is great and it makes it hard to pick your favourite superhero and they all have so many awesome moments. The writing is strong and surprisingly really funny at points and the humour never feels forced and the all of the actors deliver with great performances all around. While the soundtrack is nothing special it still fits in to film well.

2012-05-04,"""The Avengers"" is thoughtful, funny, charming, consistent, and balances quiet moments with extremely clear and well executed action scenes. Some critics have talked about Samuel L. Jackson's glue for the superhero team, but Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson is the true glue, the one character that brings heart to the parade.

All of the characters are a marvel to watch, they each continue their story arcs as introduced in previous films, no time is wasted on exposition, and The Hulk finally gets to shine in a brilliant performance by Mark Ruffalo. Robert Downey Jr. is hilarious as always, and matching his timing and talents with the words of Josh Whedon is like marriage made in a heavenly hell. Nice stuff!

They did a great job of giving everyone a proper place in the movie without giving everyone powers to match one another necessarily.  Also compared to other Marvel movies in the past, like X-Men where they decided Wolverine needed act as leader all the time, it was nice to see that they used characters like Captain America to give orders and stay level headed while Iron Man was able to go off crazy and do his thing.  The jokes hit perfect, the timing and action was spot-on.

2012-05-04,"The film worked best when the Avengers played off each other and in the strength of the majority of dialogue. Loki has gravitas as a villain, Iron man is witty and Hulk is treated with restraint by the film-makers, but steals the show.
It does however have flaws; the extended actions scenes aren't all the memorable and are exhausting (especially in 3D). The opening will make you feel like you missed a film and played too seriously for how silly it is. Loki's army is under-developed, borrow an unrelated (and stupid sounding) name from the comics and are dealt with via a plot-contrivance, followed by a convenient killswitch. A lot of assumed knowledge is required to get for example, Maria Hill's inclusion or the foreshadowing of the final shot of Stark tower. Odd things like not calling Hawkeye, 'Hawkeye' seem like easily fixable glitches that get over-looked.

While the story was simplistic, I think that was a good thing because of the sheer number of things going on all at once. If you had a story with anymore to it, then this movie would have been really bogged down with just too much stuff. The over abundance of stuff in the movie doesn't let the heroes in this movie truly shine till the very end.

The final action sequence at the end doesn't disappoint though and it's worth going to see the movie just for that.

2012-05-04,"The Avengers is not as good as The Dark Knight, I'm just going to say that from the off, the storyline is escapism and it has some genuinely funny moments in it, but it doesn't have the deep characters or visual spectacle. Joss Whedon's script keeps the film going, and lets be honest, this film could have been a train wreck. What makes The Avengers tick is the relationships that each of the characters have with one another. This is where the film really takes flight, when all the characters are in a pressure cooker together, it gives the film weight and suspense especially with Mark Ruffalo's Hulk. Joss Whedon should be given a lot of credit for crafting such a cohesive and well thought out script.

The film script is what keeps it above board, visuals have never been Joss Whedon's strong suit, but I did notice a wink to his first feature film Serenity in a zoom shot near the finale. The film doesn't look bad by any means it just has the same sheen that the other Marvel films seem to sport, but it had to be this way to fit all the heroes together. But lack of visual flair is sometimes what makes me dislike these movies, they look too clean and have a sheen that makes it look too cartoony for my personal taste. The Xmen films and Burton and Nolan's Batman films seem to not have these ""sheens"" to them, which make them visually more appealing to me.

I've also never been a fan of 3D even when it works superbly like in Avatar, its just a gimmick to make more money most of the time. So I'd recommend watching Avengers in 2D, as it doesn't add anything to the film being in that third dimension.

Its very difficult to score this film as it is by and large a fantastic superhero film, thats enjoyable from beginning to end. Is it as all engrossing and goose-bump inducing as The Dark Knight, well no. Is it better than Spiderman, well yes, but I was never a fan of Sam Raimi's Spiderman anyway. Is it better than Thor, enjoyment wise its about the same. With no back stories to get through in The Avengers the time certainly flies by, it is great summer film.

2012-05-04,"I give this film 9/10. I'm dropping 1 point because they didn't exactly follow the original ""The Ulitmates"" story line, but came pretty damned close.

The film reflects Joss Whedons Humour with lots of nice humorous, but not out of place , quirky little moments. His wit is still very apparent from his Buffy/Angel/Firefly days. If it wasn't him who wrote the relevant scenes, it's someone trying to be like him !

The script and banter between everyone is snappy and everyone is already familiar with their roles so it's straight into the action. Everyone acted well and everyone took it seriously, but not TOO seriously.

I'm not giving away anymore plot than I already have in my opening statement, if you're familiar with the first 13 issue run of "" The Ultimates"" then you know roughly what's going on in the film. I should add here that you really end up hating Loki, again, what a great actor.

The films sounds amazing and looks even better, there is not a dull moment and I was thoroughly absorbed throughout. Lets have another one soon please.

And how about a Black Widow/Hawkeye spy/assassin flick in the mean time, they were both great characters incredibly well played by their respective actors.

Everyone already knows how good the actors that play Cap. America, Iron Man and Thor are, but those two mentioned above, and the chap that played the Hulk were also wonderful. As were the rest of the cast.

In order here's what I'd like to see next in the movies:-

New Iron Man, then a new Hulk, New Thor, New Cap. America, A Black Widow & Hawkeye spy story, with lots of Nick Fury in this one, THEN the second Avengers film. Then start the cycle again adding in a few other Avengers as time goes on. With the list above, and a film a year, that's a five year movie arc before it all starts again.

Now go and do it please people.
