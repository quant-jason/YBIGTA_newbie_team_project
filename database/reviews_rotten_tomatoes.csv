"Jan 16, 2025","Given the colossal task of pulling all of these films and characters together for the first time, this seemed doomed to fail, but it was great and flowed together seamlessly. Most characters grow in their arcs together and are able to play off of each other well. It’s aged a little bit, and some characters aren’t given much to do, but still a worthwhile movie.",4
"Jan 12, 2025","Maravilhoso, está no topo das adaptações de heróis.",5
"Jan 10, 2025","The Avengers is the most enjoyable time I've spent with the MCU so far.

It operates with established characters, but they still have character arcs and those are surprisingly very satisfying. Obviously I kind of knew what's going to happen, but that didn't take away a bit from the enjoyment. There were a few moments where I was shocked or didn't know how the story would move forward. The dialogues sometimes feel a little out of place, but are mostly good.

The visual effects have never been this good in the MCU so far, I loved that. I also love the huge cast, although I was sad to see one of my favourite actors, Stellan Skarsgård turned into a villain, alongside Jeremy Renner. The cinematography is great, but the movie is a little too long, so I'm not the biggest fan of the editing. The acting performances are good for a superhero movie.

The Avengers is an amazing culmination to the first phase of the MCU.",4.5
"Jan 7, 2025","Overall,  the film was epic. However, I did feel that some parts were slow just because there was a lot of unnecessary dialogue.",3
"Jan 1, 2025","The original MCU Avengers movie is everything an Avengers movie should have been. The ultimate crossover having all the main characters from the previous installments join together to face Loki of Asgard together in a survival of the fittest war. With all hell breaking loose, and a chaos that is only just begun, the Avengers face their destiny and embark on the future that spirals toward a deadlier threat. All of this movie was so well-done, and there’s nothing that I would have done differently for a first Avengers movie. It more than accomplished what it set out to do, and the most amazing thing of all, is this was only the beginning.",5
"Jan 1, 2025",Avengers is a spectacle to behold and has plenty of of on screen charisma to engage you,4
"Dec 30, 2024","Enjoyable to be sure, although it maybe hasn't aged quite as well as some early Marvel. The action becomes brain numbing after a while and the constant quipping rather hit and miss.",3.5

"Dec 24, 2024",One of my favorite super hero movies ever.,5
"Dec 23, 2024",Definitely recommend it,5
"Dec 15, 2024",This movie is a great introduction to the Avengers as a team on the big screen and the movies before it perfectly introduced the team slowly. I have no big gripes with the movie besides the post credit scene Thanos and how he looked very bug eyed otherwise this movie is a perfect movie to watch as the whole family.,5

"Nov 18, 2024","It is definitely an excellent movie. You should watch it at any time, even before you die. It is a great movie, especially in terms of visual effects, character development and acting. It is a very good and high-quality movie. It also has sequels and 2 new movies will be released, and the last 2 movies of the sequels were beyond great. But as the first movie and as a start, it is a logical, beautiful and high quality movie that you should watch whenever you can.",4

"Oct 22, 2024",It was one of the best superhero films out at the time. This was a time before they started ruining the stories with political messages and other politics.,5
"Oct 14, 2024",It was one of the best superhero films out at the time. This was a time before they started ruining the stories with political messages and other politics. Long story short it was before they started following the same downward spiral as the comic book industry. This was back when they wanted to tell good stories to the majority of its audience instead of insulting them.,5

"Sep 4, 2024","'Marvel's The Avengers' will always be the defining superhero movie of a generation, one that changed the entire landscape of superhero movies for better or for worse. It perfectly juggles it's complex characters and their development, is filled with action-packed hero-vs-hero fights that you'd expect, and culminates in a memorable finale that will have fans anxiously awaiting the next team up. Superhero films may not be loved by everyone in today's landscape, but to those who experience this one at the height of it's popularity, they will never forget it. Like the premise of this and it's sequels film, we assembled for it.",5

"Aug 27, 2024","Two's a company, Three's a crowd. And this one is too very crowded. With a predictable script, this film is very heroically star sprangled but for me it was a bore after the first hour watch.",2.5
"Aug 19, 2024",Totally epic movie. Always be a fan of Avengers.,5
"Aug 19, 2024","The costumes of the actors seemed to be very real, as if they were in their roles. The dress is really beautiful.",5

"Jun 4, 2024","Esse  filme é a transição para o sucesso na Marvel, sendo incrível e bom! Além de boa ação. O problema é ter um vilão como o loki que nem se compara a eles, além de ser fraco e encurtar o filme.",3.5
"May 31, 2024","Solid. It isn’t quite peak Avengers, and the pacing isn’t as exciting as later on, but this does what it should for the universe and characters.",4
"May 31, 2024","tem um desenvolvimento de personagem incrivel, atuação otima, efeitos especiais impecaveis a não ser pelo thanos no final, um vilão fantastico, e definitivamente um filme que fez historia, fez o genero de super heroi ser incrivelmente popular, mesmo os criticos normalmente não gostando de super herois deram notas altissimas ou seja, convenceu ate os do contra",5
"May 19, 2024",This movie works all around the board. It keeps the plot simple and adheres to the core of each character. Great acting too.,5
"May 18, 2024","Marvel nailed it with this one. 
Every character gets their time to shine and interact with each other, which makes for great laughs and memorable fight scenes. The villain and storyline are also perfectly executed, that also teases Thanos.",5

"Apr 30, 2024",A blockbuster cast with special effects and costume design that didn't age as well as earlier Marvel  films. RDJ and Hiddleston carry this one.,4
"Apr 21, 2024","I want to share with you a review of the movie ""The Avengers"", which was released by Marvel in 2012. The film is directed by Joss Whedon. The film's budget is $220,000,000. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgard, Samuel L. Jackson.
The story begins with an experiment on the Tesseract, an ancient relic that is a source of infinite energy at the base of the SHIELD, where Loki, the God of lies and deceit, appears from a portal. He takes possession of the Tesseract and forces Clint Barton and Eric Selvig to also declare war for the subjugation of the Earth. Fury then turns to the most powerful heroes for help, activating the ""Avengers Initiative"" to save the Tesseract and stop the attack planned by Loki. He unites Steve Rogers, Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, the Thunder God Thor, Agent Romanoff and later Hawkeye. Together they must fight Loki's army to protect the Earth.
The acting is excellent, I especially liked the performance of Robert Downey Jr., who played Iron Man. I had the feeling that he was not playing, but living this little life, getting tremendous pleasure from this image. I also liked the music playing in the film, especially AC/DC - Shoot To Thrill.
I really liked the ending, where the true character of Tony Stark is revealed very well. It was interesting to watch, and if you like the Marvel universe, then you just need to watch it.",5
"Apr 16, 2024",The entire movie was slow and repetitive. Nothing original or interesting. I skipped through most of it. But I did enjoy watching Robert Downey and Scarlet Johannson. So I gave it 2 stars for those two.,2
"Apr 3, 2024",It's a great start to the series. Plot is pretty good and implementation is great (like in most Marvels). Overall VERY solid.,4.5
"Mar 25, 2024","It is one of the best movies that Marvel has ever made and the film has it all; the jokes, action and beautiful visual effects for its time.",5
"Mar 20, 2024",I mean what else would you expect from Marvel. The prior solo films of some of the main characters led us to this point that will kickstart a journey unlike anything in cinema since Star Wars.,5
"Mar 17, 2024","Una película emocionante, que supo manejar a los personajes y adaptarlos muy bien, me encantó como desarrollaban y acababan con el conflicto, definitivamente marvel estaba en sus mejores momentos.",4.5
"Mar 16, 2024",Such a good movie with a classic adventures feel. i have seen this like 1000 times.,5

"Mar 7, 2024",The fun cast and simple exciting story makes up for a poor production,4
"Mar 5, 2024",Love it! The way they brought it all together in this movie and staged opportunities on where to go from here - enjoying MCU much more than I thought I would’ve.,5

Espero muito ver os Heróis mais poderosos da Terra novamente nas telonas.",5
"Feb 17, 2024","Groundbreaking for its time. Audiences now days may take team ups and crossovers for granted, but ill never forget the first time i saw Captain America face off against Loki, a villain from another franchise. Nor will I forget seeing characters stand united on screen together without any legal rights interfering. AND there's also the story which is also paced and balanced perfectly. Tom Hiddleston works his evil magic on our hearts.",5
"Feb 16, 2024","Outstanding storyline, great action, great actors.  What a great comic book team-up should look like.",5
"Feb 13, 2024","The culmination of ""Phase One"" arrives to much applause! A cinematic first to show that a collection of a shared universe of movies is possible, to which, many other studios would attempt to formulate themselves with their respective IPs. 

Marvel proved that it's possible to combine many different heroes together. Ensemble movies where you have to share screen time with many protagonists can be tough within itself, giving each their own character arc, all within a 2 1/2 hour timeframe, yet, they made it work. Granted, having most characters already have at least one movie beforehand to set the groundwork up for their character helps.

This movie is a fun movie all around!",5
"Feb 8, 2024","It didn't age well today in my opinion, too goofy and i have a different view on its director after Justice league",3.5
"Feb 1, 2024",The fact this has higher ratings than The Dark Knight Rises tells you that millennials that like this movie are betas and don't know anything about film,1

"Dec 26, 2023","One of my favorite movies of all time. That's pure nostalgia, but thinking back, this movie absolutely changed everything for the MCU, the superhero genre, and ensemble films. It showed that this connected universe thing is possible. I still love re-watching this movie, I can quote it all day.",5
"Dec 24, 2023","I especially loved the score of this film, I did it for marching band so ++ for nostalgia",4.5
"Dec 9, 2023","A well-made blockbuster with amazing characters, a focused storyline and great action sequences. The only issue with this movie is that it drags a little.",4
"Dec 5, 2023","At a time when the idea of superheroes teaming up was still an idea that many people thought would never happen in live action, this was a true event of a film. It was a lot of fun and the characters played off of each other very well. More lighthearted than some of the future Avengers movies, which both works for and against it.",4

"Nov 11, 2023","This is a great film! Every character gets their chance to shine and they all use their screen time well. RDJ, Tom Hiddleston and Scarlett Johansson give the best performances but the rest of the cast is still solid. The plot is great with plenty of action and comedy to keep you entertained. It's exciting seeing all the main heroes meet up for the first time. I also love how frightening/intimidating they made the Hulk out to be (I miss this version of him). Overall, this is a solid entry and definitely one of the MCU's best!",5
"Nov 11, 2023",Even after all this time I still remember the energy watching this in theaters. A little goofy but a nice way to show how much potential the mcu has. Everyone had stand out performances.,5

"Oct 12, 2023","After a significant build-up consisting of several movies introducing various iconic characters, Marvel finally delivered The Avengers, their big superhero crossover and the most ambitious comic-book movie adaptation at that time.

Directed by Joss Whedon, with an all-star cast portraying the likes of Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth), plus a long hinted-at plot that gets to the point right away, the film quickly broke a billion dollars at the box-office and it remains one of the most popular movies of all time. Marvel's bold, expensive move paid off, to say the least, and comic-book movies are still just as big as they were back in 2012, some would say more so.

Seeing all these characters together in the same film was certainly a main draw for audiences but without such a talented and dedicated cast, it's arguably unlikely that the film would have spawned as many sequels and spin-offs as it did and led to the continuation of Marvel's (and Disney's) comic-book movie domination. The story sees Loki (Tom Hiddleston) use the Tesseract to open a space portal thereby allowing all sorts of villainous creatures into the world as Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles his team of Avengers to stop him.

Keeping the plot simple was certainly a good move as anything more convoluted than that could have gotten pretty messy. On the other hand, having the film just be about a one-dimensional villain we've already seen in another movie use a macguffin for some vague megalomaniac endgame he doesn't even seem all that devoted to, makes The Avengers feel a little slight depth-wise. Loki himself isn't quite as interesting as he was in Thor but Tom Hiddleston keeps him charming and fun throughout. Most of the enemies the Avengers face, however, are faceless no-name aliens and are only there to be disposed of. 

One third of the film is dedicated to introducing characters old and new like Bruce Banner/The Hulk, played by a perfectly cast Mark Ruffalo, the middle part follows Loki's escape and the Avengers having to deal with that, while the finale is just one big New York City-set battle. The film is long but it's paced well with key action beats and, whenever the heroes are interacting with each other, even if they're just standing around discussing exposition, it's a joy.

The Avengers isn't a perfect film. As I mentioned earlier, it isn't exactly a challenging watch, which is both good and not-so-good but altogether understandable. It has quite a few ropey moments, especially near the beginning when Loki shows up to brainwash Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), or whenever some alien thing we don't know is talking next to a glowing staircase somewhere on a space rock, or when a joke doesn't quite hit the mark. And it's a shame that Loki never gets a final fight against all the Avengers or at least his brother Thor.

Instead, he just basically gives up about halfway through. This is a slick-looking movie with some impressive CG effects (Hulk looks great, mostly) and it's never dull but the cast really is the glue that holds the whole thing together: Robert Downey Jr.'s wit, Chris Evans' earnest heroism, Scarlett Johansson's super-spy antics, all of that comes together beautifully and it effortlessly fleshes out characters you wouldn't necessarily expect to care this much about, let alone at all.

There's no denying what a huge achievement The Avengers was. The fact that Marvel planned out such a ridiculous project so meticulously and it somehow all led to a genuinely solid, entertaining blockbuster is worth celebrating. The film itself is slightly uneven but it's so full of charm and boasts enough cleverly put-together set-pieces that, for any comic-book fan especially, this is simply a treat.

Excelsior!",3
"Oct 10, 2023",Yeah i like this movie a lot,4.5
"Oct 7, 2023","For all the MCU newbies out there, this is a MUST to watch. This movie introduces all of the OG Avengers, and you aren't a Marvel fan if you didn't love this movie.

Loki as a villain was so entertaining into me probably the best performance in this movie Iron Man, Captain America Thor, black widow hulk, and Hawkeye were all interesting, and had a character arc of reuniting as a team and they did that really good. The only problem that I have with this movie is just a joke. It was too many jokes, but they balance out the jokes with the seriousness, and made sure he didn’t feel like a parity of itself. This was a really good movie, and where the MCU became a cultural phenomenon 9/10",5

"Aug 30, 2023","As someone who isn't a fan of The Avengers, I wasn't expecting this movie to this good!, thanks to a script that is emphasized on a characters weaker aspects, The Avengers came across as sympathetic & likable not to mention this movie's way too engaging and entertaining, definitely a great movie for hardcore Avenger fans & a fantastic movie for casual fans.",3.5

"Aug 7, 2023","Peak superhero media, the absolute best of the Marvel movies. The Avengers is consistently entertaining and thrilling from start to finish. It is brimming with quippy, clever dialogue, and an undeniable charm. Every bit that is hokey adds to the flavor of this film, from the cheesy costumes and forced jokes, to the tryhard nature of some of the action, which has ridiculously memorable choreography and moments in every sequence, I might add. This is an absolute treat of a blockbuster. It seems there will never be another movie quite like this one, and that's a shame.",5
"Aug 5, 2023",Fantastic Movie. Loved the cross over. A great way to end the 1st phase of the MCU.,4.5
"Aug 4, 2023",I was blown when all of them came together after gradually building them up throughout the years of phase 1. This movie is a total classic when they face a world ending threat together. Still definitely one of the best movies in the MCU! Loki being the villain and the post credits scene of thanos making his debut into the MCU were astonishing!,5

"Jul 9, 2023","Serviceable direction, great acting, and it's cool to see our characters come together. However, most of the best material for this movie is in the deleted scenes.",4.5
"Jul 4, 2023","Simply awe inspiring 
They said it could never be done but marvel bought together what many believed could not work as a movie 
And they knocked it out of the park 
Not only dose every character get a chance to shine but the writing is so strong that when they all come together you get a feeling of such natural chemistry that at times you forget your watching a comic book movie 
To see how far these kinds of movies have come is nothing short of a modern day film miracle as for the first time in a long time audience are given more then was promised to them and then some 
But you have to wonder at this point how much more Dan a cast grow in number without this fine Original quality becoming lost 
How many more times can the avengers unite before the genre starts to show ring rust",5

"Jul 2, 2023","As a ""putting the band together"" movie it does its job, but honestly, I know action is a big feature of superhero films, but this has two enormously extended action scenes, one at half way and one at the end, and I think they're both far too long. The middle one is at least interesting enough, but the final extended fight scene is just what feels like 45 minutes of CGI bashing and explosions. It didn't need to be that long, and they could have instead put more character and plot development into the film.",3
"Jun 30, 2023","Overrated flick, the action keeps disappointing, the characters are strange, nonsensical plots, lame music. Just empty.",2
"Jun 28, 2023",The movie is an cinematic masterpiece that not only serves as a sequel to every other marvel frachise in existence but also finds ways to combine each character of different genres into one cohesive narrative.,5

"Jun 16, 2023","The movie changes aspect ratios pretty often which can be distracting. It's a good movie that explores the meeting of the main heroes of the Infinity Saga, but it was a bit jarring how they all went from hating each other to suddenly fighting together so quickly at the end.",3.5

"May 16, 2023","The Avengers was meticulously crafted and well thought out. There was careful consideration taken in every element, every plotline and every piece of dialogue, which is can be positive but also negative. Because it was such a monumental cinematic moment, it seemed as though the filmmakers were doing everything possible to not mess it up and therefore did not take many risks. That being said, the film itself is fantastic. Seeing Earth's mightiest heroes fight side by side give you goosebumps, there are genuinely funny moments and the plot moves forward logically. However, compared to later films in the MCU, The Avengers just seems a little too safe.",4.5

"May 9, 2023","The Avengers is one of THE BEST action movies I've ever watched, and I HAVE to tell everybody who will listen that. Now that I've seen it, it's hard to express how excited I am. I deliberately steer clear of building myself up for movies because I find that when I do, nothing really seems to be able to live up to my expectations. I typically steer clear of hype trains whenever I can. Having said that, I was quite excited to watch this movie and was entirely on board with the buzz. It was unavoidable. I could have been severely disappointed if this movie had been bad. I'm overjoyed to say that the exact opposite has occurred.",5
"May 8, 2023",It is such a classic 👌,5

"May 5, 2023","This movie blew me away when I first saw it back in 2012. Never in my right mind would I imagine that this many( at the time)comic book characters would work so well together on the big screen. Well, we have come a long way since then. Even though it keeps slipping down my ranking of best MCU movies it still is an enjoyable movie.",4

"Apr 12, 2023","This movie has great pacing, great chemistry between its leads and has the perfect level of corniness for an MCU movie. Loki in this movie makes a great villain and the dynamics between all the heroes is so well thought out. Also there are some really creative combo attacks from the main characters. The flaws for me are that the first few minutes are kinda lacking and some of the jokes are really cringe, still a good movie",4
"Apr 10, 2023","The 1st Avengers movie is a thrilling

The film's seamless blend of humor, drama, and high-stakes action makes for a truly entertaining experience. The chemistry between the cast is fantastic, with each character bringing their unique personality and skills to the table. The special effects are top-notch, bringing the epic battles to life in stunning detail. The only downside is that some of the character development feels a bit rushed, but overall, The Avengers is a must-see for any Marvel fan or lover of superhero movies",4

CGI, I think that the CGI is amazing. Villain, I think that Tom Hiddleston has done a great job with portraying Loki but Loki is more of a bad guy than a villain. Writing, the writing is perfect. Story/Plot is amazing aka perfect. Casting is a solid 10/10 no one can tell me something different. Characters were all great I love them all. Adventure is great.

"Mar 26, 2023","The world loves it, though I still think the original ""Iron Man"", ""Thor"" and ""Captain America"" were my favorites.

At this point, ""The Avengers"" has made around 100 trillion dollars (or so)--and so it's obvious that people love the film. My own daughter went to the premier in New York and then went to it on opening night in general release--and was mad I didn't take her with me tonight to see it! Obviously, she loved the film as well. As for me, I liked it but didn't quite share the overall exuberance for the film. Mind you, I liked it--but I think I preferred the earlier films before the Avengers team was formed. There was a certain charm that I didn't quite see recaptured in the film. Now the film is good--it's just that what I like in these other films I would have liked more of in ""The Avengers"". Specifically, the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development. When I read the IMDb trivia, it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutes--all showing Steve Rogers (Captain America) trying to adjust to his new life. I would have LOVED seeing all this--and less of the HUGE battle at the end of the film. For me, it just felt numbing after a while and I would have liked more of the characters when they weren't fighting. Again, however, I DID like the film....but the earlier Marvel/Disney films I liked just a bit better. Just my two cents worth...",3.5

Muy buenas y prometedoras escenas de acción y efectos especiales que se llevan toda la atención. Definitivamente una de las mejores películas de Marvel. Mi calificación final para esta película es un 10/10.",5
"Feb 28, 2023",A great movie to bring together the heroes in phase 1.,4
"Feb 24, 2023",Perhaps the greatest superhero movie of all time. Each character gets their due screen time without having to compete for it. This movie set the standard for every Marvel film that came after it with enthralling heroes and one of the few truly bewitching antagonists.,5

"Feb 21, 2023","""The Avengers"" is a 2012 adventure/action film directed by Joss Whedon and starring an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Chris Evans as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. The movie follows these superheroes as they come together to save the world from an alien invasion led by the villainous Loki (Tom Hiddleston).

One of the strongest aspects of the movie is the chemistry between the cast. Each actor brings their own unique take on their character, and their interactions with one another are both humorous and engaging. The film's action scenes are also impressive, with a mix of practical and digital effects used to create thrilling set pieces.

The plot is well-crafted and engaging, with a good balance between action, character development, and humor. The movie does a great job of juggling its large ensemble cast, giving each character their own moment to shine while also moving the overall plot forward.

The direction by Whedon is confident and assured, with a strong visual style and a keen sense of pacing. The cinematography by Seamus McGarvey is also impressive, with a mix of handheld shots and steady compositions that give the film a sense of energy and momentum.

The musical score by Alan Silvestri is a standout, with a memorable main theme and well-placed motifs that help to elevate the film's emotional moments.

However, the film's villain, Loki, can feel somewhat underdeveloped at times. While Tom Hiddleston brings a sense of charisma and wit to the role, the character's motivations and backstory are not always clear, making him a somewhat one-dimensional antagonist.

Overall, ""The Avengers"" is an entertaining adventure/action movie that succeeds in bringing together some of Marvel's most beloved characters on the big screen. With strong performances, impressive action scenes, and a well-crafted plot, it is a highlight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a must-see for fans of the franchise.",5
"Feb 18, 2023","Super-powered buddies in tights beat up a jokster and some aliens.

At the time of its release, it was probably the biggest movie out there. It was a culmination of years of hard work and movies building up to this precise moment. Everyone was talking about it. 

Looking back now, it's a bit corny (I'm talking about Captain America's suit).

It has a nice balance of humor and action. The Hulk is the best part. It's a solid film.",4
"Feb 17, 2023","An excellent end to phase one. This movie made Iron Man 2, Thor, and The Incredible Hulk worth watching.",4.5
"Feb 17, 2023",Best movie of the franchise.,5
"Feb 15, 2023",The Avengers is a amazing way to set up this team of heroes!,4.5
"Feb 14, 2023","""Avengers: Endgame"" is currently ranked as my forever favorite over the accumulated weight tying together 21 different movies into an interconnected franchise's 22nd chapter. This is certainly the fourth occasion that reflect past events during a required assembly when a threat too great overwhelms singular ability – while being more as a responsive effect to its penultimate preceding first parter being the cause snapping up world-changing proportions. ""The Infinity Gauntlet"" two-parter is an inspired continuation after the previous team-ups consisting of the core members mostly given their own films and established arcs with their dynamics greatly tested and challenged, positioned to evolve their placements. Of course, none of this wouldn't be possible without the solo heroic outings, or to an extent of pairings and exclusively involved team-up, building up towards the ultimate play while connecting others along the way for familiar dynamics at least from another. But the first time it happened was the independent studio's first goal as a visionary promise that became cinematically groundbreaking as well truly define what the Marvel Cinematic Universe is capable of through the interconnected strengths. It was right then that ""The Avengers"" became my favorite movie for opening pathways that led all the way to ""Endgame"" and solidifying its shared universe concept's success – despite being stretched thin elsewhere.

While superhero teams aren't anything new as the ensemble already been witnessed theatrically, mainly under Marvel and other secondary or lesser-known comics for exploitive gimmicks, what makes this special is the hype stemmed through the shared universe concept Marvel adapted onto the screen. It broke their descending reception in reaction to subpar qualities till they were financially capable of independent filmmaking. This started when producer and president Kevin Fiege announced their goal in 2006 to bring the core team-up to life. Considering the main entertainment value for ""Iron Man"" providing general welcoming without prerequisite reading of the vast comic lore, the ultimate crossover film mainly relies on the audience who stuck around across the connected films, but the name itself is the comics' peaks of characterization being respected and taken onto different arcs outside of their comforting knowledge. ""The Avengers"" is the pinnacle of both Marvel and the cinema by storytelling combination at a perfect balance.

There's a quote that defines the team's ‘s reason to come together and assemble: ""And there came a day, a day unlike any other, when Earth's mightiest heroes found themselves united against a common threat."" On that day, Thor's evil brother Loki obtains the energy cube called the Tesseract, tapping into its unlimited power in opening a portal to unleash his given army to enslave humanity. Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., must re-activate his recruiting initiative of bringing together a group of remarkable people that could fight the battle no one else could. Teaming up are non-team player Iron Man, an awakened soldier Captain America, a pursuing god Thor, a monstrously temperamental recluse Hulk, secretive assassin Black Widow and marksman Hawkeye, whose mind got controlled under Loki's spell. Different backgrounds varying in humanity, strengths and weaknesses as well as beliefs, they all must work together with trust in order to defeat a common threat.

The former four starred in their own films, while the latter two were introduced as supporting players – it would be nine years later till they received their own starring projects, but each of them evolved as part of the overall balance of finally tying them all together than just the simple assembly. Continuing from their established arcs, they each carry the weight that push them on these heroic paths that they may began to truly accept as their responsive professions while working with different individuals they wouldn't normally work alongside unless the dire situation pressures otherwise. Before his true colors were exposed in another certain project whereas he practically made himself comfortable by recycling what he inserted inferiorly, Joss Whedon showcased his skills at a peak with quite a capability of advancing pop culture from experience. Directed and written it, which positions him as full-on storyteller with confident direction that matches the brand's vision as he flawlessly fulfills it through impeccably scripted buildups of seamless dialogue referencing fresh hefts from polished arcs as slight transcendence. He achieved a proudful reception over his treatment and meeting expectations that either hinted towards planned projects or ambiguously reveals unseen details. He watched the other films carefully and perfectly mix them all into one to fuel excellent exchanges excitingly ranging timeless humor and captivating tensions.

Aside from the characterization being the elementally prominent focus, this film outlines the list of essentials that Whedon seems to must've demonstrated under an assorted definition. Obviously proven successful with the set pieces amazing as supportive backdrops to the events, the action sequences justifies and thrills awesomely specially when notes been taken from previous chapters (i.e. Hulk chasing Black Widow in the Helicarrier like the horror setting in his film taken place in the factory of continuous obscurity), all backed up by Alan Silvestri's riveting music that switches some notes from his previous venture under retrospective focus and introduced one of the most iconic themes that eventually recurs (upliftingly to the ears). The visual effects help color the film's own stance next to its preceding narrative carriages while remains constant without trimming any edges. In addition, prompted cinematography looks for unique ways to signify these dynamics as they move onto each other with nuanced contribution, and also compliments with the written direction helped by well-timed editing. In summary, an event like this provides standardization underlining hard-to-beat and the notion of synergistically saving the best for last, or later in this case.

Adding on to both storytelling and technical efforts is the ensemble cast's performing just brilliantly with most at their second rounds as their characters with opportune gravitas for further exploration, and certain few embodies their characters effortlessly at their third and fourth rounds. Joining the mixture are Cobie Smulders as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria Hill and Mark Ruffalo taking Edward Norton's place as Bruce Banner. Like the rest of the cast without questioning the casting choices, even going as far to include the recasts, perfection gets determined by the performances, and so it did when Smulders nicely adapted Hill in live action after the character shined in animation – which is actually where a number of these characters gotten introduced priorly. Norton signed up as Hulk for Marvel's potential horrific corner only for that to be occasionally glimpsed, luckily felt and appreciatively grasped still but not enough for his satisfaction. When Ruffalo took over, the character's captured mannerism slightly changed just to flex Ruffalo's own charismatic talent in, managing to make the character his own with equally defined energy.",5
"Feb 6, 2023","My writing is about the Avengers movie, the first movie of the 21st century that was not cartoonish.

"Dec 4, 2022","An All time Classic. The idea of taking multiple heroes from other films and putting them together in this way had been attempted going back to the Universal Monsters of the 30's but they couldn't really figure out how to make it work cohesively. What started 9 decades ago was mastered with this film. The actors all have incredible chemistry, witty dialogue and excellent performances across the board. The cinematography is very good with very well done special effects. Even the end battle which is very heavy with CGI is very clean and well done even though you can tell most of it is computers. The battles between the Avengers themselves are amazing to watch and super intense. The only real downside to this film is the musical score is good but it's not really memorable or catchy like Superman 78' or The Dark Knights, but it's such a small point. The editing and pacing are both fantastic in this. The only serious downside is this is a film that requires you to watch 5 other films before this to understand how good it is. But it is absolutely worth it and even without watching the others you still can tell how good it is. Everyone should give this a try. This is a Landmark Film for being the first to nail how to do multiple characters from different franchises into one awesome unique experience.",5

It is basically just a giant final battle for over 30 minutes, but it still works. Unlike Man of Steel, which has a similar final battle, it being that it lasts for like an hour, this last act is actually fun and creative.

"Sep 2, 2022","This is a relatively decent superhero (Marvel) action/adventure film, with plenty of visual effects and numerous fights/battles to keep teens watching, although there is also a fair amount of lengthy dialogue scenes too, in between the more action-based scenes, which may put some off. I don't claim to be especially knowledgeable (i.e. much at all) when it comes to the individual details/background/history of the various characters that come together to become the Avengers (not the 1960s British show starring Diana Rigg, I hasten to add). However, I can't say it's not entertaining in parts - it is and the CGI is fairly good. Perhaps not entirely as realistic as other films but then this is a superhero and perhaps part sci-fi based film, compared to a disaster film or straight drama. 

I did feel that, at times, the script felt a bit too overly cheesy but then I don't suppose I'm the main/intended demographic (a 37-year-old lady). I quite liked Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury, the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. who brings the various characters together to form the Avengers - he plays cool and sassy/suave characters with ease. This is not the sort of film I'm likely to want to watch again or that will stay in my mind much but for what it is, it's not bad. A little long and slightly lacking but overly its fairly good, so I'd recommend it on that basis.",3.5
"Sep 1, 2022",One of the best fanfare comic book movies ever. Movie has a good story and started the ensemble phase for comic book movies.,5
"Aug 27, 2022",Everything about this is perfect blockbuster spectacle cinema. Except Captain America's outfit.,5
"Aug 21, 2022","With great care for each of the mainline characters (Hawkeye still isn't a mainline character a decade later), The Avengers showed the world something we had never seen before, the culmination of a cinematic universe. It's bright, it's fun, but it's not without flaws.",3.5
"Aug 18, 2022","Filme foda, gostei do roteiro, o elenco é ajuda muito bem no filme, e as cenas de ação são excelentes, e a cena mais legal do filme, foi quando os vingadores formaram um círculo em volta do alienígena do loki e no fundo tocando a música dos vingadores. É um filme que eu recomendo muito.",4
"Aug 15, 2022","While better then most movies in Phase 1 of the MCU. I do not think it ages well. The 1st and 2cnd acts are boring to me. The 3rd act is one of the best MCU scenes though. I think it is overrated.
I love the 3rd act so much, It's truely S tier.",3.5
"Aug 12, 2022","The whole cave collapse was the worst part, and that says not much because everything else is much better.",5
"Aug 10, 2022","The Avengers movie was alright and definitely good for it's time. If a movie of this standard was released today, it would still be a hit, just not to the levels we've seen in the MCU. Still a good movie overall.",4

"Jul 31, 2022","Para mim esse filme é o exemplo perfeito para um filme de herói, boas atuações bom desenvolvimento o tom para as piadas e perfeito, e o cgi também e excelente esse filme e uma obra prima dos filmes de heróis.",5
"Jul 22, 2022",The film just works in many ways that other ensemble films seem to be unable to. I like it quite a bit.,4.5
"Jul 16, 2022","What an event this was, so good even in 2022!",5
"Jul 15, 2022","This movie is just so fun. It definitely has some stereotypical superhero moments and stuff, but a fantastic set of characters and a fantastic villain propel this movie upward. It balances comedy, action, drama, and adventure very well and packs a lot of plot and growth into a single movie.",4.5
"Jul 14, 2022",This film gives an end to phase 1 which built up to the moment where the Avengers unite as a unit to fight a big bad which became Loki. The film is truly one of the best shot and acted of any Marvel film giving each character a story and giving us a reason as to why they each were chosen bringing something different to the table to build a strong unit.,5
"Jul 13, 2022",My favorite marvel movie,5
"Jul 12, 2022",Absolutely classic. Tells a great story that formed the best batch of heroes. Love the ways the characters developed in this movie and it definitely setup the infinity saga greatly.,5
"Jul 10, 2022",Perfect and aging like fine wine. I really consider this Iron Man 3 Tony gets so much character depth and thrusts him forward the future of his character.,5
"Jul 9, 2022","The Avengers brings together six superheroes from four franchises into one epic movie, and the result is absolutely spectacular. Each character is given a chance to shine, there is well-written humor, and a compelling villain. Well-choreographed action scenes complete a near-flawless movie, ending with a final battle on a grand scale and an emotional resulting scene. While I wish some plot points were explained more, The Avengers is a film that flies higher than a Helicarrier.",4.5

"Jun 26, 2022",A very good movie but the part that they need to fix the airport aircraft is so boring but the villain is good and the final battle is good too,4
"Jun 23, 2022",It's just the usual jumble of marvel avengers action/ fight scenes/ weak plot/ too many characters. This was first in the series and it set the script that all the sequels followed. Really it's a total mess but fans of this type of thing will find plenty to amuse themselves here. Scarlet is the real upside here. Wow as usual.,3
"Jun 23, 2022",All of the Avengers movies are great including this one! Fun to watch but isn't something I would re watch  a lot mainly because the others are better.,4
"Jun 22, 2022",Such a good start to the avenger’s this movie was the perfect movie to get people hyped for the future of marvel 9/10,4.5
"Jun 14, 2022","Very iconic movie, still holds up 10 years later. Although not as good as the Avengers movies we love so much later on, this movie is an absolute classic and brings in our favorite superheroes together.",4.5
"Jun 10, 2022",This is the movie that started the MCU going bad. A decade has made it clear that this movie is one big gimmick with little emphasis on plot and characters.,2
"Jun 9, 2022",This movie is better than all solo movies,4.5
"Jun 8, 2022","Me recordo mucho a superman II y la épica pelea en nueva york.Creo que toma muchos elementos de la misma. en suma, Mi pelicula favorita de superhéroes de todos los tiempos",5
"Jun 2, 2022","To give a positive review to The Avengers is basically a cliché. When it first came out, it was an absolute landmark; practically defining what cinema would be for the next decade. And, a decade later, it still holds up as one of the best blockbusters and superhero movies ever!
The chemistry between the cast is impeccable, every character gets their fair share of screen time, the action is imaginative, and the score is awesome! 
The movie does have some issues. I personally don't think Loki is the best Avengers level threat and sometimes the effects do get a bit dodgy towards the end. But those are the only flaws I could possibly find with this film!
It is a miracle that this movie came out as incredible as it did, and it's an even bigger miracle that it still holds up to this day as a generation defining film!",5
"May 21, 2022",There is some part that i want to skip.,3
"May 21, 2022","this is a movie with great comedic timing, great dialogue, and believable cgi that makes you immersed in the world and it also sets a very good story about iron man and his eventual self sacrifice thankfully he lived tho",5
"May 18, 2022","Daora, gostei bastante",4
"May 17, 2022","Everything from the build up, the music, the camera work, the tension, was spectacular and felt like an amazing culminating finish having these particular characters group up for the first time. Every lead actor/actress played their part perfectly, personalities clashed and together they grew to overcome a threat. Bonus points go to the wardrobe department for their amazing attention to detail. (EG. Cap wearing clothing that represents the clothing people wore before he got frozen)

I believe this film to be when the Iron Man suit looks most realistic and less CGI based. 

Overall, amazing movie that I believe will be timeless.",5
"May 13, 2022",The Avengers is absolutely the biggest MCU of all time is really epic and entertaining film of 2012.,5
"May 11, 2022","LOL, funny and for ages 13+ only!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5
"May 7, 2022","esse filme e um classico, recomendo",5
"May 7, 2022",One of the few Marvel movies that stands as a decent film in its own right. Watching this in theaters was one of a few moments in which I realized that the MCU could be something more than popcorn movies (even if this is still largely a popcorn movie). The action set-pieces are top tier for modern movies.,4
"May 4, 2022","It may be nostalgia talking but this movie has developed into everything I want to see in a superhero team up movie, super satisfying watch!",4.5
"Apr 28, 2022",just amazing this movie is!,5
"Apr 28, 2022",looking forward to watching it for the 37th time,4.5
"Apr 28, 2022","This is pure comic book fun. The characters, along with their actors, have perfect chemistry together, even when they are bickering against one another. The third act is incredible to say the least and every character, no matter how small, has a charming soul that just attaches the viewer to this universe.",5
"Apr 25, 2022",10/10 it was beautiful. It is funny and serious at the same time. Love Loki and Tony.,5
"Apr 25, 2022","this movie set up everything for cinema crossovers, this movie has a great cast, great story, villain is amazing they should have added the deleted stan lee cameo, but its still a great film. Loki is amazing, and its tough to count your entire movie on a guy that has been two indie movies before this. 
Great movie recommend it",4
"Apr 22, 2022","I can't give this a perfect 5 out of 5.  Besides the heavy lifting scenes of Robert Downey's Iron Man, and before we get the best rendition of the Incredible Hulk ever put to film in that electric third act?  Pretty mundane and average, to be honest.  Even if ultimately a memorable movie going experience.  At times feels like a TV movie in terms of aesthetics and cinematography.  RDJ drags Whedon's material to a greater sum than its parts.",4.5
"Apr 21, 2022",What a fun movie to see. I have been waiting for decades to see these characters presented so well. This honors the source material and I loved every second.,5
"Apr 18, 2022",A great film to start the Avengers Franchise in MCU,4
"Apr 10, 2022","A thrill ride, this was the superhero movie that unseated Batman Returns as my favorite comic book movie. That same feeling I get from going on a rollercoaster I got from seeing this in theaters. Very fun from start to finish.",4
"Apr 6, 2022",Great movie! The MCU is awesome and it was great to see the Avengers get together for the first time. Loki seemed a bit out of character but I guess they needed to do that in order to make him the actual villain of this movie. I suppose it also helps to have the excuse that the mind stone was manipulating him like it did to the avengers in that one scene.,4
"Apr 3, 2022",An awesome team up movie.,4
"Apr 2, 2022",The first time they Unite. The Avengers beats down everything with great performance and solid story development therefore creating something to watch.,5
"Apr 1, 2022",Great movie that brings the avengers together on the big screen for the first time.,4
"Mar 31, 2022","As a smaller kid, the best movie of my youth",4.5
"Mar 18, 2022","Definitely one of the more cinematic MCU films. The way this film changed the landscape for blockbusters is incredible. This was truly the film that showed what Marvel Studios is capable of. CGI, script, and performances are all tremendously high in quality. Standouts include Ruffalo, Hiddleston, Johansonn and Jackson.",4
"Mar 11, 2022",So boring. Bad CGI. Terrible Plot.,0.5
"Mar 7, 2022",Instant classic. Still my favorite comic book movie of all time. Love this movie.,5
"Mar 7, 2022","This movie still stands out as an amazing film. It is action-packed, hilarious, and entertaining throughout. The first fifteen or so minutes do feel like they are of much lower quality - almost TV quality - than the rest of the film, and some of the actors - I'm looking at your Christ Hemsworth - had not fully found their character yet. That is why it loses half a star for me.

Rating - Great",4.5
"Mar 4, 2022",The movie was ultimately a cliché rolled directly out of a rushed cinematic universe. The magic and creativity of Marvel was gimped into a not-so-funny lackluster movie that eventually led to this. Though the historical impact this movie had in team-up superhero movies is ultimately the longest lasting legacy I am happy this movie paved the way for.,1.5
"Mar 3, 2022","B+ ~ At the time of release, this movie an experience since it was the first time superheroes each with their own solo film came together in one giant film. Re-watching this though, some of the goofier elements get in the way of the story-telling. At times, it feels like every character is a clown and the quips never stop. Still have to give this movie respect for what it achieved and for what it paved the way for.",4
"Mar 3, 2022","This movie is not as good as everyone thinks. Yes, it gets better towards the end but the first hour is really boring. The performances are bad, especially for Tony and Steve.",3
"Feb 23, 2022","This movie did something that had never really been done before, had a nice, but comparatively small build-up to what we have now seen, and was a great kick off to the subsequent MCU phases.",5
"Feb 22, 2022","This may be my favourite stand-alone MCU film. From its interesting characters, threatening villain, hard-hitting action, element of espionage, and of course, heart, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" serves as a more than worth sequel to and for ""The First Avenger"" and a memorable entry into the MCU.",4.5
"Feb 16, 2022",A really good start to the MCU,4.5
"Jan 28, 2022",Just perfect and gorgeous!!!,5
"Jan 27, 2022",My rating for the film is a 8.7/10,4
"Jan 27, 2022","An entertaining spectacle of superhero team-up flick with character drama and quaint quips.

Director Joss Whedon's superhero action-thriller The Avengers (2012) is sure to please all viewers seeking enthralling action, but disappoint the Marvel fans wanting stronger character arcs like the individual hero movies. I loved the thrill of watching all of Marvel's greatest superheroes team up together in one movie. The Avengers surely is a great accomplishment and a thoroughly entertaining one from Iron Man fighting Thor to Black Widow evading The Hulk. The Avengers is nearly all action among the cute character interactions. Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor are all better made movies with stronger character development, stories, writing, and direction. 

Whedon brings Marvel's comic book superheroes to life all for a massive brawl in New York against Loki and some goofy aliens. The action sequences are exciting and well thought out with several memorable moments. I just found Whedon's overall direction messy and lacking real depth for each character. He turns each nuanced superhero from the previous films and turns them into Whedon quip quoting machines. Everything is a punchline or pop culture reference suddenly.

Writers Joss Whedon and Zak Penn focus too much on the comedy and action and forget to give these characters detail, motivation, and nuance. It's all about the one-liner jokes and I think that severely detracted from these otherwise interesting characters. I appreciate that producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige planned this all out to get The Avengers to assemble in a way that makes sense, but I thought Loki's alien attack narrative is really boring and just an excuse to give The Avengers a horde of faceless enemies to destroy.

Robert Downey Jr. is very funny and charming as Iron Man as he gets to show off his quick thinking and scientific skills. Chris Evans remains a bastion of American patriotism and earnest heroism. Mark Ruffalo takes over for Edward Norton as the inner turmoil of rage that is Bruce Banner. His Hulk is really fearsome with cool action sequences and fun moments like Hulk punching the space whale. Chris Hemsworth's Thor loses his serious god personality and turns more into a joke spouting character, but his hammer and thunder powers are still killer. 

Scarlett Johansson is amazingly nuanced as Black Widow as she outwits every man she encounters and looks drop dead gorgeous as the redhead Natasha Romanoff. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is super cool and shines in The Avengers with her clever spy skills and combat prowess. She always feels genuine as Natasha Romanoff. I really do appreciate Scarlett still delivering excellence in dramatic acting as Black Widow, who may be my favorite aspect of The Avengers upon revisiting this beloved blockbuster.

Jeremy Renner gets taken over as Hawkeye, so we don't really get to know him yet. Tom Hiddleston's Loki is both scary and entertaining with his hateful smirks and cruel jests. Samuel L. Jackson is actually tough and commanding as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury. Cobie Smulders just appears as Agent Maria Hill, but she's fairly engaging. Clark Gregg gets quite the emotional farewell as Agent Phil Coulson. Stellan Skarsgård is wasted as Loki's science plot device. Gwyneth Paltrow is charming alongside Robert Downey Jr. I wish we got more time with her endearing Pepper Potts. 

Editors Jeffrey Ford and Lisa Lassek cut neatly around the fights, but it can all get lost in how chaotic the action sequences get. Seamus McGarvey has some inspired medium and close-up shots of each hero and them fighting alongside one another, but his wide shots are often really dull to look at compared to the more intimate spaces. The CGI is fine, but has moments that look pretty ugly, especially with all the washed out colors in every scene. Composer Alan Silvestri created an instantly iconic theme song for The Avengers. I really love Soundgarden's end credits song ""Live to Rise"" also!

In all, The Avengers is a very fun movie, that could have been much better honestly.",5
"Jan 24, 2022","Loud, tedious, mind-numbing, cartoony. Each superhero had their moment, and I liked the giant flying spiney machine dragon things in the final act, but overall I found The Avengers difficult to follow and the characters unrelatable. Not bad, but overrated.",2.5
"Jan 19, 2022","A great movie that does the modern superhero movie justice, staying true to its comic material with well written characters and story whilst providing extremely well done action scenes that feel grand in scale much like the stories created by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee",4
"Jan 15, 2022",The Avengers was a great way to combine all of the hard work that marvel studios have done. The character development is such a driving factor for this movie.,5
"Jan 14, 2022","You have no idea how INSANE it was seeing all of the movies and stories that came before it in the MCU tie together. There were definitely better movies, but still really good!",4
"Jan 11, 2022",Epic full of action and chatacters that everyone love.,4.5
"Jan 10, 2022",A bit messy at times but still an enjoyable marvel movie,3.5
"Jan 6, 2022",A classic and still holds up so well to this day.,4.5
"Jan 6, 2022","There is not a single superheroe movie with more epic moments than this one, of course there have been bigger blockbusters, but The Avengers makes us connect with the human side of our favorite heroes in such a compelling way that is easy to see why the movie was and continue to be so acclamed.",5
"Jan 2, 2022","Somehow a group of less-than-stellar films were then funneled chronologically into a team-up superhero film that broke records and our minds. Besides that, with a clever script and exciting action scenes, what seems like a short ride of a story ends up being fairly impressive. At its lowest, Avengers is still fairly decent.",4
"Dec 30, 2021",It was a very enjoyable series,4.5
"Dec 29, 2021",1 of the best movies,5
"Dec 28, 2021",O melhor filme dos vingadores de todos,5
"Dec 28, 2021","One of my favourite MCU movies was so awesome to see all the hero’s at the time come together even tho some don’t even like each other but come together for the greater good. The score and story was really well done it could’ve been really bad and is easy to mess up with so many characters but I felt everything felt fluent and natural, Tom Hiddleston really shines as does Robert Downey JR",4.5
"Dec 23, 2021",Brilliant set up for a brilliant franchise. Directed fantastically.,4
"Dec 22, 2021","Amazing! 

With this all-star cast, there's nothing that can go wrong.

"Dec 20, 2021",A dream come true for fans now it is a part of cinematic history,5
"Dec 16, 2021","Marvels The Avengers was a movie most comic book fans never thought would occur, and not only did it occur, but it lived up to all the expectations it had on its shoulders. This is a movie that needs to be watched, it is easily still one of my top favorite marvel movies, and it holds up to this day as a great film. While the plot itself is simple, the characters and actions scenes within this movie hold it together and make it a fun movie to watch, even with its dialogue heavy middle. This is a must watch again with Avengers Endgame coming up, as it is the first time these characters were brought together on the big screen. With its importance there, and Endgame being the final send off for Infinity Saga, I would be very surprised if this movie isn't heavily referenced at some point within the film. Go back and watch this film, you won't be disappointed.",5
"Dec 14, 2021","First time watching this one in years and it's still a lot of fun.  It was particularly fun seeing all these characters meet each other for the first time, and seeing Loki back when he was a straight villain.  Probably third in the running for Avengers movie behind Infinity War and Endgame, while miles ahead of Avengers 2.",3.5
"Dec 14, 2021",PERFECT!!! MY FAVORITE MOVIE MCU.,5
"Dec 11, 2021","Fucking awesome, a fantastic conclusion to Phase 1. 5/5",5

"Nov 15, 2021","One of the better installments of the MCU, ""The Avengers"" was a groundbreaking film that changed cinema forever by bringing together these different heroes for the first time. The entire film from start to finish is a blast and an enjoyment to watch, with very memorable lines and a strong performance from its entire cast. The comedy and banter in this movie lands, and the action, especially in the finale, in done very well.",4.5
"Nov 13, 2021","I think we all know how much this movie meant for all the marvel fans and it was truly a new experience. It was great watching the line up between these superhero's and how they work together as a team. The only thing that is bad about this movie are the too many jokes, every 5 minutes comes a joke and it really takes it off a bit.",3.5
"Nov 12, 2021",Molto molto molto bello,5
"Nov 11, 2021","In my top 3 MCU movies, the Avengers is witty, tightly-paced, sharp and gripping from start to finish. Balances multiple headliner superheroes deftly in a single movie, all of the heroes being likable, unlike in ""Justice League"". Could not commend any higher.",5
"Nov 11, 2021",It's the first trial of team-up by the studio and it turned out to be a classic one. Really like this film.,4
"Oct 29, 2021",The pacing is incredibly dull but the third act is worth the watch. Arguably one of the weakest films in the MCU.,2
"Oct 19, 2021","Arguably the best MCU movie, but by far not as good as Raimi's Spider-Man  trilogy and Nolan's Batman trilogy",4.5
"Oct 14, 2021","Of the ten that I have seen so far, The Avengers is one of the poorer Marvel movies. It requires a viewing of all previous Marvel films and even at that, falls short of the other ones. Its characters aren't as likeable, the humour isn't memorable, and it is by far the most confusing; at least of the ones I've seen. I'd say it is forgettable if it didn't appear to be so prominent in the Marvel timeline.",2.5
"Oct 11, 2021",Just...no. None of these Marvel movies are any good.,0.5
"Oct 5, 2021",This was a groundbreaking movie when it first came out and still its one of the best.,5
"Oct 1, 2021","Even with Whedon's taint on the film, it still results a fantastic experience.",4.5
"Sep 28, 2021",A fantastic movie and one of the best marvel movies ever made,4.5
"Sep 21, 2021","Josh Whedon may not understand how to make a justice league movie, but he knows how to make a marvel movie. The movie have an overall great plot. The cast is as always perfect in their roles. The give us moments and oneliners that are iconic till this day. The action scenes are amazing. All the charectors feel useful and needed, right from brute strengh to a tactical overwiew of the situations the heroes are in.  It's just a must see movie.",5
"Sep 19, 2021","The 2nd best MCU film. Filled with likable characters, Joss Whedon really directed a great movie here (I wish I could say the same for Josstice League), and the best of Phase 1. Highly rewatchable, and great performances really elevate this movie. 10/10",5
"Sep 17, 2021","Avengers is an absolute blast. Exhilarating action, great characters and a witty script makes The Avengers pure fun from start to finish. RDJ as iron man as usual he owns this role. Sam Jackson as nick fury kills it here as well, and all of the cast bring their A game. The Direction from Whedon is stellar and he really does a great job in bringing together this whole cast and the action sequences are filmed really well too. Overall this is my favorite out of Phase 1 MCU The avengers is a really fun time from start to finish and makes it a must watch for comic book fans. Grade A-",4
"Sep 13, 2021","Where it all began, Marvel's The Avengers did what no other movie dared to do, having a large ensemble of heroes, a lovable villain and having an at the time original arc of having the team learn to work together. It's your average run of the mill blockbuster, but a hell of a one at that! Without a doubt this movie's greatest achievement is its all star cast and the chemistry they share, from the charismatic Robert Downey Jr, to the stoic and comedic Samuel L. Jackson, every cast member is perfect in their respective roles and the way they bounce off of each other is just remarkable! The VFX are also outstanding, most of them have aged rather well. This movie does have one glaring problem however, and that is the middle act. It's nowhere near as enjoyable as the other two, its incredibly slowly paced, and doesn't impact the plot is almost any way. All in All, Marvel's The Avengers is just phenomenal in every way. All you can do is marvel at this work of art.",4
"Sep 8, 2021",THIS movie was seriously something else some awesome scenes i  love how you get a taste of evryone vs everyone for a brief moment awesome movie 10/10,5
"Aug 31, 2021","Entertaining but there's absolutely nothing about these Marvel movies that puts them above and beyond. They are all over budgeted, over acted, over PRODUCED, and just worn out.. Marvel is nothing but clichés in cash grabs anymore— GET ORIGINAL.. I wonder who wins in the end?? Robert Downey Jr, please come back to real movies, you're so much better than this crap.",2.5
"Aug 30, 2021","Overrated. The gathering of everyone and action are breathtaking for the time, but the plot is too mainstream. Loki is definitely not as well-executed as in Thor. The pacing is unbelievably off, with both the slow parts and the battle taking way too long.",4
"Aug 29, 2021","Very good movie, but also very corny.",3.5
"Aug 25, 2021","In this epic culmination to the five films prior, you get everything from thrilling action to interesting character development. Easily, one of the greatest Marvel films of all time.",4

"Aug 9, 2021","80/100 GOOD movie, a Classic",4
"Jul 26, 2021","An incredible film that has all aspects it needs to create a fantastic superhero team that compels you right from the beginning and till the end of the film. It has a basic yet smart plot with surprising scenes and ideas along with one of the best soundtracks, character connections and breathtaking sequences that seem hard to bring all in 2 hours, but this film does an incredible job in entertaining you from the story, comedy and action for the entire runtime",4
"Jul 26, 2021","It was great to see Marvel bring back the original Avengers.  The movie was extra good in special effects especially the Flying Aircraft carrier. The only characters I never cared for was Hawkeye from Marvel and Green Arrow from DC, the reason why, no matter how many times they both shoot arrows, it appears as if the Arrows on their backs are always full!",4.5
"Jul 23, 2021",Smiled the entire time in the theatre.  Launched the MCU into a level it never came down from.,5
"Jul 19, 2021","The Avengers is a movie that could've easily been a mess and turned out to be a masterpiece thanks to Joss Whedon. The movie nicely culminates the five ones that came before it in the MCU and gives all of the Avengers moments to shine. The action is fantastic, the visuals raise the bar for future MCU films, and the movie ends on a high and satisfying note that leaves plenty of room for future character development and storytelling. The script gives each of the Avengers moments to show us who they are and how they fit into this broader universe. Loki is a great villain for this film due to him being a familiar face and having a direct connection to one of the Avengers, and Tom Hiddleston again gives a strong performance as the character, which is all bolstered by the script giving him a few moments to shine and one-liners as well. The acting in general is good, with both new and familiar faces doing the best they can with their roles. Renner is done a bit dirty in the film, but the big battle redeems that slightly and Renner makes the best of the screen time he has. Unlike some previous MCU movies, this one has lots of rewatch value and will still be entertaining to many on multiple viewings. Overall, The Avengers was a fantastic first culmination for the MCU and set the bar very high for future movies like it.",5
"Jul 18, 2021","One absolute amazing feature film.
Thrill,  Action, intensity,  wit, tech and an evil character that you'll love to hate.",5
"Jul 17, 2021","The movie changes aspect ratios pretty often which can be distracting.
It's a good movie that explores the meeting of the main heroes of the Infinity Saga, but I'll never understand why they all went from hating each other to suddenly fighting together so quickly.",3

"Jul 16, 2021",Electric and also rapidly nostalgic. It doesn't happen that often these days where you're finding yourself wanting more. Sequels usually are the demise of a very good original. This saga gave a lot  and could of done possibly more before it's End.,5
"Jul 16, 2021",This movie came out with a BIG BANG!  Fans loved it and what really can I say about it that hadn't already been said.  Great Movie! Check it out!,5
"Jul 15, 2021","Such a fun movie, maybe not as good as later films, but the characters weren't as developed yet. The one that brought the group together and ""started"" it all though, classic.",5
"Jul 10, 2021","Awesome movie! Love the action. Surprisingly, I never once felt bored throughout the entire thing, even though the final battle is a good half hour or so, and the entire movie is pushing 2.5 hours. Other superhero franchises (if there are any left besides the DCEU) really have something to learn from this movie.",5
"Jul 7, 2021",While a fairly easy to follow and pretty good special effects I couldn't find anything special about this movie. The cinematography is nothing great and just wasn't my thing but great addition if you follow this series and part of me thinks I could have appreciated it more if it was more my thing.,3

"Jul 1, 2021",This was good at the time cause no one saw anything as big as this before but its lost its touch,1.5
"Jun 27, 2021","The original avengers movie was very popular and still is. Highly requested after you watch all the movies titled after the “original 6” before 2012. Compared to other MCU movies, this isn’t as good as a couple of them, since the MCU barely miss, and they definitely didn’t miss with this one. This brung one of the most popular marvel characters to this day.",4
"Jun 22, 2021","Marvel (Kevin Feige) did a great job at doing and setting up this movie. They didn't rush into it like Warner Brothers did, they took their time and waited for the perfect opportunity to make and put this movie out. I stand by every decision that was made in this movie, except anything to do with Josh Whedon. Marvel will always hold a dear spot in my heart, and this is one of the movies that I will always think about when I hear Marvel!",4
"Jun 9, 2021","A coming together of individual unique people with mind blowing capabilities, and a good story to tell while not getting too distracted by the eye candy, makes this a spectacular thrill ride you'll want to take again and again! EXCELSIOR!!",5
"Jun 3, 2021","Great movie that brought the avengers and their incredible actors together in a movie with one of marvels top villains, Loki.",5
"May 26, 2021",The Avengers was one of the best movies I've ever seen. The plot was good and interesting. Loki was the perfect villain for this movie. The avengers were put together perfectly. The score of this movie is good. The acting is perfect. There wasn't a single second that I didn't enjoy. All in all i give this movie a 5/5 stars.,5
"May 26, 2021",Hulk was the best part of the whole movie,5
"May 22, 2021",One of the best superhero movies in existance.,4.5
"May 13, 2021","This movie is not as good as everyone thinks. Sure, it gets better towards the end but the first hour is really boring. It's not just because there is a lack of action because that's not true at all. In fact within the first hour or so there are four fight/action scenes. But the way they are brought about are almost laughable. 

The movie gets good once the hulk transforms on the helicarrier. Scenes aren't lit very well and it almost looks like a episode of firefly. But it's not. It's a huge action blockbuster with a budget in access of 200 million dollars.

You can say whatever you want about Joss Weadon. Whether you love him or hate him I just don't think he's cut out for these kinds of movies.

The characters have fine chemistry but they aren't given enough time to shine either on their own or as a team. Some of the action is fine I guess but there are certain scenes where I cannot tell what's happening at all. To prove my point watch the Thor and Loki fight scene on the top of Stark Tower. 

Overall Avengers is painful for about an hour and then slightly bolster for the remainder of the run time. Would have to wait at least three years to watch this again.",2.5
"May 7, 2021","This film was really fun. This was a start of something that no one really knew that it was even possible. Just seeing all of these guys teaming up together for the first time. There are some VFX that really hold up and there are some that don't. Any way or another the characters of this movie are just fun to watch and really are good throughout the films Loki was really the most fun Marvel villain that they had until they reached Phase 3 and there were finally some good challengers. This movie was the start of something that really could've not work. But the fact that it does really goes to show how much taking your time and plan things out really help you and could do you really good favors. This was actually the first Marvel movie that I watch, and i'm pretty sure this was everyone else first time too. I don't remember it specifically but I do remember watching it at home when it came out on DVD and I think it caught my interest. I of course didn't know who any of the characters are at the time but I remember being at the very least interested. But any way this movie was great. 10/10",5
"May 7, 2021","Love it top 5 marvel movie
Ensemble that worked and didn't leave me wanting more of specific characters",4.5
"Apr 30, 2021","Unlike DC, the Marvel filmmakers know how to make a ""team"" movie and cast the characters accordingly. The nice balance of so many lead characters mixed with a ton of information and action/comedy/sci-fi is something to admire starting with the writers. With epic camera shots and outstanding VFX, this film is one hell of a start to the Avengers franchise.",4.5
"Apr 29, 2021","The film ""The Avengers"" manages to present us with a good script, although with one or two holes, it has a good costume for the time of its release, it has a good original song, the film's CGI is competent, with only a few lapses on the part of the Chitauri army, and in the end what saves the film is the final fight, which entertains the audience very well.",4.5
"Apr 29, 2021",I'm not a 12 year old child so won't fully appreciate this movie but it passed the time adequately enough.,3
"Apr 28, 2021","The Avengers was the first movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that I learnt about. Everyone was going crazy. Meanwhile I, who didn't know the basics of comic book superheroes, was wondering why are Superman, Batman and Spider-Man not on the cover of this movie. Just a few years ago I watched all the movies from the franchise when Infinity War came out just to know what the fuss was all about. And now that I see it, I understand why it was such a huge deal.

After the events of Thor, Loki comes on earth to steal the Tesseract from SHIELD, and he does manage to do that. Meanwhile all the superheroes are getting their own relations straight so that they can team up and fight the bad guy. All the characters are shown to be in the places where they had been at the end of their respective movies. Although what they are doing is not very interesting, it is somewhat a realistic deptiction of what kinds of characters they are. And then they all come together, beat Loki and save the day. A pretty straightforward story moved by character development.

There are a number of things I like about this movie. The scene where their airship's propeller stops working so Iron Man spins it so fast that it stabilises. It showed how strong and fast Iron Man is. There was also the scene where Iron Man goes through the portal and throws the missile away. It completely contradicts what Captain America considered him to be, showing how his character developed over the duration of the movie. I also like how Tony goes to have a word with Loki and tells him that the Avengers have a Hulk against his entire army. I mean I could literally go on about what a badass Iron Man was throughout the movie.

Then there were Thor and Hulk. I really liked Thor ever since I first heard of him. He literally looks like a Norse god capable of highly destructive powers. Hulk, on the other hand, I didn't like him very much when I heard about him. Even in The Incredible Hulk he wasn't really entertaining. But here he actually feels like a very strong guy who has been trapped in the body of Bruce Banner. He gets angry every time someone calls him Bruce instead of Hulk, which shows how much he is struggling for his identity. Thor is just as awesome as I thought him to be. I always have a soft spot for superheroes who wear a cape.

The visual effects were done really nicely. Though the impact of their powers wasn't very hard, but it's a campy movie. What can we possibly expect? It's from an era where every fight scene needed to have a comic relief who would tell jokes in the middle of the fight, be it Gimli from Lord of the Rings, Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars or Hound from Transformers. But the destruction was surely visible. Most of the shots are done from the point of view of a bystander. That is something I really like; it's literally the reason why I like Monsterverse. It is seen especially in the scene where Hulk rides the giant snake robot.

Though there are a lot of things that I didn't like about this movie. First of all, the campiness. Obviously in today's time it's quite an easy thing to dismiss saying that back in 2012 movies were meant to be campy as the superhero genre hadn't been utilised properly, but the very same year The Dark Knight Rises came and the next year Man of Steel came. Both of them had the mature touch to it. Even the MCU movies before and after this one like Thor and Captain America: The Winter Soldier looked more mature than this baby thing. The other criticism I have towards this is Black Widow and Hawkeye. I hate botht he characters, and even more I hate how they are easily beating bad guys who are clearly stronger than them.

The jump cuts of this movie are also very annoying. Every fight scene, especially the ones which have Black Widow in them, have like, a dozen scene cuts just to show that Natasha did a cartwheel, got on the bad guy's shoulders and snapped his neck. The same goes for Captain America and Hawkeye also. Not even once has Hawkeye shot anything in one take. It's something that can be easily shown even with a stunt double.

Obviously this doesn't look special anymore, since I watched it after Infinity War had released, so there wasn't much of a surprise other than the fact that it's a team up movie. It has a good place in my memory so I wouldn't want to rewatch it and tamper its reputation. It's good in its place, it's a product of its time. It should stay that way. It's a one time watch in case you haven't seen it.",4
"Apr 22, 2021","The avengers has one dope team of superhero's. while the sequences are epic as well The sequences with Thor, CA and the hulk are especially kick A and RD jr. is pretty good as iron man although I've only seen parts of iron man and not all the movies but I could tell he is good and is a bit humorous.",5
"Apr 19, 2021",Excellence...The only improvement would be to re-cast Mark Ruffalo with any other person on the planet.,4.5
"Apr 12, 2021","Nonstop entertainment, but not much in terms of highbrow stuff.",3
"Apr 10, 2021","Great climax to the first phase with the culmination of all the previous films yet without feeling like an ending to the saga. Loki is a much improved character feeling more like a villain than a whiny little kid. I'm pretty sure everyone got goosebumps when watching them stand together to the amazing theme by Alan Silvestri. The near death of Tony Stark feels touching and is done well. My only real quarrel is how it leads onto Thanos too much even though Marvel had already made plans for the next Avengers film to be Ultron. This is the main reason that Avengers: Age of Ultron had such disappointing reviews. However, that aside, this is a great movie that finally delivered what all Marvel Comic fans wanted to see.",4.5
"Apr 9, 2021",Top 3 superhero movie of all time,5
"Apr 8, 2021","The Avengers stars amazing characters Iron Man,Captain America,Thor,Hulk,Black Widow,Hawkeye and Nick Fury and they must come together to defeat Thor's evil brother Loki.Marvel managed to put so many characters into one movie and it worked perfectly well. I love this movie with it's visual effects, the action and it was great.",5
"Apr 8, 2021",The first meetup of our favorite heroes!  The conflicts between the personality and interests of the characters is interesting throughout and when they finally team up it's amazing!  A classic superhero movie for the ages!,5
"Apr 6, 2021","The character chemistry and conflict really work. The action scenes are great, especially the last big set piece and Alan Silvestri’s score elevates it all. The patient setup of the previous movies allowed this unprecedented cinematic triumph.",4.5
"Apr 2, 2021",Joss did a good job balancing out the characters with each other. The story was above average but the awesome character moments make up for that. The VFX are top notch! Howe ever this film lacks cinematography or any good action choreography. Also Captain America's suit went from cool in his solo outing to really lame in this one!,3
"Apr 1, 2021","The movie that kickstarted an entire sequence of events of universes, team ups and inspired many creators to the idea that a team up live action comic book movie isn't just a great Comic book movie, but a great movie overall!",5
"Apr 1, 2021","The only thing I can rate as a negative is the fact that Thor is a god, & should be treated as such. The fact that they think he would not finish Stark in a fight is laughable. That just tells me they are doing it for the fans & the fact that we liked RDJ.",4
"Mar 31, 2021","Saying this is a great movie is an understatement. Bringing together a great cast from wildly different movies and making it work under one cohesive narrative is a feat not many movies can pull off but the Avengers does! The acting, narrative, and action are outstanding. This is the greatest comic book movie of all time. It's a must see!",5
"Mar 30, 2021","If not for the overly saturated and at times unnecessary moments that took away from the seriousness of this film perhaps I would be more at odds against the villain. However I found myself rooting for the bad guys to win. Avengers by Joss Whedon is an overhyped film made ""great"" only by the unity of several iconic characters. Its a shame that this movie couldn't even take itself seriously",1.5
"Mar 29, 2021","AMAZING!!!

I RECOMMEND TO YOU ...",5
"Mar 26, 2021",Avengers is exactly what everyone was hoping for and more. It's the perfect conclusion to Phase 1 of this epic franchise.,5
"Mar 24, 2021","Still one of my favorite superhero movies by Marvel, or even by overall. This was an AMAZING introduction to the Avengers franchise, and I loved every second of it!",5
"Mar 23, 2021",Porquería de película,1
"Mar 20, 2021","Very good superhero movie, I mark a before and after of this. Lovable and very well developed characters, Loki as a villain is the best there is in the UCM, the long-term work brought very good results for Marvel.",3.5
"Mar 19, 2021",An overrated blob of shit that I fucking love,4
"Mar 19, 2021","Despite the avengers looking like a bunch of people doing cosplay in the most hilarious way, this movie did a pretty good job bringing this team together, although we didn't get back stories for 2 of the avengers the movie found an amazing way to cover up its errors and make it a pretty enjoyable film, comedy and cool battle scenes, the film really delivers to the audience, so I would recommend this film, I wouldn't call it a masterpiece because the shots were plain and simple",3.5
"Mar 16, 2021","Yes, Iron Man started it all and we can't be thankful enough to Jon Favreau for fighting tooth and nail for RDJ. But, before The Avengers, there were five movies, interconnected, it's true, but they were still separate, nonetheless. The average box office gross of those was 460 million (not bad, but nothing compared to present day MCU standards). And crossovers were at most ideas and desires. But then this movie came out and the film industry was never the same again. It was a game changer, a milestone and arguably the most important film (not the best, just the most important) since the original Star Wars. Now everybody wants to be like Marvel. Joss Whedon hit the mother of all jackpots with this one and he proved that it is indeed possible to do something like this.",5
"Mar 16, 2021",The Avengers (2012) is the first time we ever saw all these classic Marvel heroes assemble for the first time and it pays off in a great way. This is an instant modern classic for the superhero genre.,5

"Mar 1, 2021","One of the best superhero movies of all time. It has it all: emotion, strong story, action, comedy. The team up of all these characters is epic and so well done. Very close to a near perfect movie",5
"Feb 28, 2021","OMG I love this film! It's goofy, amazing comic book fun that I'm down to watch any time. Everyone in this movie is a memorable, likable character with individual traits who I would watch all day (minus Hawkeye and a few side characters). The interactions these people have are just the most amazing thing. Loki is the perfect villain for this movie, he is intimidating and cheesy at the same time. But, the best part is the action. I can only describe the action as the inner 12 year old inside you jumping up and down screaming excitedly. The story is goofy and doesn't make a whole lot of scene, but The Avengers is still a great time that perfectly sets up what's to come.",4
"Feb 21, 2021","Outside of Whedon's stigma, which does linger in this movie in its own ways, The Avengers is a blast of a polarizing superhero movie. It sets up Iron Man as a true hero, while also introducing what causes his ultimate struggle. The tension in the team is palpable, and the fantastic cast make it work. Loki is such a cool villain and the special effects and jokes hold up well. A fantastic movie that is still a blast, with at least one subtle ""oh s-!"" connection to a later movie that I just noticed.",4.5
"Feb 19, 2021","Decent movie, recommendable.",4
"Feb 18, 2021","The first outing of the Marvel Cinematic Universe ensemble of super hero's sees Hawk , Black Widow , Iron Man , Hulk, Thor and Captain America work together to fight against an alien invasion led by Loki ( Thor's [adopted ] brother ) who is intent on ruling Earth.

"Feb 10, 2021",The Avengers at first when I did watch this movie I thought it was an alright movie I did not like a lot of things that happened in it but I just rewatched it and I enjoyed a lot of it u don't get bored when u watch it pretty much all the character are great but not Loki also Loki is one of my least characters I like that Nick Fury recruited the avengers in different ways that was cool also I am not a fan of bruce banner in this movie I wish we had bruce banner from The Incredible Hulk also two negatives and I think there It is a little bit too long but after that this is one of the best MCU movies made I am not  big on the MCU but this is a good movie what they brought us in 2012 the ending is the best part of the movie So all round the villain could of been better and wish that they brought back the other bruce Banner after that this movie is great so I give The Avengers a B+,4

"Jan 30, 2021","I've been a fan of the superhero genre since I was a child. Superheroes fascinate me because they have superhuman abilities and they can accomplish amazing feats that a regular human can't. And what I like more than a movie with a superhero is a movie with multiple superheroes! I love team-ups. When I first saw this movie back in 2012, it blew my goddamned mind. The scale of it, the number of superheros, the CGI. I honestly believed this movie was the peak of superhero movies and that nothing will ever beat it. In retrospective, I was of course wrong... Fortunately.

Not only is this movie very good on its own, but the fact that there was a build-up to it from the previous movies that also established our main characters makes it even better. I watched all the other movies that lead up to The Avengers. I absolutely love the cohesion of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",5
"Jan 23, 2021",Alot of great battles thru out the film only downfall is it wasn't filmed with a 3D camera so the effects are not very polish,4

"Jan 1, 2021","The Avengers has very little story, yet I don't think that is what it needs to make it a good film. Since it is the pinnacle of Phase One of the MCU, being their first big crossover event, the character interactions, action scenes and humor make up for the weak premise.",4
"Dec 31, 2020",The avengers is a good movie but with this film it got slow and boring in the first act . The second act was bit wasteful until shield helicarrier  fight but the third act was good.

A perfect blend between the screen time of everyone. Also, the recasting of Bruce Banner sparked a new era for the character. Mark Ruffalo IS The Hulk. A beautiful ending and a post-credit scene that sets up the rest of the MCU as we know it. The CGI of Thanos in the post-credit scene was laughable, but that's ok. Grade: 98% (A+)",5

"Jul 11, 2020",This movie is just so much fun. It has one of two villains in the cinematic universe that has personality at the forefront.,3.5
"Jul 9, 2020",Recuerdo perfectamente cuando se estrenó. Fue una la mejor cinta de superhéroes de su tiempo.,4.5
"Jul 2, 2020",First movie you see with all these major superhero's together on one screen.,5
"Jul 2, 2020",fantastic thrill ride of a movie,4
"Jun 30, 2020","Quality Marvel story flawed heroes, cool villain, crazy technology and mega battles all in a seem less cinematic envelope.",4
"Jun 29, 2020","Awesome movie, remember when it came out to theater, that hype and ideas to see comics heros coming to the big screen has been amazing.",5
"Jun 27, 2020",Awesome film. I really liked this film a lot. My 2nd favorite film of 2012.,4.5
"Jun 23, 2020","They landed it perfectly. Feige's integrate planning of doing this crossover film with all characters having back-stories set up in the last 4 years. Choosing Joss Whedon who crafted a balanced film for all characters to shine. Everybody thought it was a big gamble and would fail as story will be all over the place. Feige ended up inspiring all studios to create their own shared-universe.

The movie is slow at start, but it builds effective foundation for character to bond relationships - Tony&Steve relation was played so greatly that looking back it feels like nostalgic ride of their past flaws - 'Everything Special about you came from a bottle',
'You are not the type of guy for the sacrifice play, lay down on a wire, let the other guy crawl over you'

Loki returns, his set up from Thor was perfect. He did play a good villain but could have been better thinking now that he has become kind of good, his movitations of jealousy was mere for New York destruction. Head canon of mind stone damaging his attitude could work. Loki using tricks to pit the avengers against, with Banner hulking out, was great.

Mark Ruffalo did Banner perfectly. His CGI is one of the best. Banner & Hulk relation was explored a bit. Him getting recruited to study tessaract(infinity stone) as it gave of gamma radiation was perfectly tied for future Blip Snap.

At first Natasha didn't feel that much but she kicked a tonne of ass. Her relation with Barton as friends was set up good. She did not feel any less dangerous than Thor at the end.

I liked Thor the least, yeah he was brother to main but he didn't add that much to the table. Taika & Russu did him much better cuz Hemsworth got to be himself.

The hour long action is great for fan service and assemble scene gives me goosebumbs time to time. For action fans this is great but I am more a fan of 'dialogue between actions'. Actions make this movie highly rewatchable as it has comedy spinkled away

Samual L Jackson nailed Nick Fury, Coulson's death was good for movitations. Acting wise, all got the job done, nothing special.

Comedy is much less in these movies than future but they do crack me up time to time, Puny God, We have a Hulk, Shawarma, Tony is god of giving nicknames.

Tony's character arc was good but future has much more for his character to evolve to. Thanos at the post credit scene was a great set up. 

A great entertainment some people, for me these are more than blockbuster movies, these have heart, great characters with storylines spending much more then 1 movie. Inherently rewatchable cuz I am a nerrrd.",5
"Jun 19, 2020","The big one they have been building up to. The visuals are great. The villains are good. All the performances are great. The Cap gives a better performance here then he does in his first film. The emotion is there with the death of SHIELD agent Colston. And the music is good. Some fantastic one liners and it's fairly memeable. This is pure Marvel through and through. 

""Now would be a good time to get angry."" 

Banner:  That's my secret Cap... I'm always angry.""",4.5
"Jun 17, 2020","Marvel's: The Avengers, directed by Joss Whedon, started a revolution for the superhero genre, being one of the most influential superhero films of all time! This is the first time we were able to see all of our favorite heroes in one film, fighting for the same goal, and it paid off tremendously, making 1.5 billion dollars at the box office! Whedon is one of the best directors the MCU has on the payroll, due to his understanding of what the MCU is about, while using his knowledge, and the films before to his advantage.

The plot is pretty straight forward, while allowing for many notable character moments. The film doesn't take itself too seriously, which works because there is quite a bit of cheese riddled through some of these scenes and pieces of dialogue, but Whedon still managed to create a fun, and cohesive narrative. The Avengers broke some barriers that the MCU has set in the past, by adding a few dark and grittier moments, but still managed to keep a steady tone, with a pace that's all gas and no brakes. The only thing that Whedon could've done, is give the team some type of vulnerability, so the stakes are higher, but other than that, this was a great showing of what the MCU is all about!

This is probably one of my favorite character based films! There is just so much talent on screen at all times, while equally sharing the spotlight. Every one of these top notch actors came to set, ready to play ball! Each character was fleshed & balanced out nicely, while everyone's emotional connection was well understood, while having great chemistry amongst one another. Robert Downey Jr. was of course, great in this film! Even though he's transforming into a team player, instead of a lone wolf, he still possessed that snarky, witty, and humorous charisma that everyone has come to love. His banter with Captain America is surprisingly a good twist, because of how genuine the dialogue and emotions feel as they deliver their lines. You can't help but admire Chris Evans as Captain America. If his performance in The First Avenger wasn't enough, he absolutely puts all of his doubters to rest with his performance here! Cap steps in as the leader of the group, while the writers added such a likable style to his character, by making him oblivious to the new age, and his subtle humor at times. Chris Hemsworth returns as Thor, and he is so much more likable this time around! He adds this sense of dominance in every scene he's in, while also having tremendous chemistry with everyone on set. We have to talk about the biggest stand out of this film, and that is the new comer, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and The Incredible Hulk. Ruffalo's take on the characters was a true breath of fresh air, undoubtedly being the best portrayal yet! He brings this charm and wit to the character, while also giving him some vulnerabilities, that the other Hulk's never had. Ruffalo is such a talented actor, with great depth and range, making a massive statement as to why he belongs in the MCU. With not knowing much about Black Widow, I wasn't too sure on how she was going to size up with the rest of the Avengers, but Scarlett Johansson puts on a great performance as Natasha Romanoff, having more to do than usual. She isn't afraid to get her hands dirty when it comes to the action, while also having a great mind for the team. We finally get more on Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, and it's safe to say that he isn't really the most interesting out of the bunch. He has a few good individual character moments, and a few good scenes with Johansson, but he just doesn't fulfill that Avenger feel. Sam Jackson thrives as usual, having more to do, while having a bigger impact on the outcome. Tom Hiddleston as Loki, returns as our main antagonist, and he absolutely steals every scene that he's in, bringing this mischievous persona, mixed with some deep emotions and sophistication! Loki poses a real threat, with a true motive, unlike every other villain we've seen already. The Chitari is fine for what they are, but they're nothing that memorable.

The screenplay by Joss Whedon (not Zak Penn) was the best yet! It had it's silly moments, but it was mainly filled with consistent humor and wit, with deep, emotional dialogues, that helped build all of our characters tremendously. Whedon added this amazing banter between all of the characters, that felt as genuine as can be.

The action through phase one was fine, but it wasn't really anything spectacular, but The Avengers wanted to go out with an ABSOLUTE BANG! From the middle of the second act and on, everything was so high octane, having memorable action sequences, backed up with one of the most well know scores by Alan Silvestri. 

Overall, Marvel's: The Avengers is one of my favorite movies of all time, let alone of the MCU! With all of these characters being fleshed out more, with great writting, and story telling, The Avengers made a huge impact on what's to come for the saga, and super hero films in general.",4
"Jun 14, 2020","Rewatching this movie I discovered foreshadowed heart and humor I had never noticed before, this was a turning point in the MCU for a reason. -Izzy Meth",4
"Jun 10, 2020",One of the best movies Marvel has ever done,4
"Jun 8, 2020","""The Avengers"" is one of the best MCU films. Managing to give protagonism to all the characters of the team and have epic scenes throughout the film that could not compare to annithing seen so far in this universe. With a soundtrack that makes the film even better, it manages to give importance even to secondary characters such as Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) and Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg), not to mencion that it has one of the best villains that the MCU has ever scene.",5
"Jun 7, 2020",Funny. Good action sequences.,5
"Jun 4, 2020",I love it. The first Avengers movie is also one of the best. Loki was the perfect villain for this movie. It is so fun to see the Avengers meet each other. The dynamic works. Their chemistry works really well too. Nick Fury was really good in this movie too. What a great start to superhero team up film.,5
"Jun 2, 2020","This movie is a masterpiece. This is Marvel fulfilling their vision of a shared universe. Joss Whedon brings all these heroes together in the most satisfying way possible. Whedon is an amazing director, and this movie alone proves it. This was no easy task. Many other studios have tried to copy this like the Dark Universe, or the DCEU. Even though this is a movie combining superheroes from 4 different franchises, how many movies do you really have to watch before watching the Avengers? The answer is: 0. The Avengers does such a great job on its own establishing these characters. It is also one of the most enjoyable movies. The witty banter between the Avengers works so well. Whedon does a great job of presenting the theme of how people are stronger together. This movie perfectly demonstrates how being a team is more than just a bunch of people that are always giving each other nonsense, its about willing to put your differences aside to work together. Loki is one of the best villains in the MCU. The final battle is amazing, with so many cool moments, especially when the Avengers Assemble for the first time to fight against the Chitauri. This is a blast to watch and never fails to entertain. The Avengers is truly a classic.",5
"Jun 2, 2020","The anticipation for this film was huge, and it toatally lived up to the hype. The action is intense and no character is forgotten or left out, each gets their own moment to shine, and Loki returning as the villan is even better and menacing than he was in the first Thor film and delving deeper in to Infinity Stone storyline. With iconic shots and tons of eye candy, The Avengers welcomes the next phase to the MCU, giving Phase 1 the ending it truly deserved.",4.5
"Jun 2, 2020",Better than Captain America: Winter Soldier. A+,5
"May 30, 2020",This was an amazing culmination to the anticipation of this amazing idea that started with the bombastic Iron Man movie.  This was everything I could have hoped for as a kid growing up reading comics.  Josh Whedon is on fire here not only meshing the heroes together but infusing great comedic moments to add levity to the action.  And the action moments created seemed to be ripped from the pages of those comics I grew up reading.  A fun movie our family has watched multiple times since sitting in that theater as a 43 year old but grinning and laughing like i was 12.,5
"May 27, 2020","A great expansion, the visual effects on the final battle are incredible, they never leave to surprise me",5
"May 24, 2020","This is a fun superhero film. It has great acting, dialogue, and effects, all of which are essentials for a superhero blockbuster. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston and others all have great performances as various heroes and villains. Hiddleston's Loki is a great villain who doesn't overpower his opposition with brute strength, but with his wit. The script humanizes these characters and makes them all the more relatable to the viewers. The added moments of humor are a welcomed addition to an otherwise serious story. The set designs, whether CGI or practical, look great and help transport us into the heroes' world. This movie's action and spectacle are amazing. The fighting is well choreographed and often enhanced by context. This is not just a superhero film focused on big action, it has a lot of substance to it as well. Director Joss Whedon was able to craft a great comic book adaptation. Overall, I give this film an 8.5/10.",4
"May 24, 2020",A nerd's dream come true.,5
"May 19, 2020",this film really structuring the MCU does it extremely well IMO because of this film being the first ensemble film besides X men is so much fun 9.4/10,4.5

"May 18, 2020",An amazing way to bring all of these heroes together. It is a really risky idea that in my opinion totally works.,4.5
"May 17, 2020","The Avengers defined the true beginnings of what we now call the MCU. This was the first film in this juggernaut universe that launched the 'nerd comic-book understanding genre' and successfully applied and propelled that philosophy and transversed upon and thereby assemalated the rest of most all of the normal movie-going audiences going forward. In this age, we are now all nerds. Joss whedon did an unprecedented job and the chemistry among the characters is some of the finest there is and set the tone and standard for what the MCU would be moving forward. It isn't a perfect movie. It has its issues, but it ultimately worked and broke boundaries in its wake-",4
"May 7, 2020",Pretty good but not great movie. Cool to see all the big name actors on screen with each other for the first time. Took a while for the movie to get going.,3.5
"May 7, 2020","I still love watching this one to this day. It may not be as flashy as some of the other MCU movies but it was unreal to see these six on the big screen for the first time. No one knew if this could be possible. Having this many superheroes in one film. Loki is at his best in this one. I kind of miss the old, Avenger days.",4.5
"May 6, 2020","‪The visual effects aged horribly. That being said, still a textbook example of how to do crossovers right.‬",4.5
"May 5, 2020","It was very interesting watching this movie again after seeing the conclusion to the MCU. Compared to the concluding films of the franchise, Avengers feels like it is cobbled together. A lot of the dialogue felt stilted this time around and very unnatural. I still really love this movie and it brought back a lot of nostalgia, but it isn't as good as I remember it being.",4.5

We hadn't seen anything like it. Looking back on it now, the plot just kind of revolves around the heroes getting together, but regardless, it's a fun time. Sure it doesn't hold up as well as many people remember, but it's still a good movie. Not to mention, it was just the end of Phase 1 and the beginning of Phase 2.",3
"Apr 24, 2020","This is undoubtedly the best first team up movie in superhero movies. Only one of its sequels was better than it.

"Apr 20, 2020","Uma das melhores junções de heróis já feitas, com momentos épicos e uma atmosfera única.

Diversos elementos nesse filme funcionam muito bem. Temos personagens que, por si só, já são interessantes e carismáticos, e esse até então não era o desafio. Acontece que o roteiro sabe muito bem como conduzir a visão de cada um sem que isso parecesse forçado, na realidade, até se acrescenta ao personagem. Isso fica muito mais evidente para quem assistiu os filmes subsequentes e percebe muito bem referências que são, na realidade, futuras a trama. Loki é super carismático e fez com que amássemos o odiar, ocupando perfeitamente o papel do vilão. O início da relação entre o Cap. América e Tony Stark é no mínimo intrigante, e cada um parece ter sua verdade em determinados momentos.

Se tem uma coisa que funciona bem aqui é o alívio cômico. Nos pega em momentos certeiros, são bem engraçados e quebra o clima pesado - que não é o propósito do filme. As cenas de luta são boas de modo geral, com claro destaque aquelas onde o plano é mais aberto e se utilizam dois ou mais heróis, combinando seus poderes; é lindo e extremamente satisfatório de se ver. A OST é marcante e funcional. Emociona e representa muito bem a equipe. Os efeitos especiais são excelentes para a época e convencem muito bem.",4.5

"Feb 7, 2020","History will remember Avengers, but not because it's a good movie. It'll remember it because it was an incredibly ambitious one, succesfully managing to serialize cinema, make stand-alone flicks connect and form bigger stories. That's something worth applauding. What's not worth applauding is the movie's plot, for sure, which could be summarized in one sentence: ""a bunch of heroes team up to defeat a bunch of CGI aliens trying to take over the world"".",2.5

"Feb 6, 2020",This doesn't feel as rushed or CGI filled as the more current Marvel cinematic universe titles.,3.5
"Feb 6, 2020","+ For better and worse looks like a Saturday morning cartoon. Some really nice overall cinematography, even small scenes or FX heavy scenes look good. Even if it sets the series on a path of a fairly plain visual tone.
+ Also for better and worse has the plot of a Saturday morning cartoon which means it's convoluted and painfully simple at the same time.
+ Effects still hold up. Particularly Iron Man.
+ The way the title card comes in is a stroke of genius.
+ Ruffalo plays a pleasant to watch, snarky, smarmy smart guy who's so angry that he's a dick to everyone. It's a good choice even if he's a bit wrong for the role.
+ Powers booth!
+ Effortless and pleasurable connective tissue in the opening recruitment scenes.
+ Cool de-suiting at stark towers.
+ Stark with Potts is a good combination, great chemistry and I want to see more.
+Coulson nerding out is funny still.
+ There is a plethora of excellent dialogue and refreshing takes on the tropes.
+ All the super fights are excellently choreographed slices of comic book action. No battle fatigue, inventive etc., even in the third act.
+ ""He's adopted?""
+ Science bros.
+ Dialogue really flows well, feels organic, important and full of character layers. The repartee particularly between Tony and Cap feels tense and equal and riveting at times.
+ Good use of aspect ratio. Appropriate.
+ Having to explain the nerd stuff to someone who enjoys it anyway means it hits both ways.
+ Much better than I remember. It has aged well.
+ Good closing shot. 

- Gift and curse of Whedon's dialogue is that sometimes it's brilliant and sometimes it's awfully cringeworthy.
- Some wonky or hacky directing.
- Sort of lame opening chunks before the team assembling.
- I just don't like Sam Jackson unless he's playing Sam Jackson. Here he's not. He's playing sneaky, grumpy Mace Windu in an eyepatch.
- Faceless, generic, blue-blooded fodder enemies.
- Quintessential sky-beam blockbuster third act. 

Early Post-Credits sequence review: 2/5: Thanos' reveal. Christ, I remember not knowing anything about this guy at the time. He looks ropey and doesn't say anything. Hard to love. Hard not to appreciate how much it changed things. 

Actual Post-Credits sequence review: 5/5: Shawarma. Now that's funny. Everone's so knackered, accomplished a great mission together. We've all been there. A good callback. Nonsense, but charming, and I love it. 

Stan Lee as: Old Man that doesn't believe superheroes are in New York. 5/5: Another perfect cameo, slotted in there well amongst newsreel and although it breaks the fourth wall a lot, it's a cheeky one delivered at the right time, the calm after the storm.",4.5

Everyone that starred in this movie were the right people for the characters they played. The story was well laid out and was very interesting. Whether you're a superhero fan or not you will love this movie. It'll blow you away and make you laugh. This is a definite must-see.",5
"Jan 20, 2020","Avengers 1 is an overrated theme park. Theme park is a phrase which means the filmmakers focused more on special effects rather than story, and it made the movie boring and bad. The opening scenes were horrible and were weird. You couldn't understand anything going on. It just happened and it was confusing. Only people who read the comics would understand what happened. Thats not very good if you are trying to get non comic book readers into the superhero genre. The acting was bad except for Iron Man, Thor, and Loki. Chris Evans showed no emotion, Mark Ruffalo played Bruce Banner like an arrogant stressed out idiot, Scarlett Johannson didn't have emotion, and Jeremy Renner played Hawkeye where Hawkeye is very lame. However, Robert Downey Jr. did so good with Iron Man, and I can say the same with Hemsworth and Hiddleston with their roles. The movie was boring, the acting was mediocre, and it was an overrated theme park of a movie.",3

"Dec 31, 2019",Its a great conclusion to Phase 1 by having 4 popular superheroes in a crossover Marvel movie.,4.5
"Dec 30, 2019","This is one of the best-made MCU films, it took 4 characters who all had introductory movies before, and 2 relatively unknown characters and put them all together in this epic team-up action movie, and Joss Whedon executed this to perfection. I am seriously surprised by how good this movie ended up being, it is funny, the action is amazing, the characters get great development and the script was perfect. This 6 superstar Hollywood actors work so well together and play off of each other as best as they possibly could have, the chemistry is real and you can feel that through the magnificent performances. Mark Ruffalo was amazing as the Hulk and he brought the quiet and shy supergenius persona that compliments the Hulk, he was a very good casting for this film. Robert Downey Jr. is just as good as ever, you really feel the struggle within him starting to pull the team apart and he feels like something should be done and he takes charge of re-uniting the superheroes, I was very pleased with his character in this movie. Chris Evans is very quiet until the third act when he organizes the team and kicks some butt with them, he is so very good in the serious roles that he takes and I loved him in this film as well. Jeremy Renner was underutilized way too much, he is mind-controlled for the first two acts and he does'nt get to do much until the epic final battle, but he gave a decent performance and his relationship with Black Widow was very intriguing, I think that they have a great history that is worth exploring. Speaking of which, Scarlett Johansson really made had her breakout role in this film, she is perfect as Black Widow and is a very strong female role model, I enjoyed her contributions to this film even if though both Hawkeye and she were both not used as much as they could have been. Chris Hemsworth is a very good actor and he never gets enough credit for what he does, but starting with this film, his character starts to get really uninteresting and unbearably dull, his character does things that really don't matter, and they're boring to watch, but this film was only the start of his downfall, he is still pretty good. Samuel L. Jackson was surprisingly very good, his character actually did things that he just talked about before, it was great to see how respected and talented he really is, and Nick Fury has many layers that are discovered quite a bit, I loved his character development in this film. Tom Hiddleston is incredible, he is truly evil and wants to see the world burn, you get to see him setting up and executing his evil plan and you get to see how mad and delusional he really is, but he also can toy with peoples emotions like nobody business which was really investing to watch. Agent Coulsen is a great character and his sacrifice was exactly what the Avengers need as motivation to fight, it was perfect and Clark Gregg was very good. I loved seeing Stellan Skarsgard back from Thor, he is a great actor who I would like to see again in the MCU. All of the action is amazing to watch and it is all very entertaining, I loved seeing Thor and Hulk kick ass together, almost a premonition of their relationship in Ragnarok. This movie never drags, it is constantly throwing new problems at you and it is fun to watch these superheroes learn to work together and save the day, the script was excellent really gave every character depth, I sincerely love what this film did for these characters and how this battle of New York would be a crucial building block for all of these characters futures. I love this film and watch it a lot, it doesn't get boring and the script and character development were close to flawless, this is truly the peak of team-up movies and makes me excited about the future of the MCU.",5
"Dec 30, 2019",Phenomenal film 10/10. That is how you do a team-up movie. I love the chemistry with all the characters. it was slow at first to build up the team up but it was amazing. The action scenes are epic. Very fun to watch.,5

I love how they connected all the Characters together for a big showdown
I really liked the Music in this one
Its Filled with Action
And its a must see for Sure",4
"Dec 19, 2019","The film that launched the MCU into the stratosphere. With fantastic balancing and equal story beats for previously built open well rounded characters.
This spectacle is tightly balanced with moments of levity intwined with awesome battle sequences. Amazing performances and a perfectly balanced story made this film revolutionary.",4.5
"Dec 18, 2019","In my opinion after their friend and ally is murdered by the villian, heroes simply do not go on to deliver extendeddddd playful beat em up scenes for the big baddie and his army of nerdowells who are in the midst of committing genocide.   It is not how storytelling works unless you're going for that Deadpoolesc style take.  

This film was essentially just close ups of every hero as they crack the lamest! one liners since Batman and Robin and smirk into the camera.  Between these close ups we are treated to slapstick comedy faceplants or bro on bro punches between the ""rage filled"" monster companion(the most embarrassing take on the hulk to date) and the god of thunder...... lame.

For the finale the alien army is just straight up insta killed in a single explosion for some reason.  The director/writers never bother to explain how this is even possible or to show the heroes working out a way it could be achieved, in fact they had no idea themselves.  There is no established link between the aliens and some sort of hive mind or central control hub or entity who is connected to them all delivering commands.  No just stark grabs a missle the government shot at New York(despite the portal being in the sky above it) and happens to fly it through the portal and it, by sheer luck, manages to hit a ship we haven't even seen before and BAM!!! planetary scale invasion immediately ended.   Coolcoolcoolcoolcool lets hope no one questions it.  I guess who needs narrative when thor can faceplant a window right xD


Next the mass murderer who stabbed their mate to death in the previous scene is comically interrupted mid temper tantrum(after all his entire motivations for being a villian in the first place is a temper tantrum with his adopted daddy who gave him a better life than he could ever of had otherwise) by the funny ""rage monster"" who leaves him in a ditch and cracks a lame one liner as he strolls off screen""pwunnnwy gwd"" :/.   The camera then zooms in for a close up of the big baddie who in turn, comically sighs with a bemused expression on his face and the heroes grab a quick bite to eat in a nearby half destroyed restaurant.......   if this wasn't the most angsty/edgy villian i have ever seen i dont know what is.


The franchise completely lacks the understanding of how to balance comedy with tragedy and shows no sign of improvement as it continues.  Storytelling takes a back seat to flashy action scenes and poorly timed one liners.  Romance and/or family relationships are barely more than an afterthought, if they are mentioned at all.   It all cumulates in a lack luster movie with 0 emotional developments or story points, disappointing narrative plot holes and an anticlimactic finale.  The characters have to be the most gimmicky collection of 2 dimensional heroes on the big screen in decades.  If it wasn't for their hammer or robot suit or fancy shield you wouldn't be able to tell one character from the other.

Overrated doesn't cut it for this movie how it crossed a billion dollars is, i don't know, the lamest miracle ever? hah",0.5

"Dec 10, 2019",I appreciate how they made sure to introduce each character before bringing them together for an epic fight to defend the Earth. It gives much more depth to each superhero.,5
"Dec 10, 2019",Marvel really outdid themselves on this one. This is one of their greatest works to date and only a handful of films can compare to this one - and all of them have mostly been Marvel too!,5

"Nov 25, 2019",Stan Lee cameos are the best! It's too bad he won't be around to do that now. It was one of the things I look forward to in each of the Marvel movies,4.5
"Nov 25, 2019",The best thing about this movie is that it gave each superhero their own unique way of contributing to the team. It wasn't just another film wherein there's one superhero that stands out among the rest while the rest got overshadowed by this main character.,5
"Nov 25, 2019","More than just a superhero film, this movie had a definite soul and smart plot as well. It's a guarantee that superhero fans will love it but at the same time, common moviegoers will find it entertaining too.",5

"Oct 22, 2019","The Avengers had changed the way that superhero ensemble films are made, with a great script from Joss Whedon including his famous quips and also his direction, he knew how he wanted to make the characters stand out. Of course the stand out performance is Robert Downey Jr. (as he is in all MCU films) the only main issue I have with this film is that is does start of slow, which might turn people away, however if your stick with it towards the end, then you get a epic 3rd act, which  at the time was the greatest on screen. So with it being full of action, humour, great superhero set pieces, the Avenegrs is a must see for all superhero fans... you will be converted when you see the greatest group shot along with the music still remains the best ever..... One of the best superhero films ever made off course.",5

"Oct 8, 2019",After years of solo hero movies we finally have the avengers come together to defeat lokey. Amazing to finally see all of our heroes teaming up. And see the direction the MCU is heading in (infinity gauntlet). All in all a great movie with great action. And decent CGI.,4
"Oct 8, 2019","Everyone is saying that and game is the better movie but it's like not even that good.  I mean it's a good sequel but not a good movie. There so many reasons why end game is not good. 1st of all why didn't  Tony just use the eather or reality stone to just cut all the chitari and thanos in half  and why don't they just use the time stone to go back before black widow died and just save her.  But with this movie it's  pure and everything is important they didn't and they couldn't add nothing could of been cut out. Also Robert Downey Jr. Is way better in this movie than he isn't endgame. Loki is also a really good villain he all like shakespearean and of like he talks in metaphors. Like  when Nick fury is like trying to steal the  tesseract and he and Loki have a conversation and when Loki says, "" I will make a world free"" then Nick says, "" free from what?""  ""free of freedom, freedom is the one lie we tell ourselves and once we accept that then you will truly be free."" that I the Nick's like,""We have no quarrel with your people"" he says an ant has no quarrel with a boot,""  "" do you plan on stepping on us?"" And the part where iron man thor and captain America are fighting is just so cool and Thor strikes cap's sheild and the forest basiclly explodes, just go watch the scene it's amazing. Snd also watch the movie.",5
"Oct 7, 2019","This film definitely lives up to the hype. The writing shows improvement since previous Marvel Studios films, making the dialogue purposeful and the one-liners are actually funny and not overly cheesy. The choreography in the fight scenes is perfect, with characters using moves that are unique to them and their powers. The CGI and visual effects are incredible, speaking of which, the Hulk's character model is improved as well, making him more realistic looking and actually resembling Mark Ruffalo, who is a welcomed actor replacement as the character of Bruce Banner. Thor and Captain America seem to fit better as side characters in this film, and the interactions between them and Iron Man are full of chemistry. Robert Downey Jr. is on point as usual. Black Widow's character is improved, with Scarlett Johansson showing some emotional depth. Tom Hiddleston shines as Loki, delivering a theatrical performance that comes off cunning and sinister. This film raised the bar for what Marvel Studios is capable of.",4.5
"Oct 7, 2019",Excellently done movie,5

"Aug 4, 2019",a flawless film from start to finish. bringing all these super heroes together in one movie made for a truly epic action packed story that had me at the edge of my seat the entire time. the acting is flawless and the characters are all memorable and captivating in there own way. the film is smart funny and full of heart and action. its a visual masterpiece and one of the best films inside the marvel universe.,4.5

"Aug 2, 2019","This is a film that really shouldn't have worked, but it oh-so did. It is just so much fun with amazing performances, notably RDJ (obviously) and Tom Hiddleston, who knocks it out of the park as Loki. Marvel did the impossible. 9/10.",4.5

"Jul 13, 2019","Such a memorable and impactfull moment for not just the mcu, but all movies in general.",4
"Jul 11, 2019","THE AVENGERS is spectacular in several senses of the word. It is literally a spectacle, with people flying up into the sky, monsters plummeting out of it, airships flying through it and so on. However, the real dynamism here is in the character interactions, not something one expects of even a regular superhero movie, let alone one where a bunch of different storylines have to intersect meaningfully.

Followers of Marvel Comics characters in the movies have already seen Robert Downey Jr. star in two IRON MAN films, Chris Evans as CAPTAIN AMERICA and Chris Hemsworth as THOR, the alien mistaken by the ancient Vikings as a god. Although Mark Ruffalo is new to the role, there have been two previous HULK movies in the last decade. (There have also been SPIDER-MAN, FANTASTIC FOUR and X-MEN movies, but those don't come into play here.) Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson and the essential Samuel L. Jackson as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury have all turned up in one or more of the aforementioned features, so THE AVENGERS comes into frame lugging a trainload of back story.

However, THE AVENGERS hits the ground running, more or less literally, and finds deft ways to bring us up to speed on the various histories should we have missed or forgotten anything, without boring those who know. Director/writer Joss Whedon, working from a screen story co-crafted with Zak Penn, finds enormous amounts of fun in putting together people who are accustomed to being viewed as odd with new folks they can't help finding even odder.

The short version of the set-up here is that something is stolen from S.H.I.E.L.D. and Fury reaches out to his operatives – some less enthusiastic than others – when it turns out that the Earth is imperiled by the object itself, the entity who has stolen it and the allies he summons.

We know that ultimately all of the main characters are going to figure out how to work together to save the planet – they are, after all, super heroes, not super-shirkers – but see how they variously overcome their differences or revel in their similarities is much of the fun. Most films in this genre – the X-MEN series being the notable exception – have to focus on one awesome figure and make every other good guy a bit less awesome in comparison. AVENGERS can't, shouldn't and doesn't do that. Here, everyone has a tactical function, but more, each one of the Avengers fills the screen in a way that none of the others can.

Whedon directs the action kinetically and makes sure to give each character's unique abilities a proper showcase without having to slow down to underscore that's what he's doing. There does seem to be a particular sense of joy when it comes to the Hulk, as well as some glorious physical stunt work by Johansson's Black Widow and Cobie Smulders' Agent Maria Hill.

We get the sense that Downey's Stark is first among equals here, perhaps because, of the main characters, he not only has the biggest arc, but is the most mercurial. His philosophical clashes with Evans' straight-arrow Steve Rogers (aka Captain America) are wonderful to watch because of their differences, but even more memorable are his scenes of surprised affinity with Ruffalo's Bruce Banner/Hulk. There's something genuinely affecting in seeing these two men, used to being misunderstood or not understood at all, finding kindred spirits in the midst of thundering havoc all around.

A note of special appreciation about the Hulk here – not only does Ruffalo give us a man who is in a state of minor exasperation at all times (the better to defuse his rage) and major self-imposed loneliness, but the visual effects department gives us the best iteration of the Hulk since Lou Ferrigno went green. We can still see Ruffalo's performance within the Hulk, rather than having CGI trying to impose a version of an actor's face on something that looks like a badly-proportioned videogame avatar (which has been the case with at least one previous iteration of the Hulk).

Hemsworth remains a delight as the slightly befuddled but utterly game Thor and Tom Hiddleston is elegantly wounded as Thor's spiteful stepbrother Loki. (One caveat – Loki's horned helmet doesn't look any less silly than it did in THOR. This bit of costume design does not survive translation to live action well, but Hiddleston bears up under it nobly.) Johansson is coolly capable (and of course looks fantastic) as Natasha Romanov/Black Widow and Renner targets some emotional moments with understated precision. The entire cast is terrific.

The 3D doesn't distract from the film, although it seems unnecessary – the effects all look like they are satisfyingly dimensional enough without the extra process and it would have been nice to see the kind of colors those dark glasses inevitably tamp down.

In summation, THE AVENGERS will appeal to fans of comic books, fans of action and fans of characterization and dialogue. It's a pretty awesome assembly.

By the way, sit through the closing credits. Just sayin'.",4.5
"Jul 10, 2019","This film is one of the greatest crossovers in cinema history, the action is amazing, the characters are likable and all have great chemistry and the story is clever and well written. This movie will certainly be remembered for many things. 10/10!",5
"Jul 8, 2019","Some. Assembly. Required. Avengers Initiative! The Big Superhero Team Up! Four Lead actors, two previous Cameo appearances, formed by Nick Fury, and Shield Agents Phil Coulson, and Maria Hill.  Avengers is a celebration of the Superhero Movie Genre Past, present, and future. A dreamful, imaginative, innovative fulfillment of what a franchise, or modern serial could become. Officiating the term ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"" , picking up from the end of Thor, with diverse backgrounds/abilities  of the core team, to Battle Loki and the Other's Chitauri. 
Best Superhero Team Movie of the time, arguably any. The spectacle made up for the weakest points of what you previously invested in for lower tier MCU films.",5
"Jul 8, 2019","With 6 superheroes introduced on the big screen, they finally come together in this non-stop action packed adventure!",5
"Jul 7, 2019",Somehow marvel was able to do the impossible. giving screen time to all its major actors to pull of well rounded movie that is tightly shot and unbelievable performances by all.,4.5
"Jul 7, 2019",marvels first really big movie still amazing i absolutely love this masterpiece,5
"Jul 7, 2019","A combined Avenger film directed and written by Joss Whedon has a lot of expectations, and it lives up to every one. Whedon brings his classic humour and humanising to the dysfunctional family of Avengers. It's such fun to watch them clash but inevitably come together. Epic visual effects continually upping the game in the Marvel universe. Also has some great Easter eggs.",4
"Jul 7, 2019",A great payoff that guarantees a fun time.,5
"Jul 6, 2019","Looking back at this now, it isn't the perfect movie I always made it out to be.  The humor is fine, but cuts into some of the more serious stuff (though not as bad as Ultron did), but even so it still brings together these heroes perfectly.  You get great scenes for each Avenger and it pushes them to the limits as a team.  It's not the perfect movie, but it was the start of something greater.  It kicked off the rest of the MCU and set up the rest of their team up movies to come.",4
"Jul 5, 2019","I couldn't stop laughing I theaters, this movie is just to good",5
"Jul 3, 2019","What can I say? This movie is pretty great. It was the birth-movie of the Avengers, and it brought them together beautifully, in a way no movie had ever done before. The differing personalities of every hero, as well as their similarities, were shown excellently, and the tensions among them were developed well. Then, the final act did all of the characters justice. I've never been a fan of action, honestly, but it was pretty cool to see the newly found Avengers kick ass.",4.5
"Jul 2, 2019",A film with lots of superheroes and action,3
"Jun 25, 2019",The superhero team up you won't shut up about.,5
"Jun 22, 2019","This is one of my favorite movies. It manages to give us well-rounded characters, quippy dialogue, and awesome action scenes. Five stars",5
"Jun 22, 2019",What a great start to my favourite part of the MCU universe. I'll give Marvels The Avengers an A,4.5
"Jun 17, 2019","Worst avengers film of them all, felt like it ended in the middle of the film.",2.5
"Jun 15, 2019","The movie is really good, but I'm disappointed in that fact that the government send an atom rocket to kill all people who were still there. Now my trust level to the government is really low, they are violent people.",5
"Jun 12, 2019",So generic and predictable.,2.5
"Jun 7, 2019",The best thing about the movie is the characters in it. With the amazing character development including one of the best villains Loki and fueled with mighty action it was one of the grand entry in the superhero genre.,5
"Jun 4, 2019","The plot is great, the action is fantastic, the bad guy is interesting. The movie is just great.",5
"Jun 4, 2019","One of the best classic superhero movies.
Avengers Assemble!",5
"Jun 3, 2019","One of the best marvel movies and arguably the best of the series, Avengers finds away to set egos aside and let these hero's fight amongst one another and save earth from a great villain",5
"Jun 3, 2019",This movie was really good this action packed movie was amazing but the combo attacks were even more awesome to watch tom was outstanding in the role of loki,4.5

"May 29, 2019","This movie is one of my favourite mcu movies.
This movie its awesome.",5
"May 28, 2019",Loved it! This is the movie that sparked my love of the MCU and I've been watching every movie since. All the actors were great but I particularly loved Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow. She is a bad a**!,5
"May 25, 2019","This is a great movie that is a great way to start off with the original six avengers and also, Nick Fury is a vital role in this movie and you get to see the struggles that the Avengers face that will come back to haunt them in Captain America: Civil War. Also there is an important scene in Avengers:Endgame that you must see this movie to understand.",4.5
"May 22, 2019","The team is finally together. 

I will admit that going into this film I wasn't sure that Loki was the correct choice for an antagonist, but he astoundingly does an amazing job! I mean, he was the bad guy in the first Thor and for him to be the carry-over villain in The Avengers seemed like it would be stale, but he does a fantastic job. I will admit that I felt like the crew sort of come together with a little more ease than I thought they would. I'm not sure that the death of someone would have been enough to have them all come together in this way, but clearly, I'm wrong...because that's exactly what happened.

A fantastic movie will definitely watch again!",5
"May 20, 2019","The movie is AVENGERS. The genre is aventure and action, the actors act good. It's an intense film.
  There are 6 people: Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow and Arrow. The rating is 12. It has a little suspense. The sinopsis is very nice.",5
"May 20, 2019","Yeah, heroes! The story is shaping the world to their needs and we're in for a lot of action.",4
"May 14, 2019","The very first MCU movie I ever saw nd it is great. This is one of the best MCU film for me, the villain is one of the best.   
It has some problems, but it is great",4.5
"May 11, 2019",This movie was amazing. had the right balance between comedy and action.,5
"May 11, 2019","From the beginning it's amazing, showing an interesting plot in a pretty epic way. If you come following the previous films of the MCU you will love how they bring together several things. But in any case they present you with each character with well-written dialogues with which you can perfectly understand who they are and their motivations, without becoming over-expressive or boring.
There is a very good development of the team, which when they have problems that are arranged in a very natural way. The final battle is very good, and seeing the heroes meet for the first time is epic",4
"May 10, 2019","Apasionante, alucinantemente guionizada, tremendos efectos. La mejor de la franquicia, sin lugar a dudas. Inolvidable.",5
"May 9, 2019","A geek's dream come true. Full of amazing action and great interactions from out favourite heroes. 

Loki, while questioned by many, is one of the best villians of the MCU... and definitely a good addition to this movie (although sometimes they play down his character for the sake of jokes a little too much).",4.5
"May 9, 2019","not the biggest fan of the MCU, but for me, this is the best film I have seen from them. Undeniably entertaining adn amusing.",4.5
"May 4, 2019","Despite some questionable green screen around the last 3rd of the movie, The Avengers is still pretty fun. It really was a risk trying to make this movie happen, and it really payed off.

I still preferred The Dark Knight Rises and The Amazing Spider-Man when it comes to superhero movies of 2012, but I still really enjoyed this film.",4
"May 3, 2019","My favorite scene in the avengers movie is hulk knocking Loki down, before he said puny god.",5
"May 2, 2019",Good opening to the Avengers movies.,3.5
"May 2, 2019","With all of Marvel's most iconic heroes on screen at the same time, wonderful performances, excellent soundtrack, intense, immersive and fantastic action, spot-on humor, visually appealing status and total direction control by Joss Whedon, Marvel's first teamup movie centering around the awesome Avengers, this movie remains one of the highest grossing films of all time, as well as one of the finest films ever crafted.",4
"May 2, 2019","Filme muito bom, um dos melhores da Marvel.",5
"May 2, 2019",Expected much better. Never thought I'd say this (except maybe first two Thor movies) but wish I could get my money back.,2
"Apr 29, 2019","Cool movie, but it's more like an Iron Man 3 than an Avengers film...",3
"Apr 28, 2019","This movie is one of the greatest things in the MCU to this day. I think that the assembling of the team in the first bit is a little slow, but it is completely worth it for the third act. This third act is one of, if not the best, to date. I think Loki is an extremely great villain who someone we can understand their motives. I think that the casting of Mark Ruffalo is interesting, because it makes the Hulk less serious, but at least he still Hulks out in the battle. This is one of the best movies in the entire MCU and I think every movie fan should watch this.
9.5/10",5
"Apr 28, 2019","Avengers Endgame was a terrific ending to a beautiful a 11 years 22 movies saga. The final battle was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen, it felt just like a comic book.",5
"Apr 28, 2019",Thank you for making all my babies in one movie and it IS THAT GOOD. Thank you.,5
"Apr 27, 2019",This is one of the greatest superhero movies ever. It combines a great cast of characters that get a long very well. The actors also played their roles perfectly and the plot of this movie is great.,5
"Apr 26, 2019","The culmination of multiple solo movies and tie-ins, “The Avengers” showcases great actors in relatable roles discussing real world problems and human emotion, and at the same time is a story about superheroes fighting giant aliens.",4.5
"Apr 26, 2019","Without the memory of the MCU and Infinity War, End Game might be remembered as a great science fiction epic. With the last decade of films in mind, End Game suffers for clinging to plots that already defined previous MCU films and delivering duds for some of the biggest cliffhangers at the end of Infinity War. To be fair, the film had its share of novelties and character developments, but a certain lack of creativity plagued the second half of the film.",3
"Apr 26, 2019","BANG! POW! SPLAT! BOOM!  the brink of disaster. Spanning the globe,  hyperbole much?",1.5
"Apr 26, 2019","I remember not studying for my World History AP test in high school and failing it as a result to go see this movie, but it was well worth it, because 'The Avengers' is still one of the most satisfying payoffs to anything, ever. Somehow, every character gets their due with whip-smart dialogue and fantastic action that culminates into a phenomenal third act of pure superhero spectacle. You really couldn't ask for more.",5
"Apr 26, 2019",the movie was good but the hulk that is used in the movie with ed norton is much better looking then this one,4
"Apr 26, 2019","This movie is what got me into Marvel movies. It's hilarious, action packed and just a really fun time!!",5
"Apr 25, 2019","The epic start of one of the greatest eras of film in modern history. i will always be thankful to everyone involved in the ""Infinity Saga"" for keeping me here 11 years and not only providing life to these characters ive grown to adore, but give me laughter and heartbreak and determination with a quick binge. i saw this film in theaters twice and fully enjoyed. i hope to the same for Endgame.",5
"Apr 24, 2019",3rd best marvel movie next to infinity war and endgame,5
"Apr 24, 2019","If you forget about some of the cheesy themes and insensible plot, The Avengers is a solid team-up movie that combines past superheroes, creating an event that has raised the bar for superhero films.",4
"Apr 21, 2019","Fun, entertaining, exciting, interesting and extraordinary is what makes The Avengers the solidification of the MCU",5
"Apr 21, 2019",The Marvel movie was fantastic it had awesome battles and a awesome story. All the characters from the previous movies formed a team to stop Thor''s brother Loki. Loki is a cool guy. Awesome!,5
"Apr 19, 2019",Memorable first assemble of everyone's favourite Marvel superheroes is powered by enthralling set-pieces but drags a little in the third act.,3
"Apr 17, 2019",I don’t have words to describe how good this movie was and the way they set it up to be a 21 son 22 movie franchise was incredible,5
"Apr 16, 2019","Excellent movie, but I'm afraid Loki was just not good villain for it.",5
"Apr 14, 2019","Um... holy crap. This is a fantastic movie. It lived up to double what everyone was hoping for, or at least I thought everyone was hoping for it to be good. I guess I was wrong though, because some people didn't like it, and the only way you possibly couldn't like this movie is if you didn't care or didn't want to be good in the first place.",5
"Apr 13, 2019","One of the most iconic movies ever made. The amount of times I've re-watched this marvel of a movie is uncountable. However the only thing that restricts it from the five star rating for me is the amount of corny, out of place jokes along with the over-exaggeration of the unique quirks of our core characters (e.g. Tony's sarcasm, Thor's Shakespeareanesque and Cap's 1940's attitude).",4
"Apr 9, 2019",Joss Whedon brought all of our favorite superheroes together beautifully in this fantastic film!,5
"Apr 9, 2019","Joss Whedon strikes the door hard and what's visible is Kevin Feige's dream team.

The Avengers

Whedon is much better a writer than he is a director. On a scale of McQuarrie, disappointingly Joss Whedon, the director, wouldn't even qualify as one. For when it comes to map the ever longed battles by the fans, he takes things lightly a lot. Whatever glory that bedazzles you on the screen, is a pure feat of bravery on paper not on screen. Too much cheese and too much sweet, his self-earned jaw dropping moments, are spoiled by him by the bitter afterbirth of his fandom. Fortunately, these battles are here as the starters, the main course is the ""build-up"" to that battle.

Whether then you watch gleefully these characters argue egotistically or see a train of awe-gasping moves by them to overpower each other on screen. There lies a profound poetry between these moments where you can see 8 year old Whedon playing with his toys in his room, creating banal engaging scenarios between Captain and Tony. This crowd pleasing franchise saw the maybe-expected uplift from this chapter, as it managed to bring out every adored content, from humor to drama to juicy visual effects. The dollars were written in the script and so it was visible on screen.

Among all the triumphs of Whedon, his biggest is combining these behemoth figures and weave out a compelling conversation that is worth ten times any battle shown. Downey is the singular actor that comes out with a sigh, his performance isn't interfered by the intertwining of multiple plots, which it seems like it did to others. If aligned the priorities of the makers, the characteristics of the characters that evolves into an essential element in the storytelling, is their way in, for this safe formula wasn't inscrutable enough to convince us that these guys, The Avengers, can avenge.",3.5
"Apr 7, 2019",Probably the best film ever made,5
"Apr 5, 2019",What a blast! Everyone was talking about it for weeks.,5
"Apr 3, 2019",Now THESE are the heroes we needed. I'll take the Avengers over the Justice League any day of the week.,5
"Apr 2, 2019","A basic superhero plot is welcomed, and while it is understandably clunky in some parts, it's more than helped by the terrific cast and satisfactory action.",3.5
"Mar 29, 2019",A little goofy and meh til the end but the alien army seems it could have been taken out by our military elites...so why do we need superheroes. Not bad but boring at times as it took awhile to see the characters truly work together.,3
"Mar 26, 2019","Almost two and a half hours of Iron Man ""Batman-ing"" his way through everyone around him trying to figure out things- oh, and Loki is apparently a big enough threat to bring the strongest forces on the government's super hero contact list together on an airplane-like china shop just so the Hulk can ""Hulk"".

Overall, Marvel's The Avengers is a great addition to the MCU with a bunch of fantastic one liner's from a crew that if all else fails, will at least ""avenge"".",3.5
"Mar 25, 2019",Very Good Movie Loved it,4
"Mar 24, 2019","Marvel’s The Avengers proves you can have blockbuster smash hit of multiple heroes on the big screen, With defining character moments, action packed plot, and a well rounded cast .",5

"Mar 19, 2019","Loookii , oh plus his bro , plus the Capt. plus Tony ,plus everybody including the arrow (?) Yeah I'm not sure he is too strong , more like an optional avenger but who's combing the back of flies , he did his part good too. Loved it , utterly utterly irresistible",5
"Mar 18, 2019","This movie was really something when I watched it seven years ago, and plus I really loved the action. First of all, some of scenes at the beginning were a bit dramatic, but it then gets to the good parts after that. So the Cinema is mostly normal, but there are some parts in it where its CG, and that's what really gets me going. As for the directing, I have to say that Joss Wheldon did a pretty good job at the acting, and the actors did very well too. Finally, lets just say the overall saying of this movie is that it is pretty sad, because one character dies in one scene, and in the end, it is mostly action scenes and I liked that part.",5
"Mar 15, 2019",Trama buona. I parametri di giudizio sono tutti soddisfatti. La colonna sonora di A. Silvestri è buona ma non ottima. Bel film! Voto: 8,3.5

"Mar 10, 2019","This movie really brought the Marvel franchise to the forefront of pop culture. When my generation becomes old, we will always remember this film. This movie had good acting, great action sequences, and impressive CGI for its time. Props to Joss Whedon for being able to bring all of these talented actors together brilliantly for a wonderful film. Timeless classic!",5
"Mar 10, 2019",2018 October i watch this movie first and boy i like it. Reason why i wanna see this because everyone hyped Infity War so i do not have no choise.,4
"Mar 10, 2019",Amazing combination of an established universe combining all characters together for the first time. Does feel that some of the hero vs hero fight scenes are forced for the film however.,5

"Mar 10, 2019",This movie is awesome,4.5
"Mar 9, 2019","So exciting, ambitious, and bombastic that its myriad flaws are hard to see at first glance, the Avengers still stands as a strong kick-off point for the series, and a cinematic game changer for blockbuster films at large.",3
"Mar 9, 2019","the start of the enterprise...the only thing is why haven't we had a movie about Hawkeye & Black Widow yet? The storyline is silly, and the villains, droves of aliens, just don't convince me the Avengers are that mighty nor fearsome....",2.5

"Mar 9, 2019",Hell yes!  Great fun movie. Every single character has their role and is given the limelight at some point. The Hulk going nuts in New York was probably one of the most exhilarating scenes in a movie in recent history.  This movie was worthy of multiple viewings for sure!,4.5
"Mar 9, 2019","This movie is almost perfect. Extremely entertaining and left a deep impression for me. When I entered the cinema to watch this show, I was just expecting 2 hours+ of fighting and 'fireworks'. I was so wrong about it. The characters are so well potrayed and given a good balance of screen time. Beautiful masterpiece.",4.5

"Mar 9, 2019","Though not all of phase one was perfect, ( I'm looking at you, Hulk ), This movie makes up for it. I'd say 95 was a better critical rating, but 92 seems deserving. The marvel cinematic universe stays true to the books, while being easy to follow.",5
"Mar 9, 2019",Amazing....  Absolutely fantastic,4.5
"Mar 8, 2019","I remember the trepidation of going to see Marvelâ(TM)s The Avengers. Could they really pull a team-up like this off? Could the whole really be a sum of some awesome parts? I wasnâ(TM)t sure. That trepidation turned into utter lack of interest. X-Men: The Last Stand left a bad taste in my mouth, but the Avengers crew was regaining my interest in the superhero world movie by movie. Good thing I gave the movie a chance because I ended up having the time of my life.

In Marvelâ(TM)s The Avengers, Earthâ(TM)s mightiest heroes take on the evil Loki who is hell-bent on world domination.

Acting: 10

Beginning: 7

Characters: 10
The gangâ(TM)s all here and what a gang. I appreciate that each of these superheroes are battling their own inner demons which affects how their characters interact with the other heroes. itâ(TM)s what makes them a good team. They come to understand each otherâ(TM)s dysfunctions and deal with it. This is the first movie where you start to see the team use their strengths in tandem and work together as a team. Their initial lack of chemistry is hilarious to watch as they are forced into a unit.

Cinematography/Visuals: 10

Conflict: 9

Genre: 10
Bringing all these characters on the big screen at once was a monumental accomplishment. It was a risk that paid off. A damn good movie was made here and deserves a ton of credit for setting a standard in the way superhero movies should be done.

Memorability: 8

Pace: 8

Plot: 10
The story weaves together the backstories of the other characters in seamless fashion. While there arenâ(TM)t many twists and turns to throw you off or keep you guessing, I would also argue that twists werenâ(TM)t necessary for a film like this. Tell the story you need to tell and if we can see some awesome superpowered battles along the way, great! Job well done here.

Resolution: 10
Solid ending capped off with some fun end-credit scenes that pave the way for films to come. The entire movie is meant to entertain and I was happy that they finished strong. Itâ(TM)s a capper that leaves you wanting to see these guys team up again.

Overall: 92
Seven years later and the Marvel Cinematic Universe is still going as strong as ever. Iâ(TM)m going to see Captain Marvel tomorrow, a film that wouldnâ(TM)t even be possible without the success of The Avengers and other lesser-known properties like Guardians of the Galaxy. Seven years later and this movie still never ceases to excite me and make me laugh at the same time.",4.5

"Jan 24, 2019","The movie as whole is not bad but at the end of the day, it's pretty much the generic superhero/comic book movie - lots of explosions with some semi-funny one-liners. The action sequences were nothing outstanding (they were actually less impressive than the first scenes in Thor). On top of that, the movie is a bit slow until the half-way point. Some characters felt out of place like Scarlett Johansson's character and that Phil dude. Hulk's reason for being on the team was very blurry as well. Overall, an entertaining popcorn flick watched with boxxy software app but nothing more.",2.5

"Jan 12, 2019","Never has so much money been spent to make a movie look so cheap.

Clearly the entire budget went on the CGI in the last act, because most of the first half of the movie looks like a TV series. Seriously. Look at how some of the shots are constructed. This is TV studio level direction.

Credit to Marvel for having the direction and commitment to bringing the MCU into existence and linking everything together into a payoff, but unless you have a massive investment in the characters this is not really anything special, with a by the numbers plot involving massive egos learning to get over their individual dick sizes and work together to defeat a common threat. Plus explosions.

I actually got bored and needed two sittings to actually finish watching this.

Avengers, is an awesome movie uniting the great avengers of the comics,the movie works, the villain is incredible, although sometimes it decays and makes it tedious, but then we have a few minutes of pure confrontations of the Avengers Iron Man, Thor Black Widow Captain America fighting in New York. Then when the hulk arrives and if they all join, it is a work of art and even better the villain is very acceptable and his needs are noted and why he is fighting ... 10/10",5

"Nov 27, 2018","Joss Whedon has brought us the movie that comic book geeks have been waiting for. Marvel's The Avengers. Robert Downey Jr. plays Iron Man, Chris Evans plays Captain America, Chris Hemsworth plays The Mighty Thor, Scarlett Johansson plays Black Widow, Jeremy Renner plays Hawkeye, Mark Ruffalo plays The Incredible Hulk, Tom Hiddleston plays the baddie Loki and Samuel L.Jackson plays Nick Fury. The change between Mark Ruffalo and Edward Norton was actually the right choice to make because Mark Ruffalo plays Bruce Banner and lot better than Edward Norton did. This movie was a real game changer because this was the first ever comic book movie when a group of heroes team up which made this film very unique and the best movie that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has produced. 

Loki, the adopted brother of Thor, teams-up with the Chitauri Army and uses the Tesseract's power to travel from Asgard to Midgard to plot the invasion of Earth and become a king. The director of the agency S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury, sets in motion project Avengers, joining Tony Stark a.k.a. the Iron Man; Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America; Bruce Banner, a.k.a. The Hulk; Thor; Natasha Romanoff, a.k.a. Black Widow; and Clint Barton, a.k.a. Hawkeye, to save the world from the powerful Loki and the alien invasion. 

This film have amazing SFX and the entire New York fight scene was CGI and it look so real. This film has an engaging plot which is brilliantly acted and I would highly recommend that you watch it.
Rated PG for mild language and moderate violence

"Nov 26, 2018","Instant classic. I sat down and watched this movie and couldn't take my eyes off it. The actors are all amazing, and the effects are good too. Highly recommend.",4.5
"Nov 24, 2018","A remarkable movie easily fulfilled and then exceeded all expectations. I've been waiting for this movie since Sam Jackson's character uttered those famous words after the first Iron Man film. Out of the 3 of the Avengers films, this one is the best. This film shared flashbacks with past films. Which was fine. Mark Ruffalo made his first appearance playing the hulk as a re-cast and I'm glad to say he's much better than the last actor who played him, Edward Norton. Mark Ruffalo brought more mystery to the Bruce Banner character. All that Norton brand was put a random homeless character on the big screen. I didn't know this, but apparently, all of New York was CGI in the movie. 

It was great and not just the setting. The Hulk was as well. The Hulk scary chase scene was so horrifying. Jeremy Renner character was very creative and we didn't get much of Hawkeye in Thor. All we got is him drawing his bow and that's it. He didn't even shoot. Loki shouldn't of fake death at the end of Thor. Terrible twist. The relationship between Thor and Hulk was hilarious. The S.H.I.E.L.D. aircraft was an incredible visual effect. This will boost the team based comic book movies a lot. Thanks to the film's success.

This film was definitely my favorite out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The aliens were quite interesting - and seeing Captain America fight again was exciting. Robert Downey Jr. was charming in his role. I love this film.",5

"Oct 2, 2018","The Avengers is the first team-up film in the MCU and follows the crew as they argue for a while before teaming up to fight some aliens that are invading Earth thanks to Loki opening up a portal.

Even when I watched The Avengers for the first time back in 2012, I didn't think that the story was all that special. This is a long film, and for most of it we just sit around watching the heroes talk. There are a few action set pieces throughout the film, such as when Thor, Loki, and Iron Man (and Captain America) have a pretty awesome scuffle, but besides that it's a whole lot of chatter and not a whole lot of anything else. And it doesn't help that these conversations aren't particularly interesting. The final battle in the city is cool, but there's nothing particularly jaw-dropping about it either. The story here is just...okay.

I will say that having watched the first Captain America film it was cool to see Steve interact with the son of a man that he considered a friend, and slowly realize that he's a bit of a douche. Steve and Tony's dynamic is by far the most entertaining in the film (and possibly the MCU, which makes sense given the future these two have).

As to be expected by this point with MCU films, the cinematography is great. Of course, this is also the film where we get the iconic shot of The Avengers as they assemble on the battlefield, which was cool to see.

In the end, though, while everything in this film is solid, I don't find it to be particularly mind-blowing. And really a big part of the reason why I don't like to watch this one very often is because of the long run-time. There's nothing in this film that makes me want to sit down for 2.5 hours and watch it, unless I'm doing an MCU marathon.",3.5

"Jul 15, 2018","Marvels The Avengers 2012 was truly a build up of anticipation. After each of our hero's solo outings we see the characters and personalities come together in such a way that feels realistic and grounded, despite the fact that aliens are soon to fall out of the sky. Introduction and motivation to characters drives the movie, but beyond that we see that of course these individuals don't all get along at first. Why would they? The idea of them becoming a team is what pushes the film forward. 
Director Joss Whedon takes he's experience from Buffy, Angel and Firefly and seamlessly builds the narrative with these already interesting characters. The action is nothing short of mind blowing and the CGI is seem less, particularly the work put into the hulk who's never looked better. 
Loki, our villain from the film returns after the events of Thor (2011) is the one we all love to hate. What we as the audience can take away from he's character is that we understand he's motivations through real and understandable emotion. Truly the best villain Marvel had done thus far. 
In conclusion, this movie has something to love for everyone. The pieces really did fall into place perfectly with this film.

"Jun 25, 2018",Definitely my favorite marvel movie ever released . I remember walking out of the theater mid blown. I saw it again later that day. Also it still holds up great and a must buy.,5
"Jun 18, 2018","At the core of a great film is an even greater story. At the core of every great story are even greater characters, chemistry and a strong foundation of source material. The Avengers have been around since the early 60s, and the characters even far beyond that. Personally, in the midst of my parents divorcing, I decided to take a second chance on comic books after dipping my toe into Captain Carrot and his Amazing Zoo Crew in March, 1982 while living in Broken Arrow, OK during one of my many, many trips to QuikTrip to either buy ice cream, donuts or penny candy while playing Ms. Pac-Man. It wasn't a wonder why I became fat around this time. Fast forward 2 years to May, 1984, when I purchased Avengers (Vol 1) number 243, mostly due to my being intrigued with Captain America. I instantly fell in love with comics, and needed them to help me cope with the massive changes going on around me at the time. 

For the next 3-4 years, I was obsessed with comic books, which centered completely around the Avengers, like Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Secret Wars, etc. I read everything I could and became immersed into the years and years of Avengers history. Even as girls and music became more interesting to me than comics, I still always had an affinity for the Avengers. At one point, after beginning to earn a good living about 15 years ago, I tried collecting every issue ever made. I got about 95% there when comics started being graded by CGC and ""guaranteeing"" condition. I then sold most of my mediocre conditioned books and wanted to collect 9.2-10 (Near Mint-Mint) copies of every issue. Only, the expense far outweighed my dedication and, to this day, I only have a few. 

My heart has always been with the Avengers, though. My heart was broken when the first Avengers cartoon series in 1999-2000 was an embarrassment. Just a pathetic series. However, when the X-Men movies did well and other titles like Daredevil, Elektra and Fantastic Four started to be released, I was excited to eventually see, at least, Captain America, Iron Man, etc. on the big screen. Never did I think a studio would be ambitious enough to attempt The Avengers as a whole.

Then came Iron Man...a B character, at best, perfectly cast Robert Downey, Jr. as a spot-on Tony Stark. And it was huge. Then came the news that Marvel had owned the properties again and had a strategy to deliver individual movies leading up to an all-encompassing Avengers movie. NO WAY, I thought. Oh this was BOUND to get screwed up. And, frankly, there was probably NO WAY to please me, a die-hard Avengers fan, on the big screen. Just no way. Especially after Ang Lee's atrocious Hulk movie. Surely Hulk would be left out of the mix. 

Then came Edward Norton as a superb Bruce Banner in the Incredible Hulk movie that hit all the right buttons, continued the Iron Man storyline, eluded to the Super Soldier serum, tying it all together with SHIELD. The final scene in the Incredible Hulk showed us a meditating Bruce Banner with an evil grin, seemingly embracing and enjoying the monster within, which told us die-hard fans that he must be in the control of Loki, Norse god of Mischief, as was the case in the classic Avengers #1 issue from the early 60s. Could they be setting up Loki and the Hulk as the villains of the Avengers movie as a modern interpretation of the old comic book??

Then came Iron Man 2. A poor sequel with a very casual inclusion of more Nick Fury, Black Widow and Avengers talk. Way too rushed, and thus what caused Favreau's exit as director. My interest was still high, but I became cautious as the humor of Iron Man began leaning this whole thing in a direction I had hoped wouldn't come to pass. Then, at the end of Iron Man 2, Thor's hammer in the middle of the desert sparked my interest, as designed, again.

Then came Thor. I was really worried about this one. A Norse god? Among all these high-tech, very human heroes? Given the extremely strong representation of Batman by the Nolan films, this movie had the ability to throw the whole thing into full-blown CAMP. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Introducing Hawkeye helped a lot as well. Then, at the end, with Loki seeing through the eyes of Erik gave us fans another glimpse of Loki controlling humans, which sparked the interest of the Hulk again. 

Finally, Captain America, perfectly cast Chris Evans and developed a near-perfect story around the Red Skull and the Cosmic Cube. The foundation was almost full strength and The Avengers movie was on the horizon. Could it meet the expectations of the film fans? Better yet, could it meet the immensely critical expectations of the decades of comic book fans?

Over the past few months, I've seen some of the most uninteresting trailers for The Avengers. I have been so worried thinking that the movie I've waited 28 years for was going to be an absolute disaster. Trailer after trailer, it didn't look any better. Did Joss royally screw this thing up???

Well, I saw it opening night, tonight. The trailers show the tiniest fraction of what happens in this absolute masterpiece. Sure, it's action-packed. It's expected to be. Sure it's got funny moments. It's expected to, especially with Robert Downey, Jr. as a leading man. What Joss Whedon did was take the greatest care of characters since Nolan's Batman series. The interaction between the characters, the way they deal with their own personal concerns and flaws, and how they come together as a team is so perfectly executed it nearly brought tears to my eyes. 

To most people it might be looked at as an enjoyable popcorn film; a great kickoff to the summer movie season. To me, a die-hard, multi-decade fanatic of this comic, these films, these characters and the integrity of keeping them authentic was paramount and, honestly, impossible to achieve, in my eyes. Joss proved me oh-so-wrong. When I began seeing the very nigh praise, the 93% on Rottentomatoes, etc. my low expectations became super high expectations. How often are expectations like that ever met? Well, I can at least say they weren't met. They were left in the dust, exceeded beyond anything my fanboy mind could have conjured. Bless Marvel, Whedon and these actors for treating multiple generations of fans to a perfect example of how it can be done right. Sure, Nolan has become the gold standard, but Whedon showed everyone that Marvel can do it too. 

My only regret is that Edward Norton couldn't reprise his role as Bruce Banner. Of the 3 Bruce's, he was the best. Mark Ruffalo was the worst. I like him as an actor and he had some of the mannerisms, but Edward captured the intellectual, frightened and loner aspect of Bruce Banner perfectly. Hulk, however, stole the show. Without spoiling some of the key aspects of the movie, I will just say that Joss' inclusion of Hulk in the manner in which he was was the cherry on top of this perfect sundae. 

While I can't imagine them topping this one, I've been so strongly surprised, I would never say never. The setup at the end of The Avengers has me so excited about where these movies will continue to go. I even guessed the surprise ending way early in the movie, but that was a product of my pure geekiness made happy by clearly other geeky people who wrote the film. Bring it on, Marvel. Excelsior! Nuff Said!!",5

The action is top notch and you might get a bit woozy even with all the stuff that happens on the screen. This is a movie event and it should not be missed under any circumstances (must watch superhero extravaganza).",4
"May 21, 2018","Surprisingly lithe for all its heavyweights and the enormity of its universe and narrative scope. The jokes are just clever enough without becoming themselves overwhelming, the action remains in service of the story, and the plot keeps things relatively simple. Perhaps not as good as you remember, but better still than you might expect.

REWATCH: Placed in the context of the overall Marvel arc, with the first phase of films still fresh in the memory, the movie, though still formulaic, feels somehow more spontaneous and full of life---once again, explicitly even, what matters is not the overwhelming spectacle of different superpowers, but the common humanity of these characters joining forces, discovering who they can become and what they can overcome when put together.",4
"May 17, 2018","Definitivamente Marvel's The Avengers quedará en la historia como la película que hizo que la montaña Marvel creciera en cuestión de segundos. Inició todo un boom, hizo que varios sean fans de los cómics-si es que ya no lo eran desde Iron Man 1- y definitivamente por ser el primer megacrossover de franquicias superheroicias y el excelente trabajo de Josh Whedon, siempre tendrá un lugar en los corazones de cada cinéfilo. Avengers Assemble!",5
"May 16, 2018",The first Avengers is an excellent composition of characters that essentially launched the ensemble craze we see today.,4.5
"May 16, 2018",Everything built to this..All the movies before this...and this movie justifies it.a great experience.,4
"May 13, 2018",The Avengers combines great action while achieving a great superhero team up film.,4
"May 12, 2018","Following four years' worth of movies building up for this moment, ""The Avengers"" is the big crossover that finishes the first phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, by bringing together some of Earth's mightiest heroes. When the Asgardian prince Loki makes a deal with the leader of the Chituari army to subjugate Earth, S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury has to bring together a group of remarkable people to stop this Alien threat. That includes Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, Black Widow, Thor and Hawkeye all teaming up to save the world, as hard as it might be interacting with each other, due to their different personalities. But this team-up works. The ensemble cast is perfect, especially Robert Downey Jr., which reprises his role as playboy-genius-billionaire Tony Stark. Joss Whedon manages to make everyone in this group of heroes shine. The characters are as complex as it gets, the humor is on point, the action is otherworldly and the most impressive at the time this film came out, the stakes are high and it just delivers on every level, living up to the expectations and the promises its predecessors created in the minds of the fans. All in all, it's pretty much the perfect comic book/superhero movie and the epitome of how all blockbusters should be made, filled with a little bit of everything to make this an unforgettable cinematic experience that will be discussed for decades to come.",5
"May 10, 2018","I just went back and watched the original Avengers film and it is still Excellent!  I forgot a lot of the story and I'm very happy that I watched it again.  It also marks the first appearance of Thanos in the end credits.  Plus, I forgot the Avengers didn't form until the movie and there are some good fights between the heroes.",4.5
"May 9, 2018","OMG MOVIE OF A LIFETIME
SERIOUSLY PEOPLE. This movie has the exact amount of action, character development moments, interesting plot, smooth direction, and pumped up music. The only minor flaw is the technical errors in plot and 2% too much humor at uneccisary moments.",5

"May 1, 2018","As I've said for years, comic-book films struggle once they've told the origin story. This one is good--less of a ******* Batman story, but that's what some are looking for...the deeper more serious tale. Batman for adults, which is fine, but it's not what we're getting from Marvel films. Nolan has knows his ancient westerns civilization with his allusions to ancient Rome. I give it a solid B",3.5

"Apr 27, 2018","DO NOT TAKE CHILDREN TO THIS MOVIE
I grew up with Marvel and have usually enjoyed their movies...unitl now. This movie is DARK and FULL OF DEATH. There is no happy ending and no heroes that come to the rescue.

"Apr 25, 2018",Yeh how can you not love this movie. The one and only thing bad about it was Captain America's outfit and even that looked decent when he wasnt wearing the helmet. The way Weadon made these characters react with one enother was briliant. the action scences were spot on cool and Loki is still the Best MCU villian and he just made this movie awsome. The way the story played out so that the heroes didnt originaly come together as a teem but in end knew that the only way to stop the threat on earth was for the group of reemarcible people to come together. this movie was smassing.,4.5

"Apr 23, 2018",A powerhouse film that brings superheroes to life in a way that could only be imagined in the pages of comic books before it.,4
"Apr 23, 2018","The very first big team up superheroes in a movie like this, and they nailed it, and it still holds up really well 6 years later. The characters have great chemistry and really feel like an actual team, the acting is perfect in every sense of the word, the action is great, and... yeah, theres really not much else I can say. While its almost guaranteed to be surpased by infinity war (which the reason I decided to watch this again is because infinity war is literally right around the corner at the time I'm typing this) its still a great superhero that is absolutely worth watching if you somehow haven't already.",4
"Apr 23, 2018","Strengths: It was always a crazy ambitious plan, but Marvel made the Avengers work in ways nobody could've imagined. Joss Whedon was the perfect person to write and direct this, as he seemed to fully understand what needed to be done. The movie juggles so many vital characters and none ever feel like an afterthought. Robert Downy Jr. (Tony Stark/Iron Man), Chris Evans (Steve Rogers/Captain America), and Chris Hemsworth (Thor) are as great as they always are. Mark Ruffalo (Bruce Banner/Hulk) steps in and provides an upgrade over Edward Norton. Speaking of the Hulk, this was the first movie to truly feel like it understood what the Hulk is supposed to be. He gets to absolutely wreck stuff. Scarlett Johansson (Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow) is honestly kind of a show stealer, while every scene she shares with Jeremy Renner (Clint Barton/Hawkeye) is great. It's the kind of thing that was only put into the MCU during this film, yet worked very well. Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is also a great villain choice, as he and the character have the charisma to line up next to his co-stars. The story has just the right amount of dramatic peaks and valleys. The conflict is not only against Loki and his army, but among the Avengers themselves. Two of the best scenes involve the members arguing on the ship, as well as fighting in the woods. As noted, each character is given ample opportunity to strut their stuff, but the film also makes sure to give the fans what they want. Battles between Cap/Iron Man, Thor/Hulk, Thor's hammer and Cap's shield, etc. were all given attention. The writing is sharp, the dialogue is witty, and there are several laugh out loud moments, making it one of the funniest Marvel films ever. Of course, there's also the action, which is tremendous. There are several huge action sequences that are all perfect for this kind of movie. The final battle against the aliens in New York is grand, breathtaking, and features incredible team ups. 

Weaknesses: I'm sure it sounds weird to say, but I couldn't find any. This is the epitome of what the big blockbuster superhero movie should be. 

Overall: An incredible achievement. They handled so many moving parts with grace and the end result was the greatest superhero movie in history. The action, writing, performances, and way they respected the source material and characters were all done perfectly.",5
"Apr 23, 2018",This is everything that a superhero movie should be. They really struck gold with this one. Then just copied the formula for all the Marvel movies after it.,4.5

"Apr 4, 2018","This was everything we've been waiting to see plus more. Since they rolled out the first Iron Man in 08 they have been building towards this movie this moment and in my opinion it was better then anyone could ever imagine  that it would be, This is the best  comic book movie that is out right now(with the age of Ultron super close to being better).The storyline was great the look of the film can't be touch even though it was most of it was cgi. The action was just outta of hand great.Infinity wars is less then a month away and from the trailer its looks to be good but I will say that the first Avenger set the bar very high.",5

I guess the dull masses don't mind seeing the same tired story again because this time, OMG, it's the Avengers!!

Aliens attack Earth en masse, but are repelled by a group of 6 exclusively white people, 2 of whom don't even have super powers (or a super suit).  LOL.",2.5

Loki is a great villain but I definitely think they should have found a way to make him super powerful cause on his own he can’t beat Thor let alone the avengers, even with a random alien race on his side and a mine controlled scientist who has very little impact on this movie as opposed to the first two Thor movies",4.5

"Feb 21, 2018","An impressive screenplay allows the audience to become completely invested with characters that are given the right amount of time to be developed. However, despite the blisteringly entertaining action and impressive effects, I don't understand why people believe Loki is such a great villain. He's good for sure, but not the best the MCU has to offer. Doesn't change that this film is about as good as the MCU gets.

"Feb 11, 2018","The team up of all the marvel heroes that we have been waiting for. In a move that I didn't think would work actually did. All these characters and egos working together seamlessly. Sure, there are flaws and plot holes, but they still work out to make an enjoyable movie going experience. With the Iron man leading up a team of reluctant heroes in order to save the world from Loki and his band of mindless minions. The three main heroes, Iron man, Captain America, and Thor, all shine through. The real surprise though is Hulk. Mark Ruffalo calls in a memorable performance to bring a smile to any comic book fan. His one liners and erratic behavior makes to an enjoyable performance. The one that is held back by the crowded lineup is Hawkeye. Set to be a mindless drone that does Loki's bidding for a majority of the film. This is a real waste of the talent of Jeremy Renner. The man can act with the best of them and he is assigned to a role that is forgettable. The directing style of Joss Whedon is felt for sure. His mannerisms and comedy is felt throughout this film. It feels like Firefly mixed with Buffy. Whitty dialogue mixed with great action set pieces. A must see.",3.5

"Jan 20, 2018","This was the movie to either make the MCU or destroy it. If this was bad the MCU would be finished but if it was good we would be provided movie after movie. Thankfully it was the latter. This was a great movie. The movies before it were not the best. In fact the only truly great one was Iron Man. The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2 and Thor just kind of failed. Captain America First Avenger was good but not great. The Avengers was even better than Iron Man, thankfully. It seemed that Kevin Feige finally understood not to overstuff the movie. In this movie there are many different superheroes on the screen at a time but it never feels overstuffed with plot like Iron Man 2. Sure everyone is dealing with something but it never makes the main plot feel insignificant. Also, unlike most of the MCU movies before it this movie has a good villain. It brings back Loki. Also this movie is directed by Joss Whedon who previously directed Firefly and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. He did a great job. The plot of the movie is kind of stupid. Basically there is a giant beam in the sky and The Avengers need to stop it but the movie also is filled with great little moments that make it all better. Robert Downey Jr. as  Iron Man is great again. Chris Evans is good. Fortunately Edward Norton as the Hulk was replaced by Mark Ruffalo. The MCU has done a very good job with replacing actors with even better ones. Mark Ruffalo does a great job. Chris Hemsworth is again alright. Tom Hiddleston as Loki is a great villain who is funny but also psychotic. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is a lot better in this movie than in Iron Man 2. Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye actually has more than five lines now, unlike Thor, so I guess he is better but he is still everyone's least favourite Avenger. Samuel L. Jackson is great as Nick Fury. Clark Gregg as Coulson makes for an emotional thrill ride. The whole movie is just amazing. The first act is not great but it gets better very fast. Overall it is a great movie. Thumbs up.",4

"Dec 24, 2017","The 2012 Avengers is probably the best superhero movie ever, with the possible exception of the Dark Knight - really depends on what you want from your superhero movies.  A concept like this shouldn't work, but it does, and is so satisfying.  The interplay between these characters coming together for the first time starts out with them grating against each other, but eventually coming together to work well.  I don't think you could have gotten a better director to pull this behemoth off than Joss Whedon, who is very accustomed to large ensemble casts of very disparate characters.  This was a love letter to the fans, a self-congratulating showcase of an experiment that shouldn't have worked, but worked so well that every other studio is trying to find their own franchise universe, and a flag planted that nerd culture is on top and is planning to stay there for the forseeable future.",5

"Dec 20, 2017",This is the movie that proved that the MCU worked. From beginning to end a magnificent thrill ride that proved the worth of the superhero genre.,5
"Dec 20, 2017","I like this movie just fine, but I LOVE the second half of it with a passion. After the first hour of pretty interesting set-up, this movie takes off and never lets up for a minute, making it incredibly entertaining",4
"Dec 19, 2017","After five stand-alone movies, the Marvel Cinematic Universe finally adjoins to have six World War II, Norse mythology, and modern-era superheroes band together to fight alien-looking monsters with an iconic score blaring in the background. In other words, the first superhero crossover movie is finally here. After many movies behind its back, this movie is set to make five times the money. For too many years now, the concept of them banding together was nonexistent. There is no question why that scene of them standing in a circle, loaded up in the heart of New York, ready to fight for humanity was ever so important. If you are not sure why that is so meaningful to the audience of the movie, you may have not seen the post-credit scenes to every film beforehand (particularly Iron Man and Thor) as Samuel L. Jackson recruits members to his team.

Beforehand, it would have been clear not to anticipate the film. But now we can only thank director Joss Whedon for creating such a fun-filled thriller of a summer blockbuster. Whedon had previously been known for creating TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer and can now claim his right to balance large-scale projects as a coherent piece. Having been trusted by such a project though, he seems to have forgotten the millions of Joker fans counting on him to make this entire film work together and instead saves space for Wizard of Oz, playing cards, and Asgardian family jokes. But the fact this still works makes you only love the film even more.

The amount of millions Hollywood has spent reintroducing these characters in movies may seem unnecessary. It is. Robert Downey Jr.'s character, Iron Man, is basically a billionaire tech-geek who owns an iron suit. Chris Hemsworth's Thor and Chris Evans's Captain America are both super-soldiers from non-modern times who have received the spotlight recently so they don't need stand-alone movies. In fact, the central Avenger who steals the show in this film has actually not been introduced before, at least not with this actor, is Bruce Banner, who has rage issues and turns into a green monster known as the Hulk.

These team members assemble with Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, an agent for Nick Fury, and Hawkeye, an archer for SHIELD portrayed by Jeremy Renner, who just came off of the smashing success of The Hurt Locker, in order to defeat an Asgardian known as Loki, who has come down to invade Earth. Loki is played by Tom Hiddleston and spends much of the movie demanding humans kneel before him without very dark intentions. It is almost a shame that this is the threat the Avengers are facing against.

As this cast and crew are set into action against this script and threat, a MacGuffin-type power cube which tends to always show up in any sci-fi action movie, The Avengers begins to follow its earlier themes and genres: a buddy-cop comedy. The fighting amongst the members of the Avengers in this film actually turns out to be rather refreshing, turning two-dimensional comic book characters into three-dimensional big-screen superheroes. While the script seems to be weak at times, it wins itself back through these conversational exchanges.

It is the action sequences that truly make this film what it was meant to be, while being easy to follow in the process. In a beautiful scene, SHIELD's helicarrier takes off into the air and in a similarly breathtaking action sequence, it gets destroyed by Loki's forces. They then return in the third act as Manhattan gets wrecked to pieces in an effort for the world to be saved.

The battles won seem reminiscent to our fantasies of superheroes saving us from external threats and avenging our world in outstanding action scenes. The film's title certainly displays avenging. While this is probably not the case, the film gives us a breath of fresh air by choosing to go the old-school light way. The nostalgic route the film chooses gives more heart rather than fear and plays well just at that, granting comic book fans their dreams. Even Hulk is granted heart as well as anger. The audience will feel the same way.",4
"Dec 18, 2017","Marvel Studios has managed to do the unthinkable and delivered a kick-ass movie experience. This movie is definitely one of the best works done by Marvel. Full of extraordinary action, well-timed humor, fleshed out characters with differing ideologies, and an actually compelling villain.

"Nov 2, 2017","'Marvels The Avengers' have assembled for people to see
     Based on Marvel Comics The Avengers has finally hit the theatres with great quality and a excellent plot to keep you on the edge of your seat.  The director for this movie is Joss Whedon with actors Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark), Chris Evans (Steve Rogers), Mark Ruffalo (Bruce Banner), and many other actors.  
     Messing with a source, of unlimited power: the tesseract, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) brings forth Thor's evil bother Loki (Tom Hiddleston).  Now stealing the tesseract, he threatens to bring war and destruction unlike the world has ever seen.  With no choice, Fury calls upon a group of heroes to stop Loki for completing his plan and save the world from mass destruction. 
     What really drew me into watching this film was the drama that went with this plot also the action that made me wonder what would happen next.  Them bringing to life the comic that we loved so much to the main screen made me want to see if it would be like the comics we grew up reading or just garbage that people made to boost their rating.  As the movie began, I was already put into suspense with its beginning dialog and partial clips of an army getting ready for war.  Trying to bring together a group of superpowered individuals that have never met each other and never worked together can cause turmoil between them and start a fight between them.   
     I think the actors really played their parts well, with some slide remarks and being serious when the time came. Being able to become emotional if something happened and made it look like that they really cared; not fake tears that you know they are faking it and don't care.  I really felt their struggle through the movie that they had to go through trying to work together as a team and being able to save the world from Loki. It made me feel like that if one of those characters died, I would have become sad because I felt connected to them and I would have felt their pain. The special effects in this movie were very excellent with the designs of the helicarrier and with the effects of every power that everyone had.  Even though that they were effects, the actors played though all the stunts and made it look like all the special effects were there and apart of them in any case that they needed to.  I feel that even if I didn't know the story beforehand or didn't read the comics, the story itself was a thriller in my eyes and pulled me in regardless if I didn't know anything about it. 
     The movie I think was way beyond its time and made a huge excess in all aspects of it. I would recommend this movie to anyone that asked me. It gave me a thrill of excitement with the action and drama all in one movie. It made me never want to look away for a second because of being afraid of missing out on something. Therefore, I think that the movie The Avengers have assembled for everyone to see and to be excited for.",5
"Oct 31, 2017","Joss Whedon had the unenviable task of finishing up Pahse One of the MCU, brining all the heroes from previous instalments into one movie and deliver an entertaining superhero movie at the same time. And he pulled it off flawlessly.",5
"Oct 29, 2017",The Avengers: Marvel Skillfully builds from thier preveious predeccesor's to an action packed hollywood piece. One that keeps the idenity from their characters and is full of storytelling.,4
"Oct 24, 2017","The Avengers. A maniacal Marvel ensemble pinata party. Skip the obvious fun-ness of a solid lineup of charismatic heroes of well-made solo franchises, this is a good flick and not a great movie. I hate harping on ""believe-ability"" especially pertaining to sci-fi movies but there are massive, blazing plausibility issues within this story. Is a meager squadron of slow, un-stealthy, poorly armed aliens flying chariots through a single 100 ft. bottleneck over NYC, which is located in the United States, the largest and most dangerous arsenal in the world really an existential threat to the World Security Council, SHIELD, The Avengers, planet Earth? Thanos & Loki must have been high when they cooked up this plan. The Avengers were equally misguided in showing up for this fight considering the whole problem could've been solved by a single surface-to-air guided missile battery. Especially when the enemy can apparently be put down with punches, arrows and pistol caliber rounds. It wouldn't take Stonewall Jackson to stop this silly raid.",3

"Sep 25, 2017","Lots of great action and acting, but the story had a lot of illogic.  Kept driving me crazy.",2.5
"Sep 16, 2017","Even as a nearly lifelong comic book fan, when Marvel Studios first announced that they would be producing an Avengers film, I was skeptical on how it would turn out. Granted, they had just scored a hit with the wonderful first Iron Man film. However, since superhero movies until that point had mainly focused on a single character, how would Marvel flesh out six different heroes within one film? Flash-forward nearly four years later, and Marvel and Joss Whedon managed to construct not only one of my favorite installments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but also one of my top theater-going experiences of all time. I cannot add anything new to all of the praise that has been given to the performances of the leads, as they each give it their all. However, I would like to single out Mark Ruffalo in his first go-around as Dr. Bruce Banner. Though Edward Norton gave a capable performance in 2008's The Incredible Hulk, he wasn't necessarily overly memorable, in my opinion. Here though, Ruffalo truly conveys the pains and struggles experienced by Banner in his coming-to-grips with being the Hulk. Another positive that somewhat flies under the radar in this effects-driven film is its action scenes. Despite such a fantastical concept, the action appears believable and is tons of fun to just watch. It was the best action in the MCU to date, having only been rivaled by 2016's Captain America: Civil War in my book. The only weakness here is the invading Chitauri army that arrives in the film's third act, as they are largely an uncharacterized/faceless opposition. However, they utilization as an almost endless and unbeatable threat forgives this, as they help illustrate the residence of our heroes. All-in-all, The Avengers not to be missed by any fan, as it was the culmination of what the MCU was becoming and the springboard for everything else that was to come.",4.5
"Sep 11, 2017","For what it is, it is perfect.",5
"Sep 10, 2017",MARVEL AT THERE BLOODY BEST!!!!!!!,4.5
"Sep 8, 2017","Audiences and critics loved that the Avengers are all white.  Thank God there are no minorities in the Avengers.  All sarcasm aside, this was such a mediocre movie -- a bunch of good guys get together to fight the bad guys and save the world.  Never seen that before.  Predictably, the good guys don't get along at first but they eventually come together to defend Earth from some seriously bland and generic aliens who aren't intimidating at all.
 
Coulson's death was supposed to be a pivotal moment in the film, but absolutely no one cared about him so that just totally fell flat.

Tom Hiddleston gave a very limp-wristed performance as Loki.  Apparently he reasoned that Loki sounds like ""low-key"" so why not play the character that way?

The action sequences were all lackluster.  Like all the other PG-13 comic book movies, the fights are all sanitized of blood, gore and anything that would be too violent.  Therefore, the fight scenes all suck.  But hey, at least the Avengers are all white, am I right?",2
"Sep 7, 2017",To this day I still enjoy watching this movie. All of the heroes have good pieces for each of them.,4.5
"Sep 6, 2017","I'll give ""The Avengers"" an A+, a 10/10, five stars ... evertthing. I'm not a Marvel fanboy. I like Marvel very much, much more than DC, but there's just something about this incredible franchise and universe. Joss Whedon knew what he was doing. ""The Avengers"" might be the best Marvel movie ever, at least from the Walt Disney era. I mean, couldn't we get better than this? This movie shows us how a blockbuster should be, how a super-hero movie should be done. The action and the CGI are fundamental, of course, but while we have these amazing characters, dialogues, music choices and conflicts, we'll be satisfied.",5
"Sep 5, 2017","""The Avengers"" is one example of how to make a perfect crossover movie, not too. All references and easter eggs were merged into this film. They are tied up every connection, interconnection, even the little detail, they show it and display it into one movie. Each of the shot, the visual effect, and the performance are quite brilliant except the script that doesn't kick too much. ""The Avengers"" is like an orgasm of each of the nerdiness. Everyone who watched this film, both Marvel's loyal fans, the comic books fans, the moviegoers, or even those who watched it from ""Iron Man"" would experience an orgasm of a nerd. What a great job by Joss Whedon.",4.5
"Sep 2, 2017","Marvel finally Mad a movie with all of the Avengers where they meet each other they must face Loki that would be Thor""s brother now it's time for Captain to give orders to the Avengers if they want to win! See this movie remember they made avengers 2",4
"Aug 30, 2017",I thought Avengers was a good one. The action and adventure is good. It is a good one in the Avengers Franchise.,5
"Aug 28, 2017",Most likely the greatest superhero movie of all time.,5
"Aug 15, 2017","Despite arriving at a very early start for the MCU, ""The Avengers"" mark a point and separate for the modern era of cinema. The effects, performances and the excitement of seeing the most important heroes of Marvel make us enjoy more than 2 hours of footage as if to read a comic is about.",4.5

"Aug 8, 2017","Standard formulaic superhero movie. It delivered on it's promise for action, comic relief and heroics.",3

"Aug 6, 2017",The action was great even though there was some down time.  Long but didn't seem too long,4
"Aug 5, 2017","Do you know the saying, know your audience??
Joss Weadon really gave the fans everything they've ever wanted in the first marvel team up.",4.5
"Aug 2, 2017","First off, where the heck did Loki come from? I really enjoyed the opening title music. I like the scene where they recruit Captain America to the Avengers. I liked how they cut from hero to hero in the recruiting process in the beginning, giving us a glimpse at what each hero was up to during their ""break"". I like how cap stays old fashioned. Captain America and Iron Man coming together and meeting for the first time was classic and really foreshadowed at Civil War. The writers did a good job showing how they have to have altercations before they come together and they finally come together after a well needed push (Phil Coulson's death). One of the best scenes in the history of movies is the revolving scene around the Avengers as they come together before war. Also I really enjoyed when it cut seamlessly from Avenger to Avenger each fighting their individual battles in the war. Great ending to the end of MCU phase 1. I love Marvel because it combines the world we all know with that of a fictional universe to aid our imaginations in creating fantasies about a combination of these universes where anything is possible.

In the mid-credits scene the Other speaks to his master (undoubtedly Thanos) about the failed attack on earth.
In the end credit scene the Avenger are eating shawarma.

Stan Lee makes his appearance in a short news interviews saying ""Superheroes in New York? Give me a break""

"Jul 20, 2017",The Avengers is the movie that all the Marvel movies have been leading up to and it lives up to the hype. I would give it a 9.3 because there is almost nothing wrong with it. Only a couple of minor details is there to complain about. Each of the characters are done so well and the story is just as interesting. If you have been living up to the hype in the past movies you have to see this movie.,4.5

"May 31, 2017","This film definitely lives up to the hype. The writing shows improvement since previous Marvel Studios films, making the dialogue purposeful and the one-liners are actually funny and not overly cheesy. The choreography in the fight scenes is perfect, with characters using moves that are unique to them and their powers. The CGI and visual effects are incredible, speaking of which, the Hulk's character model is improved as well, making him more realistic looking and actually resembling Mark Ruffalo, who is a welcomed actor replacement as the character of Bruce Banner. Thor and Captain America seem to fit better as side characters in this film, and the interactions between them and Iron Man are full of chemistry. Robert Downey Jr. is on point as usual. Black Widow's character is improved, with Scarlett Johansson showing some emotional depth. Tom Hiddleston shines as Loki, delivering a theatrical performance that comes off cunning and sinister. This film raised the bar for what Marvel Studios is capable of.",4.5
"May 31, 2017","In The Avengers, Marvel pulls off what no-one thought they could: They assembled the Avengers on the big screen. All five movies lead-up movies culminate in this ground-breaking film that actually works on nearly every level, and leaves you wanting more.",4.5

"May 24, 2017","The Avengers is an amazing movie that has almost everything. It has action, good acting, good cinematography, and good wit. Overall, it is a definite recommendation of mine.",5
"May 23, 2017","'The Avengers' was directed by Joss Whedon and stars Roberty Downey Jr, Chris Evans and Tom Hiddlesticks(Hiddleston if it actually bothers you). It's the end result of 5 previous movies, combined into one awesome spectacular entry to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. When a charming, likable British villain tries to attack Earth with his giant disposable CGI space army forcing some mentor like figure to form a super team, consisting of the protagonists from 5 completely separate movies rolled into one. And thus we have a Cinematic Universe. Thanks Feige. Your brilliance had doomed us all.

The Avengers is one of the most likable, enjoyable, fun action/superhero movies that's ever been released and redefined a genre. Without this movie, all the cinematic universes we have today wouldn't exist(the debate on whether that's good or not is still open) and a superhero movie on this scale would have been attempted. Don't watch this movie expecting 'The Dark Knight' or 'X-Men' because this movie centres fun as its #1 goal and excels at it. All the cast is likable, the action is fun and it is overall just a great, big fun way to spend 2 hours of you life.

As much as I praise this movie, it does have some flaws. The main flaw is the dull, generic and cliché ridden story which is just really poorly written. It follows the tropes way too closely and began the trend to have NO stakes in Marvel movies. I will also say the 'ending' should have had more of an impact and felt more important than it was so I would definitely say it should have been handled better. The end credits sequences are gold, though.

Robert Downey Jr is excellent as Iron Man and is easily the best part of the MCU. On the flip side of this, I will say that I was very disappointed in Chris Evan's Captain America and I think his blatant lack of emotion and all times is unsettling and boring to watch. I understand the need of a straight man to keep the group in check but he was more like a robot than a human. Hiddlesticks was phenomenal as Loki and remains as easily the best MCU villain. He's smart, he's charming and, most importantly, he's British. That must be a requirement on entry to the 'Super villain Squad' because every villain in the universe is British(or at least the good ones are). Scarlett Johanson was good as Black Widow and you can see genuine emotion between her and Hawkeye. She may not be a critical member of the team but she's a female and yay for diversity. Mark Ruffallo was great as Bruce Banner and I adore how he refers to his alter ego as 'the other guy'. Jeremy Renner was fine as Hawkeye and remains the most useful Avenger with his SICK Archery Skills. Seriously though, he doesn't need to exist. Chris Hemsworth was good as Thor but not particularly memorable. Samuel Jackson is great as Nick Fury and a 15 rated movie of him would be comedy gold.

The cinematography for this movie is great and I adore the tracking shots Whedon uses in the action and I think it benefits the action so much. Whedon CAN do action supremely well. The effects are amazing and are a delight to look at. The costume design was great and the set design was also really good.

This movie needed to provide some fun action sequences, be funny and bring one of the most iconic superhero teams to the big screen without getting crucified by die hard Marvel fans. I can speak for two of them factors and say it achieved them. As for the third one, I can't comment but I will assume they were happy.

In conclusion, this is undoubtedly one of the best comic book movies of all time and is just great fun to watch. If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend you do because it is pure, adrenaline filled enjoyment.

The cast (most notably Johansson, Hiddleston, and newcomer Mark Ruffalo) are the highlights of this film, and are accompanied by great humour and entertaining action sequences.

The characters all feel like they get their own part of the film and not over-shadowed by the others. Some genuine laugh out loud moments and good relationships established between these characters. Maybe this was the time when a big swirling thing in the sky was a good way to end a movie but this has now become a bit stale.,4

It's already a stretch to live in one superhero world, mixing them make it so preposterous. It's like drinking wine and milk at the same time and that is for two.

"Feb 21, 2017","A vast cheesy pizza, very loud, very long, making little sense, and with some very earnest and stiff acting. If only writer-director Joss Whedon had been less indulgent the whole thing would have been twice as much fun. Having said which, it's fine and exactly what any teenager would expect.",3.5
"Feb 20, 2017",Best Marvel movie ever seen,5
"Feb 14, 2017","Fun, Lighthearted, Creative, Well-thought, and overall a great superhero film. They have been setting up for this since 2008 with the release of Iron Man and the final product of the set up turns out to be a great film. This is going to be a classic in the near future. Great example that you can make a comic-book accurate movie with great storytelling and designs.",4.5
"Feb 3, 2017","Me arrependo, um pouco.",5
"Feb 3, 2017","One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It's one of those movies where you don't have to know a lot about the character's history to understand the movie. The actors do a good job with the characters, especially Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk. With its gripping plot and talented cast, the first Avengers movie definitely set the tone for MCU",5
"Feb 1, 2017","Superb acting, costume design, sets, etc... Unfortunately for me, my eyes could not stay open.",2
"Jan 28, 2017","Fun, hilarious and action filled film paced to perfection and story that has you engaged from beginning to end",5
"Jan 25, 2017",Very enjoyable. The avengers are not my favorite but this was awesome.,4
"Jan 23, 2017",a little too corny for me. too many lame jokes but solid movie.,3
"Jan 18, 2017","This movie just doesn't hold up to repeat viewing. Lot of noisy action, a few jokes that work the first time, a character death that is later reversed, and worst of all, a silly argument that somehow leaves the high tech SHIELD base undefended. The three stars is for the fun of the first viewing.",3
"Jan 7, 2017",This is a great movie! It has a great storyline and great action scenes! Loved it!,5
"Jan 6, 2017",Easily one of the best superhero movies of all time.,4.5
"Jan 1, 2017","Did The Avengers Deliver? Yes, but it also gave us a fun ramped up experience with much to love about these character portrayals who we have seen(Mark Ruffalo as Hulk is the only changed choice who is still great). Tom Hiddleston delivers his signature move as Loki, the action is guys tossing each other(in a good way), and we also got funny moments. The plot holes may have sometimes bothered me,but not TOTALLY! We still haven't gotten to my favorite MCU Movie(can you guess?), but this is possibly #3 or #4.I hope you love this blockbuster!",4
"Dec 30, 2016","Fantastico, una sceneggiatura stupenda degli effetti speciali e un cast perfetto, finalmente un Hulk degno del nome",5
"Dec 21, 2016",So amazing! I'm not huge on super hero films but I really enjoyed this. Also hulk is the best,4.5
"Dec 15, 2016",Avengers is a cinematic block busters experince  aggregating all the previous marvel movies and turning it into a massive grandious movie making both fans of the movies and comic book content with the source material,4
"Dec 14, 2016",The first assemble of the Avengers is groundbreaking but has it's faults.,4
"Dec 7, 2016",amazing that joss got this to work and it rocks lol,5
"Dec 4, 2016","Fun, but let's be honest, it doesn't make much sense and it offers little else beyond good action.",3.5
"Dec 2, 2016","the avengers was my favorite superhero movie at the time it came out but at that time, I haven't seen the dark knight. the film was new at the time but  now that we've gotten the same thing over and over again, it's not a masterpiece anymore. the actually battle at the end is great but the rest of the buildup is boring and takes way too long to set up each character instead having the audience watch the previous marvel films instead of being an asshole to the fans.


Owens grade: B-",3
"Nov 30, 2016","Entertaining, a total crowd-pleaser, and everybody is clearly having a good time; but the whole affair is directed like a television show, and Whedon's ideas can never overcome the framework the studio has placed the story in.",3.5
"Nov 30, 2016","Still my favorite Marvel movie! The action, plot, acting, and set pieces are just magnificent and well-done!! Highly recommend if you haven't seen it yet!!",5
"Nov 23, 2016",One of the best superhero movies.,5
"Nov 22, 2016",i h8 how batmman is not here :(,1
"Nov 12, 2016",I suppose when you're juggling so many good guys the bad guys become an after-thought? Outside of Loki this was very much cannon-fodder bad guys again but the balance between the Avengers was so well done you almost don't notice.,4.5
"Nov 12, 2016","What an incredible movie. An AMAZING cast, who all give great performances, wonderful special effects, a good score, and a truly amazing story, The Avengers set the bar for super hero films, while doing something never really done before: a multi character crossover--that worked. Bringing together 5 films of mythos, this movie accomplished the impossible, bringing the heroes from each film together and making them work in an action packed, suspenseful, terrific film.",5
"Nov 7, 2016","Iron Man is humorous, Captain America is cool, the Hulk is awe-some and this movie is my favorite superhero movie!",5
"Nov 4, 2016",Awesome best movie of the year. Must see this.,4.5
"Oct 29, 2016",Marvels best movie ever,4
"Oct 28, 2016","A movie that we thought we be impossible to make, Whedon makes every comic book fan's dreams come true as he brilliantly portrays Earth's mightiest heroes on the big screen. Bravo Mr. Whedon.",5

"Oct 10, 2016",One of the best comic book screen adaptations ever. There really much else to say.,4.5
"Oct 10, 2016",One of the greatest films of all time,5
"Oct 9, 2016",one of the best super hero movies ever,5
"Oct 5, 2016","This movie is great. It's funny, it's action packed, and when it needs to be serious, it handles being serious very well.",4.5
"Sep 26, 2016","The Avengers is so amazing, it's everything I wanted it to be and more. avengers is a really great movie, this is the best marvel movie, the avengers is a masterpiece, the story/writing/directing/script are great, the characters/acting and dialogue are great, the action is amazing, the visual effects are amazing, the soundtrack is great, it's just perfect, this is the best summer movie, it's so fun, but there are problems, the first 5 minutes aren't that good, but we're alright, the action scene saved it, and the last problem with the movie is that it's not the movie that you could rewatch, but it works fine. But besides that, the movie is great, it's very entertaining, very fun and everyone who has seen the movie loves it even I love it.",4.5
"Sep 24, 2016","The pay-off after years of waiting for Iron Man, Cap, Thor, Hulk, Widow, and Hawkeye to join forces. If you didn't like it, the 5 seconds of hulk smash puny god makes this a unique movie, that no other character, or director could have pulled off. Highly enjoyable.",4.5
"Sep 21, 2016",Fun and action-packed.,5
"Sep 17, 2016","This movie was not only great on first watching, but it keeps bringing me back to view my favorite clips and sections. The characterization is what really drives the movie. Yes, the CGI work is very good and the musical score is excellent. But it's the little details that make the characters feel real and involved that bring you along for the ride. One of my favorite tiny moments is the ""I don't...I don't see how that's a party"" line from Black Widow. In that one line, we're given a brief reminder that this is a very skilled human used to fighting very skilled human spies, who's now fighting aliens and monsters of epic proportions without the benefit of the near invulnerability of the super-powered individuals around her. Other brief favorites: the moped. ""Hulk...Smash!"" ""Puny god"" "" I'm pretty sure He doesn't dress like that."" So many great moments that tie things together.",5
"Sep 8, 2016","As a big Marvel fan, this will probably be a bit biased, but I absolutely loved this movie. This was the movie that really got me into the Marvel franchise, with its great special effects and even greater performances from some of the best thespians in the business. The fact that it was also the first multi-superhero movie was the cherry on the cake for me. I also appreciated the humor scattered throughout that lightened the mood just enough.",5
"Sep 8, 2016",How nostalgic can it get.,4
"Sep 5, 2016","The movie event of our generation has some flaws, but is some of the most fun you'll have at the movies",4
"Sep 4, 2016","The ultimate comic book movie. Better than Dark Knight in my eyes. It was funny, the villain is great, and it's the definition of fun.",5
"Sep 4, 2016","Tested the limits of how many superheros can be in one film without combusting, and it passed with flying colors.",4.5
"Sep 3, 2016","The Avengers is considerably overrated when it is claimed as the ""greatest superhero movie ever!"" It's praised for being smartly thought out and having verve and precision with it's execution, but in reality, it's not all that clever or even that great it is asserted to be. The Avengers is a key example of ""style over substance."" It possesses idealistic action sequence that are stunning to behold, but it's overall writing interpretation -- which is the most important aspect -- feels wooden and dull. However, it created a pleasurable experience for me at the movie theater as it's level of enjoyability was at the peak of the mountain.",3.5
"Aug 31, 2016","I think the ratings should be higher than 92%, but that's my opinion. You have to remember that this movie came out with so much hype and it definitely delivered in my book. Not quite 5 stars but 4.5 stars is about right.",4.5
"Aug 28, 2016","Tracking Shot. Everyone who worked on this movie needs a T-shirt that says ""I piss excellence.""",5
"Aug 27, 2016","Not what I was expecting at all! I honestly wasn’t expecting such immense troubles forming the Avengers, but after they were formed, after overcoming their differences, they were simply E P I C. The ending fight/action scene was amazing, and I enjoyed it very much! The powerful team that they formed was terrific, and the way they demolished the opposition and style of writing, and witty humour made this film worthwhile to watch. After all, this was a very anticipated film when it came out 7 years ago in 2012. :)",5
"Aug 26, 2016",Really good with they had hulk from 2008,4.5
"Aug 21, 2016","Visually dazzling, action-packed and even packed with humour to lighten the mood a little, The Avengers is not only an amazing conclusion to Phase One of the MCU but it is also one of the best Marvel films to date with 140 minutes of entertainment and fun in the highest-grossing film of 2012.",5
"Aug 17, 2016","Spectacular special effects to go along with an amazing cast. The Avengers delivers on essentially every level to provide an engaging story with likable, distinguishable characters.",4.5
"Aug 13, 2016","Marvel's The Avengers will be forever known for raising the bar of superhero films to unprecedented levels, it's also one of the most fun times you'll have watching a movie.",5
"Aug 10, 2016","Tom Hiddleston and Robert Downey Jr. simply carry this movie that do not have much to hold it down, the special effects are flawless, the script is ingenious and the performances fit the whole perfectly.",4
"Aug 10, 2016","The generic wipe-out ending for the 'Chitauri' perhaps should of had the technological/biological space-headquarters merely render there weapons and gadgets useless, rather than the default death they received.",5
"Aug 8, 2016","There may never be another film moment like the Avenger's together defending New York City, and it's wrapped inside an intricate story with complexity and heart.",5
"Aug 8, 2016","An epic,marvellous,humorous,meaningful,spectacular movie.. This is the movie we deserve..This is the best in the MCU and bringing out the Avengers together was done in an outstanding way.",5
"Aug 7, 2016","If you like 'Iron Man', you'll like this movie. If you like 'Thor' you'll like this movie. If you like 'Hulk' you will like this movie. Overall... you will love this film.",4.5
"Aug 7, 2016",One of the best superhero films to date with great chemistry between the casts. Worth a watch for any superhero fan.,4.5
"Aug 6, 2016",Muy buen comienzo para unir a los superhéroes.,5
"Aug 5, 2016",Not as good as the critics said.  But a good action movie.  4 stars.,4
"Aug 4, 2016",Superhero team movie done right. Whedon makes even the most fantastical conversation sound real and natural and weaves it organically into an action blockbuster.,5
"Aug 4, 2016",Best movie of all time,5
"Aug 3, 2016",Overrated. First half is dragging and boring. Some action scenes are recycled from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Superman Returns. Marvel's 2nd choice actress Scarlett as Black Widow is pathetic. She lacks the athetlicism and physique to pull off Black Widow. Marvel should've made it work with Emily Blunt.,0.5
"Aug 3, 2016","Cookie cutter story. Recycled themes and characters from previous Marvel films. Weak new characters. Annoying old characters. All with a climatic fight against generic, forgettable alien robots. Do yourself a favor and never see this waste of film.",1
"Aug 3, 2016","Marvel's The Avengers is that one ""awesome"" superhero movie that gives a lot of action and storytelling to characters that have been building up for the past 5 movies.",5
"Aug 2, 2016","one of the best superhero movie's I've ever seen, sure it might be ever so slightly dated at this point, but the reason its so iconic is because it revolutionized Hollywood for better or worse, the avengers and films like the dark knight segmented their place in comic book movie history.",4.5
"Jul 31, 2016",I liked it a lot. There was lots of awesome action and comedy,5
"Jul 26, 2016",This movie brings the most famous Avengers of the Marvel Comics to on screen which lives up to the hype of the movie with great performances by the actors and good action scenes.,4
"Jul 25, 2016",Avengers is an unbelievable action film!,5
"Jul 25, 2016",Avengers Assemble! This is an instant classic and it sure does deliver,5
"Jul 24, 2016",Forgettable but enjoyable.,3.5
"Jul 17, 2016",Not bad at all there Hollywood,3.5
"Jul 14, 2016",Fantastically fun way to launch the superhero ensemble idea. I loved the way starks ego centric nature just runs away with it as the others find their ground around him. Best thing in the whole thing is Loki ofcourse. Still Marvels best vilian; such a fun character and hiddleston clearly is having a ball. Set the bar and showed if you approach it right. A multi character super hero film can work,4
"Jul 10, 2016","The Avengers is a fun action packed movie with great characters and a good story. All of the heroes must come together to fight off the destruction of Earth. Loki is a great villain again. Despite the fact this film must find a way to balance so many larger than life characters, it still manages to be a great film.",4.5
"Jul 10, 2016","With the MCU becoming more and more seasoned with it's films, I feel that none of it can compare to the very zenith of the franchise: The Avengers. This film was a masterpiece of action that saw one of the all-time great movie villains, impressive set pieces, tied  together by the worthwhile themes conveyed on fascism and what it means to be a true hero.",5
"Jul 10, 2016",A decent enough film to hold the attention and entertain. Much more enjoyable having seen the preceding marvel films.,4
"Jul 6, 2016",Best superhero movie ever!,5
"Jul 3, 2016",The best movie ever!,5
"Jul 1, 2016",Marvel's The Avengers is action-packed and entertaining. Marvel brings all the greatest superheroes together to fight in one great battle. This movie couldn't be more perfect. I would very much suggest this movie.,5
"Jun 30, 2016",An enjoyable film you won't want to miss.,4
"Jun 28, 2016","The humor from superheroes with super egos bantering and jostling for attention was the most entertaining parts. Giant mechanical dinosaurs wriggling through a giant hole in the sky provided targets for the superheroes display of fire power and muscle. Team work is good but in the end, only ironman must take the prize to save the day.",5
"Jun 25, 2016",I was left expecting more from an ensemble cast of characters that mostly had their own movies.  I mean shouldn't they have had ample time to practice and prepare?  The pacing was also a little janky.,3.5
"Jun 23, 2016",Redefined modern cinema in such a great way. Amazing movie. Nothing more can be said.,5
"Jun 23, 2016","""The Avengers"" is basically everything you'd want it to be. Dazzling special effects, supercharged action, delicious dialogues, an excellent sense of humour that borders on witty self-parody and, at the heart of all this, a bunch of individually interesting superheroes who, despite their personality clashes, eventually manage to pull off some tremendously glorious team work. Whedon and co. go for it from the first second up until the last and set a prime example for grand superhero flicks.",3.5
"Jun 22, 2016",Mis-matched abilities.,2
"Jun 20, 2016",One of the best avengers movie better than age of ultron,5
"Jun 12, 2016","This  movie is what you'd think it'd be like, awesome and kick ass. The movie is filled to the brim with action, clever humor, and one liners that, in the end, each play beautifully of eachother. The only problem I have with the movie, however, is it's plot isn't really the best nor memorable, but it's way overshadowed by everything else in this movie that, thankfully, makes it one hell of a ride that you can watch ovar and over and over again.",4.5
"Jun 11, 2016",big battles lots of hero's enough said,5
"Jun 9, 2016","Possibly the very definition of a comic book movie, The Avengers is a fantastic culmination of five movies that pays off in every way. Probably the best decision they made in this movie was to recast Edward Norton as Hulk. Ruffalo blows him out of the water and then some as the green giant.",4.5
"Jun 8, 2016","My 3rd favorite MCU movie, this cast....effects....it's so much to handle! This movie got MCU on the the map!",5
"Jun 7, 2016",Good story; liked when the Avengers formed!,3.5
"Jun 7, 2016","The third-best MCU movie, The Avengers is a wonderful culmination of five movies that all pays off. We got seriously lucky that this film was as good as it was. When I first saw this in theaters, my immediate thought was ""Let's see that again."" It's only gotten better with each viewing.",4.5
"Jun 6, 2016",I love this movie! but black widow could have been better!,4.5
"Jun 5, 2016","MARVEL STUDIOS... I LOVE U! BEST MOVIE STUDIO IN HOLLYWOOD!! If people didn't LOVE this, something is wrong with them!! THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME!!",5
"May 28, 2016",This movie is great! The Avengers are assembled!!!!,5
"May 27, 2016","94%     The Avengers is more proof that marvel always delivers, and this movie set a new standard for superhero films. It is as fun to watch as are the characters, and is action packed, at times funny, and united the team of ass-kickers with brilliant results.",5
"May 25, 2016",A film with every chance to fail on every step in bringing Earth's mightest heroes together on screen surprisingly shows nice balance and dinamics.,4
"May 25, 2016","One word: Awesome!! my 2nd best marvel movie. I admit, it is a little overrated. But the positives are stronger than the negatives for this movie. It's Action-Packed, funny, and convincing. It didn't feel overstuffed at all. Definitely worth the wait and hype. I watched it maybe like 4 times now and still ain't bored of it.

Overall score: 9/10 (Amazing).
As a fan of superhero movies, I'd probably rate this a 10/10
but from a filmmaking & casual movie go-er's perspective (Meaning realistic) I'll stick with a 9/10, Highly recommended for everyone to watch.",4.5
"May 24, 2016","Visually it is a marvel (pardon the pun), but it feels generic and flimsy.",2
"May 22, 2016",before civil war came out his was my favorite movie ever it was perfectly done.,5
"May 18, 2016","The Avengers is no doubt the best Avengers movie and is very close to the best Marvel movie and the best comic book movie, has all the elements required for a box office success and a movie to make the mainstream audience happy, the comic book fans and the MCU fans.",5
"May 17, 2016",Perfect in every way!,5
"May 17, 2016","Marvel set up years of crafting The Avengers and building a unique and vastly more dangerous universe than ours. And Joss Whedon helms this behemoth of a film to continually stun and amaze audiences around the globe that something based on comic books can be dealt upon, and you can make modern masterpieces from them. Albeit the film is not perfect, but so are our heroes who actually do care for people and they think and work together to keep the world safe. Once again with solid performances, a deceptively amusing villain, group-sized action against a seemingly unstoppable horde of baddies, and more...The Avengers is pure definition of marvelous.",4
"May 16, 2016",An amazing film that changed comic book films forever,4
"May 14, 2016","Marvelous in every way, Marvel's Avengers will definitely be remembered as one of the (if not THE) greatest superhero movie(s) of all time.",5
"May 14, 2016","Witty and brilliant, The Avengers has been built up by Marvel since the Marvel Cinematic Universe began in 2008, and will continue to amaze viewers for decades to come. This is a movie any comic book fan and average moviegoer needs to see.",5
"May 14, 2016","Finalmente possiamo gustarci quello che tanto aspettavamo, vedere i famigerati Avengers operare tutti insieme in un unico grande film. E' un tripudio di azione ed effetti speciali che riesce a divertire e coinvolgere con estrema facilità. I singoli film precedenti vengono collegati e ricostruiti alla perfezione, con una sceneggiatura intelligente e complessa, con personaggi già noti e quindi ben re-integrati: il modo perfetto per chiudere questa prima fase di film, che ha avuto i suoi alti e bassi. Per ora resta senza dubbio il migliore film della Marvel, che dimostra di essere riuscita nel suo intento di dare vita ad una serie di fumetti così interessanti.",4
"May 12, 2016",It was so cool can't wait for the next movie,5
"May 11, 2016","Finally!! It's here, this film was absolutely everything I wanted, the superhero chemistry was spot on terrific, perfect plot and end to Phase One, the avengers are now assembled, and can't wait for Phase Two!",5
"May 10, 2016","Pat Kiernan, along with many other reporters, discussed the Avengers and the Battle of New York, and how the team had disappeared not long after they had first appeared.",5
"May 9, 2016",it was dumb no real plot except for iorn man having bad days.,0.5
"May 9, 2016","Have you ever felt like solo films like Superman and Batman solo films are getting old, if so Marvel's The Avengers is the movie for you. Director Joss Whedon unlocks the future of Superhero team ups, LIke Batman Vs Superman.",4.5
"May 8, 2016","Fun film, but Loki doesn't make that great of a villain for this super hero squad.",4
"May 8, 2016","There's no arguing that this was the best Marvel movie up until this point - and up until Captain America: Civil War happened. With surprisingly decent acting from the entire cast, it may not be the revolution in Superhero film which was the Dark Knight, but nonetheless tries its best and still produces a very good movie for everyone to enjoy.
Verdict: A",4.5
"May 6, 2016","The Avengers is very exhilarating in action and definitely amazement! From the solo movies of Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, and Thor, the Avengers plays a huge part in the MCU.

"May 5, 2016",I still get goosebumps when it does a circle shot of all the Avengers.,5
