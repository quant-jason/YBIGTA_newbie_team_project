2025-01-10,"The Avengers is the most enjoyable time I've spent with the MCU so far.

It operates with established characters, but they still have character arcs and those are surprisingly very satisfying. Obviously I kind of knew what's going to happen, but that didn't take away a bit from the enjoyment. There were a few moments where I was shocked or didn't know how the story would move forward. The dialogues sometimes feel a little out of place, but are mostly good.

The visual effects have never been this good in the MCU so far, I loved that. I also love the huge cast, although I was sad to see one of my favourite actors, Stellan Skarsgård turned into a villain, alongside Jeremy Renner. The cinematography is great, but the movie is a little too long, so I'm not the biggest fan of the editing. The acting performances are good for a superhero movie.

2024-04-21,"I want to share with you a review of the movie ""The Avengers"", which was released by Marvel in 2012. The film is directed by Joss Whedon. The film's budget is $220,000,000. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgard, Samuel L. Jackson.
The story begins with an experiment on the Tesseract, an ancient relic that is a source of infinite energy at the base of the SHIELD, where Loki, the God of lies and deceit, appears from a portal. He takes possession of the Tesseract and forces Clint Barton and Eric Selvig to also declare war for the subjugation of the Earth. Fury then turns to the most powerful heroes for help, activating the ""Avengers Initiative"" to save the Tesseract and stop the attack planned by Loki. He unites Steve Rogers, Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, the Thunder God Thor, Agent Romanoff and later Hawkeye. Together they must fight Loki's army to protect the Earth.
The acting is excellent, I especially liked the performance of Robert Downey Jr., who played Iron Man. I had the feeling that he was not playing, but living this little life, getting tremendous pleasure from this image. I also liked the music playing in the film, especially AC/DC - Shoot To Thrill.
I really liked the ending, where the true character of Tony Stark is revealed very well.

Marvel proved that it's possible to combine many different heroes together. Ensemble movies where you have to share screen time with many protagonists can be tough within itself, giving each their own character arc, all within a 2 1/2 hour timeframe, yet, they made it work. Granted, having most characters already have at least one movie beforehand to set the groundwork up for their character helps.

2023-03-26,"The world loves it, though I still think the original ""Iron Man"", ""Thor"" and ""Captain America"" were my favorites.

At this point, ""The Avengers"" has made around 100 trillion dollars (or so)--and so it's obvious that people love the film. My own daughter went to the premier in New York and then went to it on opening night in general release--and was mad I didn't take her with me tonight to see it! Obviously, she loved the film as well. As for me, I liked it but didn't quite share the overall exuberance for the film. Mind you, I liked it--but I think I preferred the earlier films before the Avengers team was formed. There was a certain charm that I didn't quite see recaptured in the film. Now the film is good--it's just that what I like in these other films I would have liked more of in ""The Avengers"". Specifically, the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development. When I read the IMDb trivia, it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutes--all showing Steve Rogers (Captain America) trying to adjust to his new life. I would have LOVED seeing all this--and less of the HUGE battle at the end of the film. For me, it just felt numbing after a while and I would have liked more of the characters when they weren't fighting.

2022-12-04,"An All time Classic. The idea of taking multiple heroes from other films and putting them together in this way had been attempted going back to the Universal Monsters of the 30's but they couldn't really figure out how to make it work cohesively. What started 9 decades ago was mastered with this film. The actors all have incredible chemistry, witty dialogue and excellent performances across the board. The cinematography is very good with very well done special effects. Even the end battle which is very heavy with CGI is very clean and well done even though you can tell most of it is computers. The battles between the Avengers themselves are amazing to watch and super intense. The only real downside to this film is the musical score is good but it's not really memorable or catchy like Superman 78' or The Dark Knights, but it's such a small point. The editing and pacing are both fantastic in this. The only serious downside is this is a film that requires you to watch 5 other films before this to understand how good it is. But it is absolutely worth it and even without watching the others you still can tell how good it is. Everyone should give this a try.

2022-09-02,"This is a relatively decent superhero (Marvel) action/adventure film, with plenty of visual effects and numerous fights/battles to keep teens watching, although there is also a fair amount of lengthy dialogue scenes too, in between the more action-based scenes, which may put some off. I don't claim to be especially knowledgeable (i.e. much at all) when it comes to the individual details/background/history of the various characters that come together to become the Avengers (not the 1960s British show starring Diana Rigg, I hasten to add). However, I can't say it's not entertaining in parts - it is and the CGI is fairly good. Perhaps not entirely as realistic as other films but then this is a superhero and perhaps part sci-fi based film, compared to a disaster film or straight drama. 

I did feel that, at times, the script felt a bit too overly cheesy but then I don't suppose I'm the main/intended demographic (a 37-year-old lady).

It's your average run of the mill blockbuster, but a hell of a one at that! Without a doubt this movie's greatest achievement is its all star cast and the chemistry they share, from the charismatic Robert Downey Jr, to the stoic and comedic Samuel L. Jackson, every cast member is perfect in their respective roles and the way they bounce off of each other is just remarkable! The VFX are also outstanding, most of them have aged rather well. This movie does have one glaring problem however, and that is the middle act.

2021-07-19,"The Avengers is a movie that could've easily been a mess and turned out to be a masterpiece thanks to Joss Whedon. The movie nicely culminates the five ones that came before it in the MCU and gives all of the Avengers moments to shine. The action is fantastic, the visuals raise the bar for future MCU films, and the movie ends on a high and satisfying note that leaves plenty of room for future character development and storytelling. The script gives each of the Avengers moments to show us who they are and how they fit into this broader universe. Loki is a great villain for this film due to him being a familiar face and having a direct connection to one of the Avengers, and Tom Hiddleston again gives a strong performance as the character, which is all bolstered by the script giving him a few moments to shine and one-liners as well. The acting in general is good, with both new and familiar faces doing the best they can with their roles. Renner is done a bit dirty in the film, but the big battle redeems that slightly and Renner makes the best of the screen time he has. Unlike some previous MCU movies, this one has lots of rewatch value and will still be entertaining to many on multiple viewings.

2021-05-13,"This movie is not as good as everyone thinks. Sure, it gets better towards the end but the first hour is really boring. It's not just because there is a lack of action because that's not true at all. In fact within the first hour or so there are four fight/action scenes. But the way they are brought about are almost laughable. 

The movie gets good once the hulk transforms on the helicarrier. Scenes aren't lit very well and it almost looks like a episode of firefly. But it's not. It's a huge action blockbuster with a budget in access of 200 million dollars.

You can say whatever you want about Joss Weadon. Whether you love him or hate him I just don't think he's cut out for these kinds of movies.

The characters have fine chemistry but they aren't given enough time to shine either on their own or as a team.

2021-05-07,"This film was really fun. This was a start of something that no one really knew that it was even possible. Just seeing all of these guys teaming up together for the first time. There are some VFX that really hold up and there are some that don't. Any way or another the characters of this movie are just fun to watch and really are good throughout the films Loki was really the most fun Marvel villain that they had until they reached Phase 3 and there were finally some good challengers. This movie was the start of something that really could've not work. But the fact that it does really goes to show how much taking your time and plan things out really help you and could do you really good favors. This was actually the first Marvel movie that I watch, and i'm pretty sure this was everyone else first time too. I don't remember it specifically but I do remember watching it at home when it came out on DVD and I think it caught my interest.

But, before The Avengers, there were five movies, interconnected, it's true, but they were still separate, nonetheless. The average box office gross of those was 460 million (not bad, but nothing compared to present day MCU standards). And crossovers were at most ideas and desires.

The scale of it, the number of superheros, the CGI. I honestly believed this movie was the peak of superhero movies and that nothing will ever beat it. In retrospective, I was of course wrong... Fortunately.

Not only is this movie very good on its own, but the fact that there was a build-up to it from the previous movies that also established our main characters makes it even better.

2020-06-02,"This movie is a masterpiece. This is Marvel fulfilling their vision of a shared universe. Joss Whedon brings all these heroes together in the most satisfying way possible. Whedon is an amazing director, and this movie alone proves it. This was no easy task. Many other studios have tried to copy this like the Dark Universe, or the DCEU. Even though this is a movie combining superheroes from 4 different franchises, how many movies do you really have to watch before watching the Avengers? The answer is: 0. The Avengers does such a great job on its own establishing these characters. It is also one of the most enjoyable movies. The witty banter between the Avengers works so well. Whedon does a great job of presenting the theme of how people are stronger together. This movie perfectly demonstrates how being a team is more than just a bunch of people that are always giving each other nonsense, its about willing to put your differences aside to work together. Loki is one of the best villains in the MCU. The final battle is amazing, with so many cool moments, especially when the Avengers Assemble for the first time to fight against the Chitauri.

Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston and others all have great performances as various heroes and villains. Hiddleston's Loki is a great villain who doesn't overpower his opposition with brute strength, but with his wit. The script humanizes these characters and makes them all the more relatable to the viewers. The added moments of humor are a welcomed addition to an otherwise serious story. The set designs, whether CGI or practical, look great and help transport us into the heroes' world. This movie's action and spectacle are amazing. The fighting is well choreographed and often enhanced by context. This is not just a superhero film focused on big action, it has a lot of substance to it as well.

Diversos elementos nesse filme funcionam muito bem. Temos personagens que, por si só, já são interessantes e carismáticos, e esse até então não era o desafio. Acontece que o roteiro sabe muito bem como conduzir a visão de cada um sem que isso parecesse forçado, na realidade, até se acrescenta ao personagem. Isso fica muito mais evidente para quem assistiu os filmes subsequentes e percebe muito bem referências que são, na realidade, futuras a trama. Loki é super carismático e fez com que amássemos o odiar, ocupando perfeitamente o papel do vilão. O início da relação entre o Cap. América e Tony Stark é no mínimo intrigante, e cada um parece ter sua verdade em determinados momentos.

Se tem uma coisa que funciona bem aqui é o alívio cômico. Nos pega em momentos certeiros, são bem engraçados e quebra o clima pesado - que não é o propósito do filme. As cenas de luta são boas de modo geral, com claro destaque aquelas onde o plano é mais aberto e se utilizam dois ou mais heróis, combinando seus poderes; é lindo e extremamente satisfatório de se ver.

But with this movie it's  pure and everything is important they didn't and they couldn't add nothing could of been cut out. Also Robert Downey Jr. Is way better in this movie than he isn't endgame. Loki is also a really good villain he all like shakespearean and of like he talks in metaphors. Like  when Nick fury is like trying to steal the  tesseract and he and Loki have a conversation and when Loki says, "" I will make a world free"" then Nick says, "" free from what?""  ""free of freedom, freedom is the one lie we tell ourselves and once we accept that then you will truly be free."" that I the Nick's like,""We have no quarrel with your people"" he says an ant has no quarrel with a boot,""  "" do you plan on stepping on us?""

The writing shows improvement since previous Marvel Studios films, making the dialogue purposeful and the one-liners are actually funny and not overly cheesy. The choreography in the fight scenes is perfect, with characters using moves that are unique to them and their powers. The CGI and visual effects are incredible, speaking of which, the Hulk's character model is improved as well, making him more realistic looking and actually resembling Mark Ruffalo, who is a welcomed actor replacement as the character of Bruce Banner. Thor and Captain America seem to fit better as side characters in this film, and the interactions between them and Iron Man are full of chemistry. Robert Downey Jr. is on point as usual.

The Avengers

Whedon is much better a writer than he is a director. On a scale of McQuarrie, disappointingly Joss Whedon, the director, wouldn't even qualify as one. For when it comes to map the ever longed battles by the fans, he takes things lightly a lot. Whatever glory that bedazzles you on the screen, is a pure feat of bravery on paper not on screen. Too much cheese and too much sweet, his self-earned jaw dropping moments, are spoiled by him by the bitter afterbirth of his fandom. Fortunately, these battles are here as the starters, the main course is the ""build-up"" to that battle.

Whether then you watch gleefully these characters argue egotistically or see a train of awe-gasping moves by them to overpower each other on screen. There lies a profound poetry between these moments where you can see 8 year old Whedon playing with his toys in his room, creating banal engaging scenarios between Captain and Tony. This crowd pleasing franchise saw the maybe-expected uplift from this chapter, as it managed to bring out every adored content, from humor to drama to juicy visual effects. The dollars were written in the script and so it was visible on screen.

Among all the triumphs of Whedon, his biggest is combining these behemoth figures and weave out a compelling conversation that is worth ten times any battle shown. Downey is the singular actor that comes out with a sigh, his performance isn't interfered by the intertwining of multiple plots, which it seems like it did to others. If aligned the priorities of the makers, the characteristics of the characters that evolves into an essential element in the storytelling, is their way in, for this safe formula wasn't inscrutable enough to convince us that these guys, The Avengers, can avenge.",3.5,2019-04,9,"all:0.03, an:0.03, and:0.09, any:0.05, are:0.07, as:0.11, avengers:0.05, battle:0.10, battles:0.13, better:0.05, between:0.11, bring:0.06, build:0.06, by:0.23, can:0.08, captain:0.05, characters:0.07, compelling:0.06, course:0.07, did:0.05, director:0.12, downey:0.06, each:0.05, effects:0.05, engaging:0.07, enough:0.06, even:0.05, ever:0.04, every:0.05, fans:0.05, for:0.06, franchise:0.05, from:0.08, guys:0.07, hard:0.06, he:0.10, here:0.06, him:0.06, his:0.31, humor:0.05, if:0.04, in:0.11, into:0.05, is:0.20, isn:0.06, it:0.11, joss:0.10, like:0.04, lot:0.05, main:0.06, moments:0.11, much:0.13, multiple:0.06, not:0.04, of:0.16, old:0.06, on:0.23, one:0.03, or:0.05, other:0.05, out:0.12, performance:0.06, pure:0.06, saw:0.06, screen:0.19, script:0.05, see:0.09, so:0.04, takes:0.07, team:0.04, than:0.05, that:0.16, the:0.35, their:0.04, them:0.05, then:0.05, there:0.04, these:0.23, things:0.06, this:0.07, times:0.06, to:0.18, tony:0.06, too:0.09, up:0.03, us:0.05, visual:0.06, was:0.03, watch:0.05, way:0.04, were:0.05, what:0.04, whedon:0.24, when:0.05, where:0.06, which:0.05, with:0.06, worth:0.06, you:0.11"

Clearly the entire budget went on the CGI in the last act, because most of the first half of the movie looks like a TV series. Seriously. Look at how some of the shots are constructed. This is TV studio level direction.

Credit to Marvel for having the direction and commitment to bringing the MCU into existence and linking everything together into a payoff, but unless you have a massive investment in the characters this is not really anything special, with a by the numbers plot involving massive egos learning to get over their individual dick sizes and work together to defeat a common threat.

2018-11-27,"Joss Whedon has brought us the movie that comic book geeks have been waiting for. Marvel's The Avengers. Robert Downey Jr. plays Iron Man, Chris Evans plays Captain America, Chris Hemsworth plays The Mighty Thor, Scarlett Johansson plays Black Widow, Jeremy Renner plays Hawkeye, Mark Ruffalo plays The Incredible Hulk, Tom Hiddleston plays the baddie Loki and Samuel L.Jackson plays Nick Fury. The change between Mark Ruffalo and Edward Norton was actually the right choice to make because Mark Ruffalo plays Bruce Banner and lot better than Edward Norton did. This movie was a real game changer because this was the first ever comic book movie when a group of heroes team up which made this film very unique and the best movie that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has produced. 

Loki, the adopted brother of Thor, teams-up with the Chitauri Army and uses the Tesseract's power to travel from Asgard to Midgard to plot the invasion of Earth and become a king. The director of the agency S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury, sets in motion project Avengers, joining Tony Stark a.k.a. the Iron Man; Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America; Bruce Banner, a.k.a. The Hulk; Thor; Natasha Romanoff, a.k.a. Black Widow; and Clint Barton, a.k.a. Hawkeye, to save the world from the powerful Loki and the alien invasion. 

This film have amazing SFX and the entire New York fight scene was CGI and it look so real. This film has an engaging plot which is brilliantly acted and I would highly recommend that you watch it.

2018-11-24,"A remarkable movie easily fulfilled and then exceeded all expectations. I've been waiting for this movie since Sam Jackson's character uttered those famous words after the first Iron Man film. Out of the 3 of the Avengers films, this one is the best. This film shared flashbacks with past films. Which was fine. Mark Ruffalo made his first appearance playing the hulk as a re-cast and I'm glad to say he's much better than the last actor who played him, Edward Norton. Mark Ruffalo brought more mystery to the Bruce Banner character. All that Norton brand was put a random homeless character on the big screen. I didn't know this, but apparently, all of New York was CGI in the movie. 

It was great and not just the setting. The Hulk was as well. The Hulk scary chase scene was so horrifying. Jeremy Renner character was very creative and we didn't get much of Hawkeye in Thor. All we got is him drawing his bow and that's it. He didn't even shoot. Loki shouldn't of fake death at the end of Thor. Terrible twist. The relationship between Thor and Hulk was hilarious. The S.H.I.E.L.D. aircraft was an incredible visual effect. This will boost the team based comic book movies a lot. Thanks to the film's success.

This film was definitely my favorite out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The aliens were quite interesting - and seeing Captain America fight again was exciting.

2018-07-15,"Marvels The Avengers 2012 was truly a build up of anticipation. After each of our hero's solo outings we see the characters and personalities come together in such a way that feels realistic and grounded, despite the fact that aliens are soon to fall out of the sky. Introduction and motivation to characters drives the movie, but beyond that we see that of course these individuals don't all get along at first. Why would they? The idea of them becoming a team is what pushes the film forward. 
Director Joss Whedon takes he's experience from Buffy, Angel and Firefly and seamlessly builds the narrative with these already interesting characters. The action is nothing short of mind blowing and the CGI is seem less, particularly the work put into the hulk who's never looked better. 
Loki, our villain from the film returns after the events of Thor (2011) is the one we all love to hate. What we as the audience can take away from he's character is that we understand he's motivations through real and understandable emotion. Truly the best villain Marvel had done thus far.

2018-05-12,"Following four years' worth of movies building up for this moment, ""The Avengers"" is the big crossover that finishes the first phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, by bringing together some of Earth's mightiest heroes. When the Asgardian prince Loki makes a deal with the leader of the Chituari army to subjugate Earth, S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury has to bring together a group of remarkable people to stop this Alien threat. That includes Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, Black Widow, Thor and Hawkeye all teaming up to save the world, as hard as it might be interacting with each other, due to their different personalities. But this team-up works. The ensemble cast is perfect, especially Robert Downey Jr., which reprises his role as playboy-genius-billionaire Tony Stark. Joss Whedon manages to make everyone in this group of heroes shine. The characters are as complex as it gets, the humor is on point, the action is otherworldly and the most impressive at the time this film came out, the stakes are high and it just delivers on every level, living up to the expectations and the promises its predecessors created in the minds of the fans. All in all, it's pretty much the perfect comic book/superhero movie and the epitome of how all blockbusters should be made, filled with a little bit of everything to make this an unforgettable cinematic experience that will be discussed for decades to come.",5.0,2018-05,12,"action:0.04, all:0.14, america:0.06, an:0.04, and:0.12, are:0.09, as:0.22, at:0.05, avengers:0.03, be:0.14, big:0.06, bit:0.06, black:0.07, book:0.06, bring:0.07, bringing:0.07, building:0.08, but:0.04, by:0.06, came:0.07, captain:0.06, cast:0.06, characters:0.04, cinematic:0.13, come:0.06, comic:0.05, crossover:0.07, delivers:0.08, different:0.07, director:0.07, downey:0.07, each:0.06, earth:0.14, ensemble:0.07, especially:0.07, every:0.06, everyone:0.06, everything:0.06, expectations:0.08, experience:0.07, fans:0.07, filled:0.08, film:0.04, first:0.04, for:0.07, fury:0.07, gets:0.07, group:0.15, hard:0.07, has:0.05, hawkeye:0.07, heroes:0.10, high:0.08, his:0.06, how:0.05, hulk:0.06, humor:0.06, in:0.10, iron:0.06, is:0.11, it:0.11, its:0.05, joss:0.06, jr:0.07, just:0.05, level:0.08, little:0.06, loki:0.05, made:0.06, make:0.12, makes:0.06, man:0.06, marvel:0.04, might:0.08, mightiest:0.08, moment:0.07, most:0.06, movie:0.02, movies:0.04, much:0.05, nick:0.08, of:0.22, on:0.09, other:0.06, out:0.05, people:0.06, perfect:0.11, phase:0.06, point:0.07, pretty:0.07, robert:0.07, save:0.08, shine:0.08, should:0.07, some:0.05, stop:0.08, superhero:0.04, team:0.05, that:0.10, the:0.43, their:0.05, this:0.16, thor:0.06, threat:0.08, time:0.04, to:0.25, together:0.09, tony:0.08, universe:0.06, up:0.17, whedon:0.06, when:0.05, which:0.06, widow:0.07, will:0.06, with:0.11, works:0.07, world:0.06, worth:0.07, years:0.07"

With the Iron man leading up a team of reluctant heroes in order to save the world from Loki and his band of mindless minions. The three main heroes, Iron man, Captain America, and Thor, all shine through. The real surprise though is Hulk. Mark Ruffalo calls in a memorable performance to bring a smile to any comic book fan. His one liners and erratic behavior makes to an enjoyable performance. The one that is held back by the crowded lineup is Hawkeye. Set to be a mindless drone that does Loki's bidding for a majority of the film. This is a real waste of the talent of Jeremy Renner. The man can act with the best of them and he is assigned to a role that is forgettable. The directing style of Joss Whedon is felt for sure. His mannerisms and comedy is felt throughout this film.

Skip the obvious fun-ness of a solid lineup of charismatic heroes of well-made solo franchises, this is a good flick and not a great movie. I hate harping on ""believe-ability"" especially pertaining to sci-fi movies but there are massive, blazing plausibility issues within this story. Is a meager squadron of slow, un-stealthy, poorly armed aliens flying chariots through a single 100 ft. bottleneck over NYC, which is located in the United States, the largest and most dangerous arsenal in the world really an existential threat to the World Security Council, SHIELD, The Avengers, planet Earth? Thanos & Loki must have been high when they cooked up this plan. The Avengers were equally misguided in showing up for this fight considering the whole problem could've been solved by a single surface-to-air guided missile battery.

Predictably, the good guys don't get along at first but they eventually come together to defend Earth from some seriously bland and generic aliens who aren't intimidating at all.
 
Coulson's death was supposed to be a pivotal moment in the film, but absolutely no one cared about him so that just totally fell flat.

Tom Hiddleston gave a very limp-wristed performance as Loki.  Apparently he reasoned that Loki sounds like ""low-key"" so why not play the character that way?

The action sequences were all lackluster.  Like all the other PG-13 comic book movies, the fights are all sanitized of blood, gore and anything that would be too violent.

I liked how they cut from hero to hero in the recruiting process in the beginning, giving us a glimpse at what each hero was up to during their ""break"". I like how cap stays old fashioned. Captain America and Iron Man coming together and meeting for the first time was classic and really foreshadowed at Civil War. The writers did a good job showing how they have to have altercations before they come together and they finally come together after a well needed push (Phil Coulson's death). One of the best scenes in the history of movies is the revolving scene around the Avengers as they come together before war. Also I really enjoyed when it cut seamlessly from Avenger to Avenger each fighting their individual battles in the war. Great ending to the end of MCU phase 1. I love Marvel because it combines the world we all know with that of a fictional universe to aid our imaginations in creating fantasies about a combination of these universes where anything is possible.

In the mid-credits scene the Other speaks to his master (undoubtedly Thanos) about the failed attack on earth.

Yes, the CGI work is very good and the musical score is excellent. But it's the little details that make the characters feel real and involved that bring you along for the ride. One of my favorite tiny moments is the ""I don't...I don't see how that's a party"" line from Black Widow. In that one line, we're given a brief reminder that this is a very skilled human used to fighting very skilled human spies, who's now fighting aliens and monsters of epic proportions without the benefit of the near invulnerability of the super-powered individuals around her.
