2021-06-24,"It's a film that future generations will still be gushing about, much like previous generations did with such classics as Star Wars and Indiana Jones. It may not be perfect, but The Avengers lives up to its promise and delivers quite a punch. I feel The Avenger struggles as most superhero movies do with finding a way to naturally introduce its characters in a way that doesn't seem forced or formulaic. They do a decent job for what it is, but there are certain times you will feel the campiness of older works coming on as you view the film, and truly you just have to sit through it to get to the action that eventually will be at hand. Besides that though, there isn't many flaws. The acting is rather good, Samuel L. Jackson may take a line too seriously or too, but it's all in good fun. Again Tom Hiddleston as Loki is a major standout, and I also enjoyed the return of Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man and Chris Hemsworth Thor- as well as an improved performance by Chris Evans as Captain America and a great performance from replacement Hulk actor Mark Ruffalo. The action scenes are exciting and tense, there is some camera angles here and there that can be a bit annoying, but for the most part it is rather clear and not awfully tedious action- as many films of this type could be. In the end, despite its campiness and formulaic actions- The Avengers is an incredibly fun time. It takes pride in its stories and characters and makes the most out of an experience that could have easily been phoned in. Its a film that will live on for some time, and one i'm rather glad I got to experience first hand.My Rating: 9.4/10.",9.0,2021-06,Thursday,"10:0.05, about:0.04, acting:0.06, action:0.10, actor:0.07, again:0.06, all:0.03, also:0.05, america:0.04, an:0.11, and:0.28, are:0.06, as:0.24, at:0.04, avenger:0.07, avengers:0.06, be:0.16, been:0.05, bit:0.06, but:0.11, by:0.04, can:0.04, captain:0.04, characters:0.07, chris:0.11, coming:0.07, could:0.10, did:0.05, do:0.10, doesn:0.06, downey:0.05, end:0.06, enjoyed:0.07, evans:0.06, exciting:0.08, experience:0.15, feel:0.12, film:0.10, films:0.05, first:0.04, for:0.08, from:0.04, fun:0.11, get:0.05, good:0.07, got:0.06, great:0.04, have:0.06, hemsworth:0.06, here:0.06, hiddleston:0.06, hulk:0.03, in:0.12, iron:0.04, is:0.14, isn:0.07, it:0.16, its:0.24, jackson:0.06, job:0.06, jr:0.05, just:0.04, like:0.03, line:0.07, loki:0.04, makes:0.06, man:0.04, many:0.10, mark:0.05, may:0.13, most:0.14, movies:0.04, much:0.04, my:0.04, not:0.06, of:0.09, on:0.07, one:0.03, or:0.08, out:0.04, part:0.06, perfect:0.06, performance:0.15, previous:0.07, quite:0.06, rather:0.24, rating:0.08, robert:0.05, ruffalo:0.05, samuel:0.06, scenes:0.05, seem:0.08, some:0.08, star:0.07, still:0.05, such:0.06, superhero:0.04, take:0.06, takes:0.07, that:0.18, the:0.25, there:0.15, they:0.04, this:0.02, thor:0.04, though:0.06, through:0.06, time:0.08, times:0.06, to:0.13, tom:0.06, too:0.10, truly:0.08, up:0.04, way:0.10, well:0.04, what:0.04, will:0.16, with:0.06, you:0.10"

2012-04-16,"LA Review of 'The Avengers' (No spoilers)I was lucky enough to attend the Marvel screening of 'The Avengers' on Saturday morning in Century City, CA. This was an unusual screening as movies of this caliber are not screened some three weeks before it's release date. Just minutes before the movie started, we were all surprised when writer/director Joss Whedon walked in with Kevin Feige to introduced their little ""Justice League"" movie. Not only did we all laugh, but some booed. lol. If that wasn't enough of a surprise, the soft spoken Whedon introduced on stage Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), Clark Gregg (Agent Coulson) and Cobie Smulders (Agent Maria Hill). Wow is she stunning in person! The audience gave them all a standing ovation with deafening cheers! (This explained why the secret service like security were searching, wanding everyone. No cameras, cell phones, nothing was allowed in.) What a nice surprise for an early Saturday morning screening. I've never read comic books. This is a comic book movie. It was made for hardcore fans of comics, and I appreciate the care Joss Whedon gives to this movie. It was very entertaining to see Tony Stark (Iron Man), Thor, Dr. Bruce Banner (Hulk), Steve Rogers (Captain America), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), Clint Barton (Hawkeye), Agent Maria Hill, Agent Phil Coulson and Director Nick Fury all interact with one another. Capt. Steve Rogers was fighting in WWII just yesterday. Having been recently awoken from his frozen sleep, he struggles to fit in our modern world with all this technology around us. The God of Thunder, Thor, is not from this world (realm) and doesn't understand modern technology on Earth as well. Dr. Bruce Banner has been on the run from the government, practicing medicine in third world countries. He hasn't been the Hulk in two years (What's his secret? ;). Tony Stark is still the same, playing with this high tech toys and inventing new technology. So how do you get them all to interact and play well together? Well, Director Joss Whedon is the secret to making it all work. The highlight of the film for me is how Joss Whedon has all these characters interact. Deep character development was not needed for this film. (That is what the respective movies are for: Thor, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger) He does a great job of not forcing dialogue, and the interaction of the characters is much more organic than I would have ever anticipated. That is where Whedon deserves the most credit. He took what appears to be a very silly premise, with silly looking characters and made it completely work. Seeing as the Avengers comics date back to the 1960s, you can tell he not only did his homework, but he really cares deeply for the material, and his passion definitely shows on- screen. The movie is vastly entertaining. The Action scenes are amazing and satisfying. Nobody is short changed when it comes to the fighting or action sequences. I felt as if there was not a single bad performance. A couple of dialogue lines seemed off, but once you remember who the character is, and why they talk the way they do (think of where they come from), it all makes sense. Each respective character is true and honest to itself. Each of the characters brought their personality (from their respective movie) to the table. It is by far the best Marvel movie to date.So who was my personal favorite character from the movie? Dr. Bruce Banner (played by Mark Ruffalo) of course! He is by far the BEST Bruce Banner/Hulk since Bill Bixby. His intelligence (genius) is unparalleled (greater than Tony Stark's) and his compassion for human lives is what drives the good side of his character. As a kid growing up, he was my favorite Marvel super hero. I enjoyed watching Bill Bixby play medical doctor/physicist Dr. David Banner on television. I'd watch, terrified with my hands up to my face, as he transformed into the raging green hulk. Yet i was so fascinated with him being a scientist, helping those in need. When Mark Ruffalo was first announced to play Bruce Banner, i didn't know what to think of it. I knew that he's a good actor. All he needs is the right director to get the needed on-screen character out of him. I really hope they make an Incredible Hulk movie sequel starring Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner. Or at least, i vote for him to reprise his role in any sequel. He was a natural fit for this role. Overall, the best thing about these characters is that they are not silly twenty-something terrible actors who were chosen for on-screen eye candy. They all do a fine job of bringing these characters to life and their chemistry together works great. Assembled, they are unstoppable. When i heard an Avengers movie was rumored to be in the works, i was ecstatic. The day has finally come. Go see it.

2021-08-21,"This might be controversial to say but this is my personal favorite MCU movie. Up until this point, nothing had been done like this in film and it was executed magnificently. Going into this movie in 2012 (having only seen Iron Man beforehand) I was skeptical and not interested. Then my brother took us to the theater to see it and it was one hell of a blast. I was blown away and wanted to watch all of the other Phase 1 movies and learn more about these other heroes. The casting and chemistry between them is on point, the villain is compelling and gets under your skin in the best way, and Robert Downey Jr.'s humor all around is unforgettable, and how can I not mention that glorifying theme song??

2012-05-12,"At this point, ""The Avengers"" has made around 100 trillion dollars (or so)--and so it's obvious that people love the film. My own daughter went to the premier in New York and then went to it on opening night in general release--and was mad I didn't take her with me tonight to see it! Obviously, she loved the film as well. As for me, I liked it but didn't quite share the overall exuberance for the film. Mind you, I liked it--but I think I preferred the earlier films before the Avengers team was formed. There was a certain charm that I didn't quite see recaptured in the film. Now the film is good--it's just that what I like in these other films I would have liked more of in ""The Avengers"". Specifically, the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development. When I read the IMDb trivia, it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutes--all showing Steve Rogers (Captain America) trying to adjust to his new life. I would have LOVED seeing all this--and less of the HUGE battle at the end of the film. For me, it just felt numbing after a while and I would have liked more of the characters when they weren't fighting. Again, however, I DID like the film....but the earlier Marvel/Disney films I liked just a bit better.

2012-04-15,"I was lucky enough to be included in the group to see the advanced screening in Melbourne on the 15th of April, 2012. And, firstly, I need to say a big thank-you to Disney and Marvel Studios.Now, the film... how can I even begin to explain how I feel about this film? It is, as the title of this review says a 'comic book triumph'. I went into the film with very, very high expectations and I was not disappointed.Seeing Joss Whedon's direction and envisioning of the film come to life on the big screen is perfect. The script is amazingly detailed and laced with sharp wit a humor. The special effects are literally mind-blowing and the action scenes are both hard-hitting and beautifully choreographed.While all of these things (script, action, special effects and so on and so forth) are important... it's no good having them spot on if you don't have a cast that just isn't right. But fortunately, for fans and for the actors involved, Whedon's cast not only work brilliantly together but are perfectly comfortable wailing on each other and threatening each other all day and night.The actors' performances in ""Marvel's The Avengers"" are simply captivating and there are many instances where we get a glimpse further into their characters pasts and innermost feelings. Robert Downey Jr. will have you in stitches. Scarlett Johansson will have you staring in disbelief as she winds her way through sticky situations. And Tom Hiddleston will have you simply shaking in your seat with fear.All in all, Marvel's The Avengers is a visual delight and I cannot wait to see it again, and again, and again. Marvel fans will not be disappointed, and something tells me that most of you will agree with me wholeheartedly.The Avengers, assembled and awe-inspiring.

2012-04-14,"I just saw the early screening for San Diego through the top 10 cities on facebook who got them. And suffice to say I am glad I was privileged enough to.First off, this hands down is the best Marvel movie ever. I don't say that lightly. And in terms of superhero movie with maybe the Nolan Batman series being tied with this, I thought Whedon did an amazing job to bring out all these characters in this one movie. I especially like what was done with Hawkeye and Black Widow just because those two didn't really have their individual movie with their back story. You can tell when a comic book fan writes and directs a comic movie because it clearly showed in all areas of production for this film. Going into the film I honestly thought that a lot of the cool mutant action scenes would be strictly Iron Man and Captain America. But Whedon does such a great job giving each mutant their 15 mins of fame and by the end of it you seriously feel like ""Wow this guy/chick is a badass"" for every mutant. I will admit i am not a Hulk fan. I like the inner story for it but was never a fan of the films, show or comic. But Hulk's role in the movie is so awesome I became a fan just from it. If any of you are Whedon fans then you guys/girls will love this movie. It has his M.O. written all over the humor and story presentation. And there were definitely parts in the movie where I thought ""Wow this seems like Firefly and Serenity"". And story aside, if you read, watched, or idolized Marvel superheros as a kid, the action alone will make you cheer just out of sheer nostalgia of imagining The Avengers or X-Men all together on the screen kicking ass. In summation, I don't need to say you NEED to watch this movie because I think anybody who is anybody already knows they want to see this. All this review has done was just reaffirm the hype behind this movie. I don't say this much but job well done Marvel and Disney for hiring a writer/director who has the audaciousness to keep it honest and true for those most dedicated comic fans who are the backbone of Marvel comics being a success.

2013-06-02,"I missed this movie when it came out at the cinema because, from what I could see from the trailers and elsewhere, it looked a bit 'silly' for want of a better word, kid's stuff perhaps. We've come to expect much more from comic book interpretations. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the Iron Man series, Spiderman and Batman reboots. Where I draw the line I think, is with characters such as Thor and Captain America and to a lesser extent the Hulk - characters who haven't dated too well at all and should have been left in their respective times. They just look so out of place sitting along side the more believable and 'cooler' looking characters like Iron man in present day settings. But anyhow, having seen the high ratings the movie was getting (including on here) I thought 'maybe it cant be so bad after all?' and gave it a look. Sadly my initial instinct was right - this film is well made, has great CGI and acting, but.. its entirely spoilt by the inclusion of silly outdated characters with dubious special powers and a guy who turns into a CGI cartoon green man/monster. I realise that it wouldn't be as much of an assemble without these characters and to substitute spiderman or other superheroes might well upset some purists, but might have made for a better film. Thor in particular is from a bygone era of comic books and should have been left there.",6.0,2013-06,Sunday,"acting:0.07, after:0.06, all:0.07, along:0.09, america:0.05, an:0.04, and:0.29, as:0.07, assemble:0.09, at:0.09, bad:0.07, batman:0.09, be:0.08, because:0.06, been:0.11, better:0.12, bit:0.08, book:0.07, but:0.10, by:0.05, came:0.09, captain:0.05, cgi:0.15, characters:0.22, cinema:0.09, come:0.07, comic:0.12, could:0.06, day:0.10, don:0.06, enjoyed:0.09, expect:0.09, film:0.08, for:0.07, from:0.18, get:0.06, getting:0.10, great:0.05, guy:0.08, has:0.05, have:0.12, haven:0.10, having:0.08, here:0.07, high:0.08, hulk:0.04, in:0.09, into:0.06, iron:0.09, is:0.09, it:0.14, its:0.06, just:0.04, left:0.19, like:0.04, line:0.09, look:0.17, looking:0.09, made:0.12, man:0.13, maybe:0.09, me:0.05, might:0.18, more:0.10, movie:0.06, much:0.11, my:0.05, of:0.13, on:0.04, or:0.05, other:0.05, out:0.09, place:0.10, powers:0.10, really:0.05, right:0.07, see:0.05, seen:0.06, series:0.09, should:0.14, so:0.09, some:0.05, special:0.07, stuff:0.10, such:0.07, superheroes:0.06, that:0.03, the:0.23, their:0.05, there:0.05, these:0.06, they:0.04, think:0.06, this:0.06, thor:0.09, thought:0.08, times:0.08, to:0.08, too:0.06, ve:0.07, want:0.08, was:0.07, we:0.06, well:0.14, what:0.05, when:0.05, where:0.07, who:0.11, with:0.07, without:0.08, wrong:0.09"
2014-08-10,"Superhero films are always fun to watch when they are done right, and while to some degree it is understandable why people wouldn't be totally enamoured with it(as seen in a lot of the negative comments, a lot of them being condescending though- enough with the ignorant conspiracy theories already!- and some not even worthy of being called reviews) Avengers Assemble for me was an example of a fun and intelligent superhero film that was done right. True, the story is formulaic but not to the extent that was too distracting. In fact my only two complaint was to do with one performances that didn't quite work personally. And that was Jeremy Renner who was rather on the dull side as Hawkeye, whose character development did seem a little rushed and underwritten, that Hawkeye has inner demons is made very clear but it could have come through more strongly. However the rest of the performances were great, a big shout out going to Tom Hiddleston who is serpentine personified as Loki, though Robert Downey Jnr's charismatic Iron Man, Samuel L. Jackson's no-nonsense Nick Fury, Mark Ruffalo's very confident Hulk(he doesn't make you miss Eric Bana or Ed Norton), Chris Hemsworth's dynamic and not wimpy Thor(if he was I put it down to his hidden demons character development) and Chris Evans' modest, heartfelt Captain America were equally great. Scarlett Johansson convinces mostly too, Black Widow's back story is intriguing and Johansson is wonderful when she acts fearless but when in her emotional, imploring moments her acting is rather forced and out of character for Black Widow. For a film with as many characters as seen here, Avengers Assemble still makes a vast majority of them very interesting(only Hawkeye really disappointed), in character and not one-sided and all of them have their turn to shine. It didn't feel to me like a film that tried to cram in too many heroes all at once for the sake of it. The film is very slickly made with astounding special effects and dazzlingly executed stunt-work. Alan Silvestri's score pulsates with power and the action sequences are exciting. The story may be formulaic and standard good-and-evil but is crisply paced and intelligently handled with just the right blend of humour, pathos and action with not one component over-shadowing the others. What was really enjoyable especially was the toe-to-toe with Thor and Iron Man and Hulk. What was really remarkable was the script, filled with thoughtful exposition and snappy banter that stayed true to The Avengers while also with Joss Whedon's own style that was apparent in a lot of his other work. Overall, Avengers Assemble may not be 100% perfect or among the best ever but it is still an outstanding film with a lot to love about it, and no this is not coming from a fake account or a plant, just someone who can be hard to please who genuinely enjoyed it. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,2014-08,Sunday,"10:0.04, about:0.03, acting:0.04, action:0.04, all:0.04, already:0.05, also:0.03, always:0.04, america:0.03, an:0.05, and:0.31, are:0.07, as:0.10, assemble:0.15, at:0.03, avengers:0.08, back:0.04, be:0.09, being:0.07, best:0.03, big:0.04, black:0.07, but:0.09, can:0.03, captain:0.03, character:0.12, characters:0.02, chris:0.08, come:0.04, coming:0.05, could:0.03, development:0.10, did:0.03, didn:0.08, disappointed:0.05, do:0.03, doesn:0.04, done:0.08, down:0.04, downey:0.03, effects:0.03, enjoyed:0.05, enough:0.04, especially:0.04, evans:0.04, even:0.03, ever:0.03, evil:0.05, exciting:0.05, fact:0.05, feel:0.04, film:0.12, films:0.03, for:0.07, from:0.02, fun:0.07, fury:0.04, going:0.04, good:0.02, great:0.05, hard:0.05, has:0.03, have:0.04, hawkeye:0.11, he:0.06, hemsworth:0.04, her:0.10, here:0.04, heroes:0.03, hiddleston:0.04, his:0.06, however:0.04, hulk:0.05, humour:0.06, if:0.03, in:0.10, interesting:0.05, iron:0.05, is:0.17, it:0.14, jackson:0.04, jeremy:0.04, johansson:0.08, joss:0.03, just:0.05, like:0.02, little:0.04, loki:0.03, lot:0.15, love:0.04, made:0.06, make:0.03, makes:0.04, man:0.05, many:0.07, mark:0.03, may:0.09, me:0.06, moments:0.04, more:0.03, my:0.03, nick:0.04, no:0.06, norton:0.05, not:0.15, of:0.16, on:0.02, once:0.05, one:0.06, only:0.06, or:0.08, other:0.03, others:0.05, out:0.05, over:0.04, overall:0.04, own:0.04, people:0.04, perfect:0.04, performances:0.10, power:0.05, put:0.04, quite:0.04, rather:0.11, really:0.08, renner:0.04, rest:0.05, reviews:0.05, right:0.12, robert:0.03, ruffalo:0.03, samuel:0.04, scarlett:0.04, script:0.04, seem:0.06, seen:0.07, sequences:0.05, she:0.05, some:0.06, special:0.04, still:0.07, story:0.09, superhero:0.06, that:0.14, the:0.24, their:0.03, them:0.09, they:0.02, this:0.02, thor:0.05, though:0.08, through:0.04, to:0.20, tom:0.04, too:0.10, true:0.10, two:0.04, very:0.12, was:0.23, watch:0.03, were:0.06, what:0.05, whedon:0.03, when:0.09, while:0.08, who:0.12, why:0.04, widow:0.07, with:0.23, work:0.12, you:0.02"
2012-08-02,"'The Avengers', first of all, is a good movie. While sometimes overlong, it's entertaining, and the action scenes are amazing. However, it doesn't have enough depth to be another one of those ""classic superhero films"". The reputation instead should be ""enjoyable superhero flick"". First off, if an effort is made to assemble all of MARVEL's Avengers, that effort must be made with a little more success than this. 'The Avengers' ends up feeling like more sequel than spin-off, instead of studying and developing each character. If we're supposed to care about all these superheroes...give them noticeable differences, more display of emotions, and a distinctive background. Just because they're superheroes who have some funny one-liners doesn't mean the viewers will automatically think they're the best people who ever lived. In other words, the characters have too little depth. Something that bugs me is that a few people have been saying this is better than Christopher Nolan's ""Batman"" trilogy, yet the latter is a perfect example of a series of films that have greatly influenced (and perhaps even transcended) the superhero genre. In 'The Dark Knight' there wasn't a single character who was ""just there for nothing"". Meanwhile, Loki is an uninteresting villain and doesn't hold a candle to Heath Ledger's disturbing, brilliant portrayal of The Joker (who, on the other hand, actually seems like a villain even when he's just not doing anything). How come 'The Avengers' all have to work to defeat Loki and his army, while Hulk can simply toss him around like a plastic spoon? That said, the long action sequence where the assembled Avengers all defeat Loki's army is quite outstanding, and many detractors of this film admit that this is also the best part. It contains amazing cinematography, like a minute-long shot that steadily observes each Avenger and sees how they're doing with the aliens. Of course, the rest of the action scenes are also top-notch, considering there's fighting for most of the movie. The sequence with Black Widow running away from The Hulk is especially memorable, and displays arguably the most likable Avenger here, along with Iron Man. The two that we care the most about.Overall, I'd say that 'The Avengers' could have been cut about 20-30 minutes short to flow more as a superhero film. I had hoped for more character development, since there were so many characters to pay attention to. I loved the action, and was pleased with the clever action scenes, especially the last 40 minutes and the parts with Black Widow. It's undeniably entertaining, and while it's not transcendent and genius, it's a great popcorn-flick. Would I see it again?

2012-04-25,"The Avengers movie must be a dream come true to everyone. Seeing these superheroes uniting together to save the world in the big screen. While the heroes' stand alone films doesn't have that enough action, this movie executes more of their super abilities. It's really fun and exciting. A lot of people will cheer to their favorite superheroes. This is what all fans and moviegoers want in Avengers. More fighting, more explosions, more smashing, and more fun. In the end, you will crave for more because of its awesomeness. The Avengers is simply marvelous.Our modern blockbusters are just full of explosions that makes no sense, bland characters, and too long runtime. The runtime here is long but it's necessary. The storytelling is quite simple as it gets. We already knew who these characters are. The best part is when they develop their relationship to each other. This happened mostly in the second act. These scenes are funny and entertaining. It's more entertaining when there's Robert Downey Jr. stealing the show. Of course, he will always be like this. His chemistry with Bruce Banner is wonderful. Two geniuses working together. Other than that, the rest of the performances were also good. Chris Hemsworth is just mighty enough as Thor and Chris Evans is cool enough as Captain America. Scarlett Johansson is probably the weak link here. She's still sexy though.Maybe the only problem here is the secondary villains. They are not as dangerous or as threatening as they suppose to be which makes it too easy for Hulk to smash them. But it doesn't matter because there's Loki stealing all of his scenes once again. Tom Hiddleston is simply fantastic as Loki. The action is pretty awesome. It's suppose to be awesome! The Hulk nails it in these scenes. It's exciting to see him smash stuff with glory. While there's Iron Man flying, Thor wielding his hammer, Captain America throwing his shield, and Hawkeye shooting with his archer. More explosions, just what everyone wants. It's fantastically cool and fun.There are still compelling moments and drama here but the main attraction of this film is the action and explosions. The film also cares about the characters which makes it reasonable for us to care about them and cheer to them. It's a rare kind of blockbuster these days. It has clever humor, awesome action, and really fun characters. It makes the Fans and Moviegoers happy and amazed. This is the kind of blockbuster that people should watch. This film is just cool and highly recommended to see this summer. Though, I still think the first Iron Man movie is the best of this set, but still, this is a big, fun experience you will have in the big screen.",10.0,2012-04,Wednesday,"about:0.05, action:0.08, again:0.04, all:0.04, already:0.04, also:0.06, always:0.04, america:0.05, and:0.21, are:0.10, as:0.14, avengers:0.06, awesome:0.11, banner:0.04, be:0.08, because:0.06, best:0.05, big:0.10, blockbuster:0.09, bruce:0.04, but:0.07, captain:0.05, care:0.05, characters:0.09, chris:0.07, come:0.03, cool:0.14, course:0.04, doesn:0.08, downey:0.03, each:0.03, end:0.04, enough:0.12, entertaining:0.08, evans:0.04, everyone:0.08, exciting:0.10, experience:0.05, fans:0.08, fantastic:0.04, favorite:0.04, fighting:0.05, film:0.07, films:0.03, first:0.03, for:0.05, full:0.05, fun:0.17, funny:0.04, gets:0.04, good:0.02, has:0.02, have:0.04, hawkeye:0.03, he:0.03, hemsworth:0.04, here:0.15, heroes:0.03, hiddleston:0.04, highly:0.05, him:0.04, his:0.14, hulk:0.04, humor:0.04, in:0.09, iron:0.05, is:0.25, it:0.21, its:0.03, johansson:0.04, jr:0.03, just:0.09, kind:0.09, like:0.02, loki:0.05, long:0.08, lot:0.03, main:0.04, makes:0.14, man:0.05, maybe:0.05, moments:0.04, more:0.20, movie:0.05, must:0.04, no:0.03, not:0.02, of:0.15, once:0.04, only:0.03, or:0.03, other:0.05, our:0.05, part:0.04, people:0.07, performances:0.05, pretty:0.04, probably:0.04, quite:0.04, really:0.05, rest:0.05, robert:0.03, save:0.05, scarlett:0.04, scenes:0.09, screen:0.07, second:0.04, see:0.05, seeing:0.04, sense:0.05, set:0.04, she:0.05, should:0.04, show:0.04, simple:0.05, simply:0.10, stand:0.05, still:0.14, stuff:0.05, summer:0.05, super:0.03, superheroes:0.07, than:0.03, that:0.07, the:0.36, their:0.08, them:0.08, there:0.10, these:0.16, they:0.07, think:0.03, this:0.15, thor:0.05, though:0.08, to:0.16, together:0.06, tom:0.04, too:0.06, true:0.05, two:0.04, us:0.04, want:0.04, wants:0.06, watch:0.03, we:0.03, were:0.03, what:0.05, when:0.05, which:0.06, while:0.08, who:0.03, will:0.11, with:0.05, world:0.04, you:0.04"

2012-04-25,"Although Marvel Pictures have always made curious appointments in regards to their feature film directors the results have been mostly solid, if not spectacular thus far. I certainly didn't expect Jon Faverau to deliver one of the best comic-book movies ever – Iron Man. If it wasn't for DC's own Billionaire playboy superhero would've champion Iron Man as the best flick in the genre. Yes I do rate Iron Man that highly. Spider-Man 1 & 2 were good but didn't exactly capture the essence of Peter Parker while Spider-Man 3 was a huge mess, not Mark Steven Johnson mess, but a mess nonetheless. Last year's motion picture debuts of Marvel staples Thor and Captain America were also very good, very faithful to their respective source material. Joe Johnston redeemed himself after a misguided attempt at bringing the Wolfman back to the silver screen, whereas Kenneth Branaghs Shakespeare sensitive's proved a stroke of genius in fitting Thor into Marvel's motion picture universe. To be honest I even enjoyed 2008's The Incredible Hulk after Ang Lee damn near killed the franchise.Even though Marvel Pictures has proved time and again to make the right decisions when producing a movie on its own, the hiring of Joss Whedon seemed like an odd choice. Of course Joss Whedon is the genius behind TV-cult hits like Buffy, Angel and Firefly but his only foray into directing was 2005's Serenity. Managing all those superstar egos, handling multiple character arcs, dealing with several multimillion dollar franchises and making everyone happy from top brass executive down to the hardcore fanboys – to be honest, I wouldn't have entrusted him with a fraction of the $200-million-plus budget for The Avengers. Thus far only two directors have managed to pull off the impossible and accomodated several superheroes in a single movie – Bryan Singer (X-Men & X2) and Matthew Vaughn (X-Men First Class) while Brett Ratner ruined X-Men 3 with his unfocused direction. At first I thought Joss Whedon would do an even more terrible job than the latter, considering that Ratner had more filmmaking experience than Whedon at the time of filming X3. But nothing could be further from the truth. Joss Whedon is the MASTER, with a captial M.Let me say it out loud: JOSS WHEDON IS A COMIC BOOK MOVIE GOD. Unlike Ratner he actually cares about the characters and their development throughout the movie. You think Tony Stark would just waltz through the movie and roll over every other character? You are wrong. Though Robert Downey Jr. is in top form as he always is when he dons the Iron Man suit, the other characters are far from underdeveloped and don't crumble under the pressure of his larger-than-life persona. If anything it's the Hulk that absolutely steals the show. That said, I think we have found the definitive Bruce Banner, Mark Ruffalo, he absolutely owns the role. He is the Hulk and we finally got the Hulk we deserved. Everybody brings their A-game and every character gets a fair amount of screen time. I can't find any flaw in this movie. Of course the special effects are spectacular but it's the dialogue that won me over. Really. Each character in this movie has at least one or two memorable lines – not just Tony Stark. When you watch the Avengers make sure you listen to the dialogue carefully – I've never heard dialogue this witty in any comic movie, and I've watched my fair share. Joss Whedon you are the freaking man. They said it was impossible to accommodate this many characters in a single movie – they were wrong. From now on everyone will reference this movie whenever multiple larger-than-life figures are thrown into one supersized extravaganza – Yeah I'm slamming the last two Transformers flicks. I guarantee Joss Whedon would've done justice to the franchise. After watching the Avengers everything that bears the name of Joss Whedon is a must-see for me now. Final verdict: 10 out of 10. This movie is Iron Man on steroids.

2012-04-24,"Believe me when I say that 'The Avengers' was my most anticipated movie ever. I mean, come on, a bunch of superheroes gathering and fighting evil, that is just priceless. And not any superheroes but the most well-known and well-loved. The movie has some of the best actors in Hollywood portraying some of the best superheroes to have ever been created. This movie has loads of Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hawkeye, and, needless to say, Hulk Smash! They were all portrayed on screen brilliantly and I give thanks to the actor for making them feel awesome, cool, and really, really fun. I live in Australia and we get an earlier viewing of the film but for you Americans, this wait is is worth it. When the movie was over, most of the cinema clapped - this was the first time I had ever seen this ever at the movies. Even though it was 12 in the morning, the whole cinema was packed and all of them came out of the cinema satisfied and were glad they paid the $13 to watch it.The plot of the movie is straightforward but done magnificently. Loki, previously seen in Thor, wants to wreak havoc on Earth by letting a group of aliens enter Earth through a portal. It's up to the Avengers to stop him but first they have to solve the rivalries and bitterness between them. The fight scenes between the superheroes are just f*cking AWESOME! I was so excited to see Thor and Iron Man battle it out - that scene was just plain epic.The music and soundtrack in the movie was good and it did a nice job of alleviating the action, and trust me there is a LOT of action. The visual effects are also fantastic, one of the best I have ever seen in a film, and they will leave you in awe. Hulk, along with Iron Man, do a good job of adding humour into the film and ALL of the scenes with the Hulk left everyone at the cinemas laughing. It is pretty obvious that his squad mates think highly of him as seen in the scene where Stark and Loki have a confrontation ('We have an Army' , 'We have a Hulk'). That scene was what did it for me.If you guys are in doubt as to see this then let me assure you that you are gonna get the bang for your buck that you deserve. So far, it is one of the best superhero film made but of all time? Not really sure, guess we have to wait for TDKR to come out. 10/10 - Perfect!

2013-05-26,"The Avengers (2012)First: this is high energy stuff with lots of superhero fighting. Lots. Beyond that I had to pick and choose what I liked and what seemed to be dragged out a bit. It was never slow, but it was often a bit uninteresting.the real downside to the movie was, well, the plot, which had yet another super huge super awful enemy that required our local team to go out and find a way to conquer. It never really mattered why these bad people were coming (though they do explain why, with a spacey glowing cube and Thor's half-brother having some childhood issues unresolved). The set design, however, was really ambitious, not only with the huge scenes and big CGI effects, but the range and diversity of interiors with a deliberate variety of styles that related to the different characters. And some of the actors and actresses were terrific to watch, even if they didn't really have much to say or do that mattered (besides save the world, of course).If this sounds like I'm not cut out of this type of movie you are mostly wrong. I have loved, for example, the three Nolan ""Batman"" movies, a couple of the ""Spiderman"" ones, and a few oddballs here and there, all of which work on some of the same principles of super villain and a modified New York (Gotham, etc.) as a city of resilient victims to save.Small (relevant) confession: I loved the Iron Man movies and never saw any of the other Marvel character movies like the Hulk. In this all-star get together of a half dozen famous super-heroes I naturally loved the Iron Man parts and was neutral on the rest. Mostly because Robert Downey Jr. is a huge cut above the others of the cast in presence, in humor, in making the whole enterprise a comic book come to life, not a serious save-the-world epic. By contrast, the leader of the bad guys is a wan, half-hearted baddie who didn't create the chills or fear the movie badly needed. As a movie of characters taken from various Marvel comic book (and movie) series, it was how fully the characters were realized that made the difference. Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was pretty great, though restrained a bit. The Black Widow in the hands of Scarlett Johansson was stunning to look at but also weirdly restrained (except the fighting of course). Thor was a bore, taking his old school power thing too too seriously. And Captain America, though a likable, cute guy, was also a bad casting job--he had to do more than look good (unlike, say, Gwyneth Paltrow, who simply had to look good since she unfortunately had nothing much to say or do).You'll know if this movie is your thing before you read this or see a trailer. It's a boiler plate super hero action movie with lots of computer effects and a standard villain from the universe menace. (The computer effects, like these skeletal ocean monsters swimming through Manhattan wrecking lots of buildings, are actually, surprisingly, a bit clunky once you start watching the details.) Overall, director and writer Joss Whedon seems a bit overwhelmed here, and has co-written a predictable bit of very expensive contemporary Hollywood stuff and then directed it without quite making it special.

2012-04-25,"I'm not going to spoil anything or get very technical here. I don't usually write reviews. I did so because this movie took me back to my childhood like no other movie did.Sure, it's not intellectually pretentious or groundbreaking from a cinematic or storytelling point of view, but it delivers perfectly.The wit, conflict, adventure, heart and sense of wonder that I once found in my crazy uncle's attic, slumbering inside those weird looking and dusty Marvel Magazines - populated with super-soldiers, handsome flying scientists, Norse gods, green monsters and incredibly hot chicks in black leather - are here.As I grew up, I somehow repressed the idea that there was no such thing as fictional happiness. These characters will never exist, and it sure takes suspension of disbelief to watch them run about. But this movie reminded me of what they made me feel before girls, party nights, college,taxes and other complicated, serious things came along. As the movie ended, I felt overwhelmed by the readjustment to reality as I knew it in my young adult life.I watched this with my 10 year old nephew.

2012-08-20,"This movie is the definition of being over-hyped: Hardly any aspect of it has escaped being hailed as among the best of recent years, be it acting, special effects, fighting scenes or plot. In my opinion, it falls far, far short of that benchmark. The visual effects are very good, sure, but then so are the effects in Battleship.The acting isn't bad, but it's hardly impressive either. The few impressive performances are completely overshadowed by the very average writing. Platitudes, one-liners, soundbites and trailer lines are constant. Much of it makes no sense at all: Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is cautious about ""the other one"" and seems to dislike people knowing about it, yet he constantly references this. It's as if the writers thought ""We haven't shown Banner as the Hulk yet; better make him allude to that in his every line so people don't forget.""The largest problem with the movie, without a doubt, is the plot. The bad guy never feels threatening, his plan is extremely inefficient and frankly stupid in many ways, and the plot holes are too many to count. For instance, in one scene we see the Hulk being a mindless beast, destroying everything in his path, but later we see him taking orders. Add to that that the superhero who apparently has the power of super-aim misses whenever the script calls for it making his on-screen superpower ""is really good with a bow and arrow"". In one scene he misses half a dozen shots from a distance of 12 feet.On a related note, what is Captain Americas superpower compared to the others? Patriotism? Other Avengers are superiour in every single way. Ranged combat, close combat, mobility, intelligence, strength... Even his weapon is a worse version of Thors hammer. Not that Black Widow is any better, but at least she has some use in the plot.This movie is like The Expendables, only it takes itself seriously and has better acting.

2012-04-24,"The wait for this movie has been excruciatingly long, ever since we saw the preview that was attached to Captain America. Here's what I thought of the movie when I caught the premiere.You get the best of Joss Whedon and that is quite a lot:1. Black Widow is no longer just a piece of eye-candy. Did you seriously expect the creator of Buffy to just let his female characters stand around looking pretty? She kicks ass and how! (Yes, and it's about time!)2. For all the newbies out there that haven't watched some or all of the previous movies, the rest of the characters are thoroughly fleshed out. You get a long explanation about what they have been up to since their story last ended. So, it's possible that the first half may be a tad slow for the die-hard fans, but the second half more than makes up for it. Also, for what it's worth, isn't it better to know what the characters have been doing all this while, before they get down to some serious action?3. The post-credits scene. Oh My God! There is no point, whatsoever, in going to watch the movie if you don't wait for it. You simply HAVE to see it. 4. On a side-note, if you're relatively new to the Marvel universe, you must see The Superhero Squad Show (Yes, it's a cartoon, and no, it's not a very serious one either. But looking past all that, it's a serious refresher course in everything Marvel) before the next movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe releases, as it really helps you understand the characters. I wouldn't have understood the importance of the post- credits scene without it. 5. The fight sequences (the gist of which we all saw over and over again at Comic-Con!) finally makes it look like we are watching a superhero movie. It's not one until some old-fashioned ka-pow!6. And yes, there are many scenes which are a fanboy's (or girl's) most awesome-est dream come alive!You also, however, get the worst of Whedon, which I admit, I pretty much dreaded. I won't say what it is, as it will spoil it for you, but it's really very obvious if you've seen anything of Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Serenity and Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog (my opinion may not, however, be accurate, as some might argue that what we've seen is actually, his best) Whatever the general consensus, there is no doubt that Whedon gives his best shot at leaving his mark in the Marvel 'verse (!) and his best is pretty darn good!If I simply HAVE to find flaws in the movie, the only one I can think of right now is that some important Avengers - Ant-Man, Wasp, Black Panther and Vision - are nowhere to be seen. Black Widow was the only token female in this all-testosterone group, so Wasp would have been a welcome addition, as the scales would not be so unbalanced.The Avengers works because underneath all the larger-than-life heroes with their huge egos, their actions and emotions are just human enough to be believable. Things do not just fall in place - everybody does not magically get along with each other and fight away to glory - they had to work hard to make it happen. And that, is this movie's biggest USP.All-in-all, go watch the movie, if not on the first day, then at least some other time for as long as it's on in the theaters.

2012-04-16,"Yep, Marvel has done it again but this time to the max! You can rest assured that Avengers is an absolutely amazing movie. I'm so glad Marvel got in to the solo movie making business. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves and have not missed yet. (Sony pooping on Ghost Rider again this very year is a great reminder of that) Avengers is, without a doubt, their best effort yet! Personally, I think they set the bar leading up to this movie and they just clean blew the bar in to orbit with this movie.Avengers really takes the comic book genre to the highest level. They along with a select few others reinvented epic adventure as this century began by ""Marvelizing"" characters by making them more believable and more relatable. Spider-Man and the X-Men did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Nolan did this for Batman and Raimi for Spider-Man. They pulled it off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them. Favreau, Branagh and Johnston did similar good work for Marvel leading up to this gem. Now, Joss Whedon not only continues that tone but adds to the work that's come before. It's like the ultimate team work and Whedon brings it all home and all together perfectly. Like the great films of the past, he grounds the action and the superhero concept in firm reality. The humor and acknowledging the absurd nature of everything we see adds the perfect flavor. Yet, all the character depth and relationship nuances are fleshed out well as with any other good film.I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Avengers delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun. This is, without a doubt one of my top 10 movies of 2012, quite possibly THE best regardless of genre. I don't see anything changing that for the rest of the year.

2012-07-09,"As you well know by now, ""The Avengers"" is a large-scale superhero film that was four years in the making, with no less than four individual - yet inter-connected superhero films - feeding into this film's overall story. Joss ""Firefly"" Whedon was the director and co-writer on this highly ambitious project that is an adaptation of the Marvel Comics superhero team co-created by Stan Lee (who also appears in a very small cameo, like almost every other movie adaptation of a superhero he had a hand in creating) and the late Jack Kirby. Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Natasha Romanoff/The Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are the six misfits chosen by Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson) to defeat the traitorous Asgardian misfit Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his alien army from laying waste to New York City. And of course, six characters usually accustomed to working alone have to work out their differences and come together as a team to save the world. What gets ""The Avengers"" many points is that beside its big action sequences, fights and special effects, we never really lose sight of the characters (who are usually relegated to the background in a movie like this) and who they are. I liked that the movie actually spent time developing the individual characters so that we get to know them all over again - even though they've all already appeared in previous superhero films. It's all big superhero fun, with a knowing wink and an outstanding sense of humor that manages to elicit some strong laughs from anyone viewing this thing with an open mind. Sit back and enjoy!10/10P.S.: What happened to Dr. Henry ""Hank"" Pym/Giant-Man and Janet van Dyne/The Wasp? Weren't they part of the original Avengers team line-up (before ""The Avengers #4"" when Captain America became team leader, marking the character's Silver Age debut)?

2012-04-27,"This, friends, is the comic book movie that all other comic book movies wish they could be. It's the pinnacle, the ultimate, the surely unsurpassable achievement in its particular oeuvre, a grand adventure full of humor, action, tension, fan service and an undeniable pathos. For anyone fearing that all the hype – years and years worth of hype – might cheapen or otherwise overshadow the final outcome, you may at last be at ease. Because the JOSS WHEDON! AVENGERS MOVIE! is exactly as good as we all hoped it could be.Maybe even better.The Avengers, of course, are a superhero team made up of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Other heroes have come and gone amongst this happy few, in comic form, but here all you need to know is that this film serves as kind of a sequel to previous Marvel movies IRON MAN(both 1 and 2), THE INCREDIBLE HULK, THOR and CAPTAIN America, bringing the billionaire Tony Stark, the scientist Bruce Banner, the demigod Thor and the recently defrosted World War II veteran Steve Rogers together to fight against an invading alien threat, alongside spies Clint Barton (Jeremy Denner) and Natasha Romanov (Scarlett Johansson) and under the auspices of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.Man, it's awesome. AWE. SOME.Oh, it's by no means a perfect film. Whedon is perhaps just a shade too in love with S.H.I.E.L.D technology, and the weight of portent which is given to some truly innocuous lines – especially the final line – feels a little off-kilter. Flashing up a computer image of Natalie Portman's Jane (Thor's love interest from his movie) felt a little like an apology, and the shadowy government hacks who attempt to control Nick Fury are by-the-numbers backroom power players of the Cigarette Smoking Man-school, ruthless and annoyingly cliché.Everything else, though? Simply, outstandingly, without a shadow of a doubt incredible.Just for fun, let's talk acting. All our returning superheroes reprise their roles with ease, Downey Jr. once again a delight as the arrogant billionaire Stark and Evans stoic and earnest as the displaced Cap. The award for Most Improved has to go to Chris Hemsworth, whose Thor is given a chance to rock some deadpan wit here, and rock it he surprisingly does. Johansson, of course, is gorgeous and ass-kicking as ever in her Black Widow leather, but is happily also given new levels of intriguing backstory at which to hint and play out, and her friend Hawkeye is given somewhat more to do here than he was allowed in Thor, Jeremy Renner's relaxed performance once again worthy of my beloved marksman's bow and arrow. Clark Gregg's mild-mannered Agent Coulson is adorable in his hero worship; meanwhile our main antagonist in this film is Loki, Thor's resentful trickster brother once again played with consummate creepy cool by Tom Hiddleston.Oh, and hello again Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts! Aren't you funny and great?Of the newcomers, I will admit to having had some reservations about Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner, as I had been a true devotee of Edward Norton's turn in the role, but I am big enough to admit when I am wrong: he was terrific here as the mousey, mild-mannered science guy with a chip on his shoulder, and the uses to which his Hulk was put throughout the course of this movie have almost entirely changed my mind about his place in the Marvel Universe. It was that good. Elsewhere, How I Met Your Mother's Cobie Smulders, as an agent of S. H. I. E. L. D., did a lot with a little – enough to hope we see more of her lithe and loyal lieutenant character in AVENGERS 2.Indeed, after a rollicking, outrageous, hilarious outing like this one, who wouldn't already be eagerly awaiting a sequel? It is, unequivocally, the best comic book movie I have ever seen (and I've seen, well, all of them). More than that, it is my favorite movie so far this year – whew! I was so hoping BATTLESHIP wouldn't continue to hold that title for too much longer – and one I cannot wait to see again.Avengers assemble, they say? Audience assemble, I say!

2013-11-18,"This is an OK superhero flick featuring the Marvel Comics heroes Thor, Ironman, The Hulk, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow. They are assigned to protect the entire globe from Loki, the stepbrother of Thor, and an alien invasion.There are plenty of enjoyable action is this movie, helped with some slapstick humor. The action sequences, especially during the climax, were breathtaking and exciting, leaving the audience thoroughly entertained. However, the movie's main plot and story aren't very captivating or compelling, coupled with lack of chemistry and substance between the cast of characters.I would like to have seen every superhero in this movie given a more elaborative purpose and equal screen time; it appeared that Ironman was the main focus of the movie and took away most of the glory - too much emphasis was placed on the character. Robert Downey Jr. was too cocky and tried too hard to be funny in the Ironman role.Overall, this movie is just one battle scene after the other.

2012-07-01,"I saw The Avengers on May 17. Personally, I'm not much of a superhero fan, but I quite enjoyed the movie. In my opinion, The Avengers is a pretty good and entertaining movie, and it's a good theatrical experience. James Berardinelli wrote in his review, ""The Avengers kicks ass."" I agree.Over the last few years, five movies have been made - Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, and Captain America - which have built up to, and became prequels to, The Avengers. There were even things in those movies that hinted at them all being connected, and now this movie confirms it. The Avengers are all assembled in this film: Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, the Black Widow, and Hawkeye. Yes, they're all played by the same actors, and they have the backgrounds that have been established for most of them in the ""prequels"" mentioned above. The villain in the movie is Loki, who was the villain in Thor, and who now plans on using the Tesseract, a powerful energy cube, to open a portal to another part of the universe and attack the earth with a powerful army. The Avengers are called together by Nick Fury, who runs an agency called S. H. I. E. L. D., and they must stop Loki from carrying out his plans. There's more to the story, but I won't give any more away.I'm sure there are things that can be criticized about the movie. However, it's really not worth it, given there are so many good things about the movie, and the entire experience is very enjoyable, so I'm not going to bother with an in-depth review/criticism. In a way, the film is sort of critic-proof (for lack of a better term). So here's my advice: don't dissect or overly analyze the movie. Just sit back and enjoy it. That's not to say that it's a total Transformers-like junk movie or anything. It's actually halfway decent.The actors put on a good performance and really bring out their characters, and the interactions between the characters are good - the gathering of the different superheroes is handled pretty well. The story is pretty solid, and it's coherent and appropriately paced. The visual and special effects and action scenes are great. Alan Silvestri composed an effective score for the movie. Overall, the movie is halfway decent, it's smart, and it's entertaining, and, unlike many junk films like Michael Bay's, it actually allows for sufficient blockbuster emotional involvement, and it has a good, wise balance between story and action/effects. The two-and-a-half hour running length of the movie pretty much zipped by for me. So, while I don't think this movie is great, it's definitely entertaining and worth seeing, and it's a very good theater experience.My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)",9.0,2012-07,Sunday,"about:0.06, action:0.04, actors:0.08, actually:0.08, all:0.05, america:0.05, an:0.07, and:0.35, another:0.04, any:0.03, anything:0.04, are:0.13, army:0.05, at:0.02, avengers:0.12, away:0.05, back:0.04, be:0.02, been:0.06, being:0.04, better:0.03, between:0.08, black:0.03, blockbuster:0.05, bring:0.05, but:0.04, by:0.08, can:0.03, captain:0.05, characters:0.05, definitely:0.04, depth:0.05, different:0.04, don:0.06, earth:0.04, effects:0.06, enjoy:0.04, enjoyed:0.05, entertaining:0.12, entire:0.05, even:0.03, experience:0.14, fan:0.04, few:0.04, film:0.04, films:0.03, for:0.09, from:0.02, fury:0.04, give:0.04, given:0.05, going:0.04, good:0.17, great:0.05, half:0.05, has:0.02, have:0.08, hawkeye:0.03, here:0.04, his:0.06, hour:0.05, however:0.04, hulk:0.05, in:0.14, incredible:0.04, iron:0.07, is:0.12, it:0.21, just:0.02, last:0.04, like:0.05, loki:0.06, made:0.03, man:0.07, many:0.07, may:0.04, me:0.03, more:0.05, most:0.03, movie:0.20, movies:0.05, much:0.06, must:0.04, my:0.08, nick:0.04, not:0.08, now:0.07, of:0.11, on:0.06, opinion:0.05, or:0.05, out:0.08, over:0.03, overall:0.04, part:0.04, performance:0.05, played:0.05, pretty:0.16, put:0.04, quite:0.04, rating:0.05, re:0.04, really:0.05, review:0.09, same:0.04, saw:0.04, say:0.03, scenes:0.03, seeing:0.04, so:0.09, special:0.04, stop:0.05, story:0.08, superhero:0.03, superheroes:0.03, sure:0.04, tesseract:0.05, that:0.08, the:0.50, theater:0.05, their:0.03, them:0.06, there:0.10, they:0.07, things:0.13, think:0.03, this:0.05, thor:0.08, those:0.04, to:0.10, together:0.03, transformers:0.05, two:0.04, universe:0.05, up:0.03, very:0.06, villain:0.08, visual:0.05, was:0.02, way:0.03, well:0.03, were:0.03, which:0.03, while:0.04, who:0.08, widow:0.03, with:0.04, won:0.05, worth:0.09, years:0.04, yes:0.05"
2012-05-07,"Let's be honest. All the previous Marvel films leading to the Avengers were great - story wise, acting wise, effect wise etc. Iron Man I & II, Thor, Captain America all turned out to be (surprise) box office hits, and one can see the point. So, when at the end of every movie, a post credits scene was shown depicting that there is something even greater planned, the expectations were raised pretty high.Joss Whedon (Firefly, Cabin in the Woods) took into account that set expectations, of both comic book fans and non-fans alike, and put together a superhero flick that'll rest proudly as the conclusion to its predecessors. The screenplay writers, the VFX studio, the actors (Robert Downey Jr. has always been my favorite) all deserve credit.An action packed, blockbuster movie that already has every record broken and every voice cheering, The Avengers is one of the best movies this year.

Any other previous superhero movie I have seen was worse.If you never got into superhero comics then this is not a movie for you.Now back to the summary line. Some (sorry) idiotic reviewers are comparing this movie to: Memento, Blade Runner, Psycho, The Empire Strikes Back, The Matrix, etc. And talking about lack of symbolism, depth, twists, etc. ""This movie doesn't deserve this high rating, etc."" Are you people on drugs?Possible explanations for these 1 star ""punisher"" reviews are: 1 some people just love to hate or 2 they had a bad day or 3 they want to show off their ""expert"" knowledge of ""le cinema"" or 4 they were simply on drugs while watching this movieSo bad news guys: This movie does not have the hyper-realism of ""The Bicycle Thief"", the supreme intrigue of ""Citizen Kane"", the old fashion romance of ""Casablanca"", or the sublime dialogs of ""12 Angry Men"". This is only the best superhero movie I have ever seen.I am 50, I have an engineering degree, my favorite pastime is movies, my favorite genre is Sci-Fi, my favorite movie is Blade Runner and THIS IS STILL THE BEST SUPERHERO COMIC BOOK ADAPTATION I HAVE EVER SEEN (sorry for shouting) and this is why in my review this movie deserves a 9 (not 10 because it is not art).If you want to see an ""artsy"" movie check out ""The Bicycle Thief"" (and take some antidepressants with you).

2012-04-29,"The Avengers is quite possibly the most anticipated superhero movie in history, but does it quite live up to the hype?I know that this is the Marvel movie we have all been waiting for. This is the movie that all the others made by Marvel Studios has been leading up to. This is what they have been aching to show us.I was pleased to learn that I would be given the chance to see the movie before its May release date in the United States, but despite my privileged opportunity, I went in with relatively low expectations. (It's just another superhero movie, but with a bunch of them at one time, right?)Wrong...If you are a fan of Marvel, superheroes, great CGI or just all-around intense action films, you MUST see Marvel's The Avengers. The CGI was the best I've seen in a long time, the fighting as intense as ever, and the plot is top-notch. But these things aren't the only aspects of the movie that make The Avengers great. For me, it was the characters. Yes, we've seen all these characters before. We've enjoyed their specific movies, but having them on screen together worked better than I could have imagined. In fact, that was why I was apprehensive at first. I had been afraid that perhaps one hero would take away more screen time than another. (We all have our favorites.) But this wasn't the case. Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.), provided his much expected wit and humor for the film, causing the crowd to laugh on many occasions. The banter between Stark and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) flowed well and added a lot to the character depth. I wasn't sure how Thor (Chris Hemsworth) would be playing his part either. I thought he actually might be taking too much screen time from the others since his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), was the main antagonist, but this wasn't the case. I found myself most excited in the movie when Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) came on screen. His character was done so well for this movie. I found myself thrilled and even scared in some of his scenes.I must also mention here that Ruffalo did a superb job of taking Edward Norton's place as Bruce Banner/ The Hulk. If there's one thing that annoys me about sequels, it's when they change actors, but I actually enjoyed Ruffalo better in this role.Of course you can't forget about Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Each of them played their part of the story wonderfully, though I found Sam Jackson's acting to be a little stale.I would say that if you haven't watched the other movies made by Marvel Studios that you might want to watch them. Most references will be lost on you if you don't. As far as screen time, it felt like every character got their time in the light. No one person stole the show, and just as Marvel intended, they ALL stole the show.There is one particular scene that I enjoyed where the camera panned to each hero, doing their own special moves, though it's hard to explain further than that without giving anything away. However, there were moments in the movie where I had to lean over to my wife and ask what someone was talking about, but these instances were minor.Obviously, if you care anything about Marvel movies, you're already planning to see The Avengers. If you haven't seen any of the other Marvel Studios films, take a weekend, watch them. Then go see The Avengers.

2012-04-27,"I was eagerly waiting for this movie. But after seeing the Marvel movie, Captain America: the first Avenger, Thor and Incredible hulk- I thought that the movie would be not as good as the hype it carried for so many years. But still due to Robert downey jr. i wanted to see this film. OK, i admit it, i was blown away by the movie in terms of Action, and of course Humor. Director Joss Whedon, directed this movie so BRILLIANTLY, that there are very little or NO flaws. Sufficient Screen time has been provided for each of the SUPERHEROES. but the Mighty guys, Iron man(RDJ) and the Hulk(Mark Ruffalo) steal the show. Thor(Chris Hemsworth) was too, brilliant. In this movie, you'll see more of Captain America(Chris Evans) than his solo movie, which is really great. AND, Black Widow(Scarlett Johannson) kicks the ass off whoever she fights with. Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner) is not at all Underused, his Powers were shown superbly. Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) was great with his Initiative. And here it is, the main villain, Loki(Tom Hiddleston), steals the show with his mischievous and No-worries personality, he fits into the role perfectly. On the Whole, the cast were perfect, with each of them fitting into the characters with ease.The humor and witty one liners are splendid. Don't expect it to be DARK with no humor like the Dark knight, instead it wins the heart of each and every person watching the film in the auditorium. Many people have started comparing Avengers with The dark knight, but what I SAY is these two are COMPLETELY different type of film, and comparing the two is not justified. Still if you compare, Avengers is better than Dark knight. Due to the reason that Avengers can be enjoyed by each and every person, it has action and Humor, both at equal Quantities.As for iron man, Robert downey jr IS Iron man, no other person can do that role so perfectly. Unfortunately, RDJ is about to leave the franchise after IRON MAN 3, i request the iron man fans to please him not to leave the franchise for at least another 3 or 4 films, including AVENGERS 2. :)I will ensure to each and every person who is reading this that, this film will never disappoint you, not even a moment. 100%. :) Go watch it without doubt.

2012-12-08,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie I thought it looked pretty cool, and when the review started coming in I immediately got excited. When I finally got to see the movie I realized after the first 20 minutes that this wasn't the movie I was hoping for. Now let me explain why.I can start off with the script. The script is not good, by adding some over-dramatic, cheesy and boring dialogue doesn't make a movie good. But the script isn't terrible, some of the cheesy comments fits with the dialogue and makes you laugh a little. But the one thing that is directly terrible with this movie is the story. For those of you who don't know the story, it goes like this; Thor's evil brother Loki has come to the earth to claim it as his, and then he gets a thing called the Tesseract, and afters that he opens a portal so his alien army can enter the earth to take control over it. But then Nick Fury brings together the superhero team called ''The Avengers'' to stop him. I don't think it's necessary for me to start explaining why the story is so terrible, most people should understand why. And I know a lot of people have claimed that the film don't need a good script or story because it's so entertaining. Well, I don't agree. The first 1 and a half hours of the movie is really boring, and I actually considered leaving the cinema, but then the movie catch up with some really cool and visually stunning scenes. Some things in this movie was good, like most of the acting, the CGI and some of the dialogue.

2012-05-11,"Here's why ""The Avengers"" fails so badly.1. Wrong, wrong director - Joss Whedon is a TV Director. ""Serenity"" worked because it was essentially a TV movie. And he has here made ""The Avengers"" a TV movie. Bad move, this should have gone to J.J. Abrams, Bryan Singer or Brad Bird.2. Dreadful miscasting - only Robert Downey Junior can hold his head high. Chris Evans is as wooden in this as the flat ""Captain America"" film. Those playing Thor, Hulk, Black Widow either phone in performances or look embarrassed.3. Weak, weak villain - Tom Hiddleston plays a slight, camp character who offers little panache or interest and more closely resembles a spoiled teenager than anything else. This film needed a ""General Zod"".4. Too much obvious CGI - come on, it's 2012, there's no excuse for the George Lucas-y effects like the flying Shield craft graphics.5. No drama, tension and a script so obviously flat that Whedon inserts misplaced self conscious quips to lighten the tone.For anyone growing up with Marvel comics in the 70's (chime with me on this), we deserved SO much more. For younger audiences, it will pass I'm sure.Really can't understand though the positive reviews.

2012-04-30,"Action movies will now have a new leader as Avengers assemble by Marvel raises the bar to an entirely new level.The hype made by Marvel in 2011, by Introducing Thor and Captain America to the audience in quick succession just as a precursor for the Avengers ,is lived up and surpassed with what will be one of the beacons in modern era action movies.The boasted budget of $220m,is well spent for the movie expectedly satisfies you as a visual treat with what i think,one of the best CG effects.Also,this one does deserve a heads up to be watched in 3D, unlike annoyingly many in the recent past.Though,the first half has a few more than necessary scenes shot in the dark,but it gets better as the movie progresses.Though the plot is pretty straight-forward,there are so many characters in the movie to keep you entertained in their very own signature fashion.Each and every character is given nearly equal importance and nobody is left out,which is an effort to appreciate. They have really put a lot of efforts in the new Hulk to bring him up to join the party with others,and Boy! it does pay off exceptionally well.Iron Man's powers are tested to a very new level and being the most skilled avenger,they had to be.He has got some new moves, watch out for them!.I am really starting to like Captain America and the way he handles the situation. The time transitioned character of his, adjusts surprisingly quickly to the new scenario.Black Widow and Hawk-Eye who had brushing references in previous movies are full fledged avengers now, but i wish marvel to bring them up in singles.There are a few much needed subtle humorous moments exercising your jaws sideways in between a lot of fantastically choreographed action scenes keeping them dropped down for most of the time.Bout the cast, Downey Jr. undoubtedly stands out as an actor, with his amazing comic timing and the way he carries the arrogance of Iron-Man. The search for Bruce Banner has ended up giving the most subtle hulk yet,with Mark Ruffalo.The Rest of the cast looks just supportive. Cobie Smulders was supposed to be the eye candy,but Scarlett Johansson steals the show in that aspect, not to mention in her alter-ego superhero moves too.All in all, an awesome summer blockbuster with wholesome entertainment.

2012-07-12,"""Did anybody see Inception? I think that was just about the most ambitious movie I've ever seen. And then I thought wait a god damn second Marvel Studios is going to take all their top superheroes, and they're going to put them all together in The Avengers. That's the most ambitious movie I've ever seen!"" – Robert Downey Jr. (Comic Con 2010)It may have been the most ambitious movie ever but boy did they pull it off! There was always a small doubt that The Avengers (2012) may have been a flop for a couple of reasons. The first is the fact that the Captain America (2011) and Iron Man 2 (2010) were slightly lower than the standard of movies Marvel studios had shot out since 2008 when The Incredible Hulk (2008) hit the big screens. Obviously this lower standard must have been due to The Avengers being in production because the film topped my list of favourite films and became number 1, yes, it took over The Dark Knight (2008)!To read the full review go here: http://www.teknue.com/reviews/review- the-avengersavengers-assemble-2012/852",10.0,2012-07,Thursday,"2012:0.19, about:0.06, all:0.08, always:0.09, america:0.06, and:0.12, assemble:0.10, avengers:0.13, because:0.07, been:0.19, being:0.07, big:0.07, but:0.04, captain:0.06, comic:0.07, dark:0.09, did:0.14, downey:0.07, ever:0.21, fact:0.10, film:0.05, films:0.07, first:0.06, for:0.04, full:0.10, go:0.07, god:0.09, going:0.16, had:0.06, have:0.13, here:0.08, hulk:0.05, in:0.07, incredible:0.09, iron:0.05, is:0.06, it:0.09, jr:0.07, just:0.05, knight:0.10, man:0.05, marvel:0.11, may:0.19, most:0.19, movie:0.10, movies:0.05, must:0.08, my:0.05, of:0.09, off:0.08, out:0.05, over:0.07, put:0.09, re:0.09, read:0.11, review:0.20, reviews:0.11, robert:0.07, second:0.10, see:0.05, seen:0.14, since:0.09, superheroes:0.07, take:0.09, than:0.06, that:0.14, the:0.46, their:0.06, them:0.06, then:0.07, there:0.05, they:0.10, think:0.07, this:0.03, thought:0.09, to:0.12, together:0.06, top:0.09, ve:0.16, wait:0.10, was:0.08, were:0.06, when:0.06, yes:0.10"
2012-04-27,"From the moment Samuel L Jackson walked in during the post-credits scene of 'Iron Man' four years ago, talking about the 'Avengers Initiative', the whole world has waited for this epic assemblage of some of Marvel's greatest icons! Well, four years and five films later, the Avengers have finally assembled...and, as expected, it was with a wave of sheer awesomeness!Unlike the previous 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' films, 'The Avengers' isn't really into complex plotting here. The premise is simple-Loki, the Asgardian 'God', seeks to facilitate the invasion of Earth by an alien race...and Nick Fury, Director of SHIELD, responds by activating the 'Avengers Initiative', bringing together armored hero Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr. reprising the character for the third time), Loki's 'brother' and Asgardian warrior Thor (Chris Helmsworth), the living legend and man out of time Captain America (Chris Evans), gamma radiations expert Dr. Bruce Banner and his monstrous alter ego the 'Hulk' (both played to perfection by Mark Ruffalo, following in the footsteps of Edward Norton) and clandestine operatives Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). What follows is the usual hero vs. villain fare...albeit on a scale about a BILLION times larger than that of, say, 'Spiderman'. Indeed, one of the greatest moments in the film is a single shot that sweeps across New York City, taken in the battles of each of the six Avengers across the breadth of the Big Apple...a testament to the sheer scale and scope of not only the film itself, but the threat faced by the heroes in-universe.Action and spectacles aside, 'The Avengers' real strength lies in the characterizations of the core characters. Downey Jr. turns in another memorable performance as Tony Stark which was to be expected, and Tom Hiddleton brilliantly essays the megalomaniacal God Loki...but it is newcomer (to the Marvel movie-verse) Mark Ruffalo who really stands out in his dual performance as both scientific genius Bruce Banner and the rampaging Hulk. Ruffalo brings a level of depth to the character, and his inner struggles, which was not immediately evident in performances by previous actors. His Banner is not so much a man on the run from the monster within as he is a man who is starting to learn to accept the monster and use it as a force for good. Samuel L Jackson really gets to shine here as Nick Fury, after his cameos in previous films.On a parting note, there has been an unfortunate tendency, for months, on message boards, blogs and forums across the Internet, to create some kind of a 'competition' between The Avengers and Nolan's upcoming epic, The Dark Knight Rises. Having seen the former, I can safely say that such comparisons are totally uncalled for. The Avengers is not aiming to surpass The Dark Knight Rises any more than Star Wars was aiming to surpass The Godfather. They are two totally different films, belonging to different genres and (literally) whole different universes, and as fans, we need to respect that above all else and enjoy all masterpieces on their own merits!",10.0,2012-04,Friday,"about:0.05, action:0.02, actors:0.04, after:0.03, alien:0.04, all:0.03, america:0.03, an:0.05, and:0.25, another:0.04, any:0.03, are:0.04, as:0.13, avengers:0.15, banner:0.11, be:0.02, been:0.03, between:0.04, big:0.03, black:0.03, both:0.08, brings:0.05, brother:0.04, bruce:0.08, but:0.03, by:0.12, can:0.02, captain:0.03, character:0.05, characters:0.02, chris:0.07, cinematic:0.05, credits:0.05, dark:0.08, depth:0.05, different:0.12, director:0.04, downey:0.06, each:0.03, earth:0.04, else:0.05, enjoy:0.04, epic:0.09, evans:0.04, expected:0.09, fans:0.04, film:0.04, films:0.12, finally:0.04, for:0.08, four:0.10, from:0.04, fury:0.07, gets:0.04, god:0.08, good:0.02, greatest:0.10, has:0.05, have:0.02, having:0.04, hawkeye:0.03, he:0.03, here:0.07, hero:0.07, heroes:0.03, his:0.13, hulk:0.04, in:0.15, into:0.03, iron:0.05, is:0.11, isn:0.04, it:0.04, itself:0.05, jackson:0.08, jeremy:0.04, johansson:0.04, jr:0.06, kind:0.04, knight:0.09, loki:0.08, man:0.11, mark:0.06, marvel:0.07, moment:0.05, moments:0.04, more:0.02, movie:0.02, much:0.03, need:0.04, new:0.04, nick:0.07, norton:0.05, not:0.08, of:0.23, on:0.10, one:0.02, only:0.03, out:0.05, own:0.04, performance:0.09, performances:0.05, played:0.04, previous:0.12, real:0.04, really:0.08, renner:0.04, robert:0.03, ruffalo:0.09, samuel:0.08, say:0.06, scarlett:0.04, scene:0.04, seen:0.03, simple:0.05, single:0.05, so:0.02, some:0.05, star:0.04, stark:0.04, such:0.04, than:0.05, that:0.06, the:0.56, their:0.03, there:0.02, they:0.02, this:0.01, thor:0.02, time:0.05, times:0.04, to:0.19, together:0.03, tom:0.04, tony:0.04, two:0.04, universe:0.09, villain:0.04, was:0.07, we:0.03, well:0.02, what:0.02, which:0.06, who:0.05, whole:0.08, widow:0.03, with:0.02, world:0.03, years:0.07, york:0.05"
2012-05-21,"The Avengers – CATCH IT ( A+ ) The anticipation for the avenger's movie is undeniable. We have been waiting for this from years. To understand the Avenger's movie it's really important that you've seen all previous Ironman, the Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America's movies. As the avenger's give time to build characterizations for their heroes so getting into the avengers empty headed about hero's history will be foolish. The Avenger's brings back our beloved Marvel's heroes Tony Stark (Iron Man), Thor, Dr. Bruce Banner (Hulk), Steve Rogers (Captain America), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), Clint Barton (Hawkeye), Agent Maria Hill, Agent Phil Coulson and Director Nick Fury. Each hero's journey starts from where it ended in their respective movies. Now, The Avenger's stands strong in every department, from direction, production and performances. It won't be wrong to say that it brings out the best out of all the heroes. The humor, action and graphics are far brilliant than all the previous Marvel movies combined. The credit goes to generous brain of Joss Whedon. He brings out something very special out of each superhero. The interaction between all superheroes is something we don't see often, they tease, make fun and even fight with each other. Robert Downey Jr. (Ironman) is great as always. He brings his charming personality and wicked humor into his character which made him the superstar of today. Chris Hemsworth (Thor) is truly a god of thunder. His entry is as Big as Thor's entry should be, it makes you jump of your seat and cheer for him. Chris Evens (Captain America) is indeed the ultimate American Hero, he got the charm and personality of a true America hero. Some of the most standout moments in the movie belong to Mark Ruffalo (The Incredible Hulk). For the first time we see some humor in the actions of Hulk, he is just not a fury green monster this time around. besides Hulk, the biggest surprise is Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), we have seen the part of her in Ironman movie but this time around we completely understand the strength and wickedness of Black Widow. She is absolutely stunning and fantastic. Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) is good and I hope to see him someday with Black Widow. They had this amazing chemistry which requires further attention. Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders and Samuel L. Jackson the S.H.E.I.L.D are fun to watch. Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is superb, he was the ultimate villain and considering his brilliant performance in Thor, he has out done himself again. Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts) appearance is appreciated and I would have loved to see Natalie Portman (Jane Foster) in it too.

2012-04-27,"The Avengers (3D-2012) Movie Review-Ninaad Kothawade Director: - Joss Whedon Starring: - Robert Downey Jr. , Chris Hemmingsworth, Scarlett Johansson , Tom Hiddleston , Chris Evans , Mark Ruffalo , Samuel Jackson, Jeremy Renner 2 hour 22 minutesThe most Anticipated and Waited movie of the year 2012. This movie has high expectations from almost everyone Released on 27April Friday Six days before the US release. The Marvel superheroes Thor (Chris Hemsworth) Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) Captain America (Chris Evans) Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are assembled by the S.H.I.E.L.D. Leader Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) in order to prevent the expected war and fight the emerged Super Villain God of Mischief Loki (Tom Huddleston)! The Immortal Loki Planning a war and aiming Slavery on Earth, has to be defeated by this group of superheros called the Avengers. In order to achieve their target they have to Fight their Superhero Alter Ego and The clashes of their Ally's powers and control them to unify and Save the planet. Nick Fury convinces them all to join the Avengers Initiative ,which later leads to confusion brawl and Fights on the insideAll is taken lightly until the realization and attack on the Base which proves that the whole world is at stake. The Screenplay as well as the Storyline is Amazing, every scene handled with perfection. The Story is well explained and gives a break from the Action which keeps you In the Movie. The Cinematography is Awesome and Exceptional with the Direction and Special Effects Justifies the Storyboard and is Realistic...All the Action Sequences are well Coordinated, Engaging and with popping 3D effects well in place it's a treat to the eye. The Screen Space is shared equally and handled well between the Large Cast... About the Soundtrack it's Average, nothing Extraordinary or Provoking. The movie just misses out somewhere on the Emotions. The Previous releases have already made the Superheroes Familiar and this avoids much confusion. Well Edited and Brilliantly Adapted screenplay makes the most of the Storyline and even handles the major challenge that could have been faced of making Order of Chaos. The much Hyped movie has definitely met the expectations and is perfect blockbuster. Even watch it from some fresh Action from Hulk, Black Widow, and The Hawkeye who don't disappoint you at all. Mark Raffalo's performance and Character is noticeable out of all the other Star Superheroes. No doubt the best superhero movie this Decade. 3 time watch for Comic Superhero Movie fans. 2 time for Super Action Fans. And at least a onetime must watch for every other Hollywood Movie Buff out there.",7.0,2012-04,Friday,"2012:0.09, 3d:0.09, about:0.03, action:0.09, all:0.10, almost:0.05, already:0.05, amazing:0.04, america:0.03, and:0.32, are:0.04, as:0.04, at:0.08, avengers:0.06, awesome:0.04, be:0.02, been:0.03, before:0.04, best:0.03, between:0.04, black:0.07, blockbuster:0.05, by:0.05, captain:0.03, cast:0.04, character:0.03, chris:0.16, comic:0.03, could:0.03, definitely:0.05, director:0.04, don:0.03, downey:0.07, earth:0.04, effects:0.06, evans:0.08, even:0.06, every:0.07, everyone:0.04, expectations:0.10, expected:0.05, fans:0.08, fight:0.08, for:0.06, from:0.10, fury:0.08, god:0.05, group:0.05, has:0.08, have:0.06, hawkeye:0.07, hemsworth:0.04, hiddleston:0.04, high:0.04, hollywood:0.05, hour:0.05, hulk:0.05, in:0.07, incredible:0.04, iron:0.03, is:0.14, it:0.05, jackson:0.08, jeremy:0.09, johansson:0.08, joss:0.03, jr:0.07, just:0.02, least:0.05, loki:0.06, made:0.03, makes:0.04, making:0.04, man:0.02, mark:0.10, marvel:0.03, most:0.06, movie:0.15, much:0.06, must:0.04, nick:0.08, no:0.03, nothing:0.04, of:0.12, on:0.11, or:0.03, other:0.06, out:0.08, perfect:0.04, performance:0.05, place:0.05, powers:0.05, previous:0.05, renner:0.08, review:0.05, robert:0.07, ruffalo:0.07, samuel:0.08, save:0.05, scarlett:0.08, scene:0.04, screen:0.03, sequences:0.05, some:0.03, special:0.04, star:0.05, story:0.03, storyline:0.11, super:0.07, superhero:0.09, superheroes:0.11, that:0.04, the:0.58, their:0.08, them:0.06, there:0.03, they:0.02, this:0.06, thor:0.03, time:0.05, to:0.12, tom:0.08, until:0.05, us:0.05, villain:0.04, watch:0.09, well:0.16, whedon:0.03, which:0.09, who:0.03, whole:0.04, widow:0.07, with:0.06, world:0.04, year:0.05, you:0.04"

Actually I slept through some of it so there was SOME valuable time spent in the theater. I would have walked out except my girlfriend look like she was enjoying it. This movie just sucked, plain and simple. It's the typical good guys have to save the earth from aliens. It did have all the emotions though.....The dialog was laughable and the acting made me want to cry. Unless you just like seeing buildings getting demolished and people who are impervious to bullets, explosions, and every kind of weapon known to man, stay home and save your money.

2015-04-21,"The Avengers is a clean-burning, six-cylinder entertainment - a wall-to-wall action bonanza, executed with a fluid coherence. It laughs in the face of expectation and instead sets its own bar that all blockbusters need to follow.Following on from the first Thor flick, the demi-god's evil brother Loki (a deliciously fiendish Tom Hiddleston) is intent on subjugating humanity with the help of an all-powerful energy cube that'll allow him to bring his alien armies to Earth. Trouble starts when this glowing cube of untold power called the Tesseract is appropriated by Loki, who with a nudge from his magic assegai brain-zaps a snap marksman Hawkeye (a competent Jeremy Renner) and a top scientist into his evil scheme of world domination. All that stands in his way is Nick Fury (the ever reliable Samuel Jackson), the head of the covert peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D. who sets about uniting the world's superheroes to avert the threat, rounding up our titular team - Iron Man (a hilarious Robert Downey Jr.), The Hulk (a subversively charming Mark Ruffalo), Thor (the charismatic Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (a sincere turn by Chris Evans) and Black Widow (the sexy but earnest Scarlett Johansson) – hoping they will be greater than the sum of their parts. Problem is, they're a dysfunctional outfit, with differences of opinion and troubled pasts, and one of them is a gigantic, green loose cannon. Now, with a global catastrophe looming, they must subsume individual will to the collective good. But Loki isn't called 'the god of mischief' for nothing! Before Fury's new super team can find its balance, Loki is in their heads sowing seeds of doubt, distrust, anger and conflict. Can earth's mightiest heroes put their differences aside in time to protect the planet – or is their coming together an even bigger threat than Loki himself?The Avengers doesn't buckle under the weight of its gargantuan expectations and overflowing cast, largely because of Joss Whedon. He weaves all of the powder-keg moments into a story that is meaningful and always makes sense. The point in The Avengers is to bring six separate characters together as a team without sacrificing their individuality and by extension their value as solo franchises and Whedon does an excellent job of keeping the disparate personalities of his protagonists in play. Whedon's script sparks up the exposition with some sparkling dialogue, high stakes and balls- to-the-wall action spectacle. If you don't believe me, check out the thrilling alien-bashing finale on the streets of Manhattan - it is a pure fan boy wet-dream. Smart, funny, pulsating and surprisingly cathartic, Joss Whedon succeeds in appeasing its core fanbase. From ambition to scale to the way it justly balances each remarkable character, The Avengers is utterly stimulating, satisfyingly scripted and damn right faultless big screen entertainment. The Avengers make us do something increasingly rare in these over-franchised times - root for a sequel.

2012-05-06,"I know there's comic book fans that have their favorites. There's also the film fans that have their own favorites. There are also some who are so enamored and in love with The Dark Knight that they will pounce on any film that is considered ""better"". For me, I've never been a big comic book guy but I do enjoy a good film adaptation of them. I can love The Dark Knight AND Iron Man. I don't have a bias. I enjoy several of these type of films regardless of the company, brand, or filmmaker. For me, I absolutely love The Avengers. It brought out the little kid in me. At 33, cynical and disgruntled, that's a major compliment. I understand that the film is by no means perfect but it was just so much damn fun. It made me want to buy a costume and play make believe in the backyard again. But again, I'm 33, so I mean that figuratively. I just really had a blast with this and this is the best theater experience I've had since seeing a Star Wars movie. I loved it and can't wait to see it again. So, for those who have hang-ups about how you don't want to hear its better or more popular than this or that, don't get caught up in that nonsense. Who cares where people rank The Avengers or Iron Man or The Dark Knight or what have you? It doesn't matter. So, just do yourselves the favor of seeing this movie.

2012-05-13,"This film is not only spectacular but its an ""historic"" superhero feature film at its best. This is worth the wait. Hell, this was worth the wait 7 years ago when it was first developed. Do we really think this will be in development hell? This is The Avengers ""EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES!"" This is something what has NEVER been done before & Marvel has got there finger on the pulse. In 1998, a minor marvel character featuring a human/vampire hybrid made it way to the big screen. In 2000, a group of mutants evolved into the box office. In 2002, was the year of the Spider.After Daredevil, Hulk (Ang Lee), The Punisher, Elektra, Man-Thing, Fantastic Four & Ghost Rider, Marvel Studios would start producing its own films and distribute them through Paramount Pictures & the funding will come from a seven-year, $525 million revolving credit facility with Merrill Lynch. The result led to the creation of the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"". Sounds cool, right? It was. No, really, It F***in' was. Iron Man made its motion picture debut, The Hulk got rebooted, Thor & Captain America have ""FINALLY"" got the Big screen treatment. Then came a huge shift in the Marvel universe.... Marvel Entertainment is now owned by Mickey Mouse.Amazing. Disney let go the Power Rangers franchise & bought Marvel.But after everything from comics to TV & film Marvel has put out it comes to show just how far they come as a company & knowing the fact that the biggest supporters (including me) are the fans. That is why they CAN NOT Disappoint us. Yeah, we complain about story lines, costumes & special effects, But if they stay true to the comics, the films would have done its justice. But i know deep down, Marvel Studios will always put out films & stay close to the material. So, what i've said earlier, was it worth the wait? Yes. Yes it was ""definitely"" worth it.Marvel Studios, the cast & crew of The Avengers did an amazing job & on the Marvel Cinematic Universe & i can't wait to see what comes next.Now if DC & Warner Bros. step their game up, we would like to see the Justice League into the big screen.",10.0,2012-05,Sunday,"about:0.03, after:0.08, always:0.05, amazing:0.08, america:0.03, an:0.06, and:0.02, are:0.02, as:0.02, at:0.03, avengers:0.05, be:0.02, been:0.04, before:0.04, best:0.03, big:0.12, biggest:0.06, but:0.08, by:0.03, came:0.05, can:0.06, captain:0.03, cast:0.04, character:0.03, cinematic:0.12, come:0.08, comes:0.10, comics:0.10, cool:0.05, definitely:0.05, development:0.05, did:0.04, do:0.04, done:0.09, down:0.05, earth:0.05, effects:0.04, entertainment:0.06, everything:0.05, fact:0.05, fans:0.05, fantastic:0.05, far:0.05, film:0.08, films:0.11, finally:0.05, first:0.03, four:0.06, franchise:0.06, from:0.05, go:0.04, got:0.15, group:0.06, has:0.09, have:0.05, heroes:0.04, how:0.04, huge:0.05, hulk:0.05, if:0.06, in:0.11, into:0.07, iron:0.03, is:0.11, it:0.14, its:0.19, job:0.05, just:0.03, know:0.04, let:0.05, like:0.03, lines:0.05, made:0.07, man:0.06, marvel:0.32, me:0.03, never:0.04, next:0.05, no:0.03, not:0.05, now:0.08, of:0.07, on:0.05, only:0.03, out:0.06, own:0.05, power:0.06, put:0.10, really:0.06, right:0.05, said:0.05, screen:0.12, see:0.06, show:0.05, so:0.03, something:0.04, special:0.04, spectacular:0.06, start:0.05, story:0.03, superhero:0.03, that:0.04, the:0.46, their:0.03, them:0.03, then:0.04, there:0.03, they:0.08, thing:0.05, think:0.04, this:0.11, thor:0.03, through:0.05, to:0.14, true:0.06, universe:0.16, up:0.03, us:0.05, ve:0.04, wait:0.22, was:0.15, way:0.04, we:0.11, what:0.09, when:0.03, why:0.05, will:0.09, with:0.02, worth:0.20, would:0.10, year:0.10, years:0.05, yes:0.11"
2013-06-04,"Before I say everything that was wrong with the movie, I will first say that I am familiar with the comics and source material, and have thought all the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies so far were decent. My personal favorite is Ironman 1, one of my favorite movies overall, because of the way it told the story and how it maintained more realism than the other movies in the franchise series of Marvel movies. Physics, engineering, and basic foundations of life were followed while telling the story of Tony Stark. Everything, while elaborate, seemed possible. Possible is the key word.I grew up watching Bill Bixby be the Incredible Hulk with Lou and thought the show was awesome. I do know, though, that technology wasn't around the make Hulk be what the comic wanted him to be. The Hulk movie therefore was decent but nothing I am dying to watch again. Captain America and Thor were decent too.So what was I expecting when I saw Avengers? I was expecting the 1992 Dream Team. I was expecting a movie that would be epic in every way where each character was maximized to their fullest while trying to solve a deep plot similar to The Watchmen or even the recent Dark Knight Trilogy. I got neither. The plot, in my opinion, was way too simplified and even worse, all the characters seemed to be more forgettable.I will say some of the casting was quite poor and didn't flow with the original intent of the characters and some were just annoying in their roles. Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner, in particular, were very unwatchable even though like Lost in Translation and The Hurt Locker.Overall, I can see how this movie made so much money. It is the perfect movie to take younger kids and comic book fans. It is actually even better for those that don't know the source material because they are coming into the movie fresh. However, this is no Dark Knight type of movie with the depth of plot, real-world story lines, or the perfect casting.

I watched it yesterday night at the South Delhi PVR Priya Cinema Hall (3D; hated their scratchy defective glasses which needed changing for many people).The first half was just okay (actually even boring) and the intermission point was so ill-timed and then the second half was good. The fight scenes in the city (Manhattan) are like the latest Transformers. A one time watch for sure; but don't expect much. I liked the film but not as much as I had expected it to like! There are many enthralling scenes but the number of boring frames (particularly in the first half) is also abundant. The villain is not so menacing or dignified (like the all-powerful villain of X-Men 3). He needed more teeth. And I am not alone in thinking so; five of my friends with me have similar opinion.

2012-05-14,"Loved this movie, even at almost 3 hours long it didn't drag.

Every one of the superheroes gets their moment in the sun. And of course, there's Scarlett's character Black Widow. YUM! I'm giving the movie 10/10 (2D HD version) because it's so entertaining and it fulfilled all my expectations. You won't be disappointed.As far as the format goes though, stick with HD, there wasn't any real 3D moments. If you are hugely into your 3D experience, think twice before paying the extra, there wasn't any stand out 3D moments, but lots of out of focus backgrounds which kinda wasted the small fortune that must have been spent on production.

2012-05-12,"I'll admit it, I was extremely doubtful about this film. I've loved Joss Whedon's work my entire life and I had enjoyed all the previous Marvel films that led up to this one, especially Iron Man. But the fact that they brought together all of these different characters from all these different movies and put them together in 2 1/2 hour film was unprecedented and almost seemed impossible. But the optimist in me got me to the theater with me expectations shaky. Once the film started I was quickly drawn in and once the title appeared on the screen I knew that Joss Whedon had done it. The Avengers is without a doubt my favorite Marvel film and even my favorite action film ever made. Whedon did a great job writing this masterful, witty script that ingeniously put together all these characters and made it flow perfectly. The actors did such a great job playing these characters again and it didn't seem like anyone was underutilized and everyone got a chance to be in the spotlight(especially the hulk). Once you see all of the characters assemble and fight the bad guys you can't help but fill with happiness. The entire movie was such a fun thrill ride from the beginning to the end and the ending battle scene was brilliantly done.

2012-05-01,"As AWESOME as expected. An immense lineup/casting, decent story and visuals that put Transformers blur to shame. Iron Man does take a fair chunk of the limelight, as expected (It felt like this was his third film, before that has even been released) but the others do get their fair share and have great entrances.Oh..the movie is very funny!! Iron man starts off initially, but Hulk sees to it, that he gets the last laugh.. and his latter scenes do dominate the tail end (Mark Ruffalo does a pretty decent job) Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye (seen briefly in Thor) makes Oliver's Green Arrow from DC, look pathetic. This movie along with his role in Mission Impossible 4 is definitely a precursor to his taking over the role as Bourne, and he's pumping up for that too.Speaking of the muscles in the film. ""Cap"" appears to have lost weight?? Chris Evans must not be working out as much, but Thor seems to have taken over in the gym as he's even bigger. Hulk is obviously the biggest but thats what CGI does for you.. Oh, and Iron Man appears bulkier?? like his suit needs to compete??! Scarlett Johannsson's ass get's a cameo in this film, I wonder how she felt about the camera's angle in all the 3D glory in one scene..Another new member to the cast, and good to see another Avenger's regular ~ Agent ""Maria Hill"" appears, played by a very fit looking Cobie Smulders (Robin from ""How I met your mother"" fame) She gets a fair chunk of the movie and action herself. Stellan Skarsgaard returns from Thor along with the villain most would have seen in the trailer, Loki. Potts & Coulson cameo.The ""one on one"" battles of many of the heroes is a sight to behold and are really a delight to watch. You get to see them throw everything at each other as you see them match up their strengths and their weaknesses. Also watch for the Cap / Iron Man combo towards the end of the film, memories from the past! Loved the film. Will no doubt be seeing it again..

2012-05-06,"It was a surprise that I actually liked Marvel's The Avengers. My expectations were a film about a bunch of superheroes exercising their powers for the sheer amusement of the comic-book fans. Indeed, I was right about the exercise of power (naturally enough) but the way such showing-off was employed is what I like about the film. While, on the surface the events may seem to revolve about a group of mentally immature superheroes, there are several references to a deeper meaning, presented in a hilarious, light way with focus on both action and dialogue alike.The undertone found in The Avengers has to do with the current universal trend of freedom and rebels. Loki makes it clear that his purpose is to fix the 'problem' which earth inhabitants have of misunderstanding the meaning of 'freedom' claiming they 'are made to be ruled'. Also, there is an indirect mention of fallen regimes, in general, and particularly the fall of the Soviet Union. Though this subject is not dealt with depth, it gives some weight to the light nature of the film. A film about superheroes is not expected to tackle serious issues but, at the same time, films whose main aim is to entertain the viewer should still not be an embodiment of triviality as is the case in many comedies of the last few years.This is delivered through a balance between action and dialogue. The film is action-packed like a superhero film should be, though this does not come at the expense of dialogue; action sequences are supported by the amazing CGI (with a special nod to the resemblance between Dr Banner and the Hulk). Dialogue, similarly, plays an important role in the development of events and the relationship between the characters.Wittily, this is coated with a fair amount of good humour. Though some jokes could be predictable, the spontaneity of the performances makes them, unarguably, funny. For example, towards the end, when Rogers is giving orders to policemen, what follows is pretty predictable but the spontaneity of the policeman made viewers laugh despite themselves. Non-verbal humour even mounts to a point when viewers clapped hard – when Dr Banner's 'other guy'shut Loki up with a slight movement of his huge arms.Such elements gather, in the end, to make a film that, successfully, transcends the circle of comic-book fans, delivering one of the best films of the season.",7.0,2012-05,Sunday,"about:0.15, action:0.09, actually:0.05, also:0.03, amazing:0.04, amount:0.06, an:0.08, and:0.09, are:0.07, as:0.02, at:0.05, avengers:0.04, banner:0.08, be:0.09, best:0.03, between:0.13, book:0.08, both:0.05, but:0.06, by:0.03, cgi:0.05, characters:0.03, come:0.04, comic:0.07, could:0.04, depth:0.06, development:0.05, dialogue:0.21, do:0.04, does:0.04, earth:0.04, end:0.08, enough:0.04, even:0.03, expectations:0.05, expected:0.05, fans:0.09, few:0.04, film:0.18, films:0.07, for:0.04, found:0.06, funny:0.04, giving:0.06, good:0.03, group:0.05, guy:0.05, hard:0.05, has:0.03, have:0.02, his:0.06, huge:0.05, hulk:0.03, humour:0.12, in:0.11, is:0.20, it:0.05, last:0.05, like:0.05, liked:0.05, loki:0.06, made:0.07, main:0.05, make:0.04, makes:0.08, many:0.04, marvel:0.03, may:0.05, my:0.03, not:0.09, of:0.34, off:0.04, on:0.05, one:0.02, other:0.03, packed:0.05, performances:0.05, point:0.05, power:0.05, powers:0.06, pretty:0.05, right:0.04, role:0.05, same:0.04, seem:0.06, sequences:0.05, serious:0.06, should:0.08, some:0.06, special:0.04, still:0.04, such:0.09, superhero:0.03, superheroes:0.11, that:0.06, the:0.57, their:0.03, them:0.03, there:0.05, they:0.03, this:0.07, though:0.13, through:0.05, time:0.03, to:0.19, up:0.03, was:0.06, way:0.07, were:0.03, what:0.06, when:0.09, which:0.03, while:0.04, with:0.12, years:0.04"
2012-09-30,"I was drawn into watching this movie by the promising graphics more than anything else. I'm not a comic book aficionado in the least, so I went into the movie without any of that background knowledge. Nor did I need it, as I soon found out. There's enough back story inserted to get folks through & the back story of the characters isn't really integral to the story, I thought.The plot was VERY predictable. There was nothing new or original about it. Can easily see where the story is heading and pretty easy to guess how it will end. So, in that regard, I'd give the movie a 1 out of 10.Where this film shines -- and is downright amazing -- are the majority of the graphics. Fantastically intricate CGI work! From that aspect, I'd give the movie a 9 out of 10.So, basically, this is a great one if you're looking for mindless entertainment as the story line isn't a challenge to follow.

2012-04-28,"I can not say anything more about THE AVENGERS; the movie just hit all the right spots and a lot more. It didn't only entertain like how a brainless popcorn movie would; it told a great superhero team story.The characters were written perfectly, the action was spectacular and best of all ever character was a joy to watch. The story had the perfect balance of comedy, action and drama (yes, there's a bit of that too and it's good). It's everything a comic book fan would want out of a comic book adaptation movie.Every member of the Avengers line-up (whether super powered or not) got the right amount of screen time; if you were like me and thought that Iron Man would get accidentally hog the screen because the trailers made the movie look like ""IRON MAN AND FRIENDS,"" your fears will be washed away. Mark Ruffalo also stole the show as Banner/ The Hulk; if you had a few doubts about him playing the character after Edward Norton was left behind, fear not since he does the job well. I can go as far as saying that Ruffalo is the best incarnation of Banner so far. Josh Whedon pulled off the impossible; he wrote and directed a perfect comic book adaptation. He created what I consider the best superhero movie so far. He made THE AVENGERS.To say anything more would be a waste of time.

2012-06-30,"This film is is an empty shell covered with dazzling lights. Sure, it does look pretty but that is as far as it goes.Nothing interesting happens in this film (by interesting I mean plot wise, not a standard fight scene with new people copied and pasted into it) the 'plot' is horrific, to the point in which you wonder if there actually is a one. Hollywood seem to use the same script for every action film they make, only they replace a few of the more minor details so hopefully people won't notice. In an attempt to keep at least some of the male (and select female) audience awake the director decides it is time for Scarlett Johansson to pop up on screen to show off her, lets say defining costume in such an obvious manner. It is just a cheap, cheap film full of filler material that you will enjoy if you have an inability to think for yourself.I really have no idea how this film got into the top 100 of all time, there is really no reason for it to be there.

2012-04-27,"""Amazing"", would be a one word review for this movie!I went on to the cinema yesterday and was excited enough to have watched the trailers more than 30 to 40 times and was thinking, how would Marvel / Joss Whedon contain any of these characters in such a short story (last for about 142 min) when each of them were brilliant enough to grip me in 130-150 minutes of their own (in Iron Man 1 & 2, Thor, Captain America). But Mr. Whedon knew what he wanted from the story and has clearly demarcated his territory.This has to be the best superhero movie till date. Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man / Stark) has been ecstatic in his own witty and superb dialogue delivery, Chris Hemsworth (Thor) is, well, strong and manly, Chris Evans (Captain America) has acted like a true captain specially at the latter part of the movie and between all the action and a surprise, Hulk has smashed everything and has been fun too, for a delightful change. I really think Mark Ruffalo (The Hulk) is the key ingredient which would make people jump on their seats and has added to the fun and excitement to this amazing roller coaster of a movie.I delightfully give this a 10 out of 10 (I hope there was a 11 possible) for allowing me to witness a 2 and a half hour roller coaster, without a break!!!Watch it, if you want to know how Superhero movies should be!",10.0,2012-04,Friday,"10:0.13, about:0.05, action:0.04, all:0.03, amazing:0.13, america:0.10, and:0.28, any:0.06, at:0.04, be:0.12, been:0.11, best:0.05, between:0.07, brilliant:0.09, but:0.03, captain:0.15, characters:0.04, chris:0.14, cinema:0.09, dialogue:0.09, downey:0.06, each:0.06, enough:0.15, evans:0.07, everything:0.07, for:0.13, from:0.04, fun:0.13, give:0.07, half:0.09, has:0.32, have:0.04, he:0.05, hemsworth:0.07, his:0.10, hope:0.09, hour:0.10, how:0.12, hulk:0.08, if:0.05, in:0.12, iron:0.09, is:0.06, it:0.03, joss:0.06, jr:0.06, know:0.07, last:0.08, like:0.04, make:0.06, man:0.09, mark:0.06, marvel:0.05, me:0.10, minutes:0.09, more:0.05, movie:0.12, movies:0.05, of:0.16, on:0.08, one:0.04, out:0.05, own:0.15, part:0.08, people:0.06, really:0.05, review:0.09, robert:0.06, ruffalo:0.06, short:0.09, should:0.07, stark:0.07, story:0.10, such:0.07, superhero:0.11, than:0.05, the:0.25, their:0.10, them:0.05, there:0.05, these:0.06, think:0.06, this:0.11, thor:0.09, times:0.08, to:0.24, too:0.06, true:0.09, want:0.07, was:0.10, watch:0.05, watched:0.08, well:0.05, went:0.09, were:0.05, what:0.05, whedon:0.11, when:0.05, which:0.06, without:0.07, witty:0.09, would:0.16, you:0.04"
2012-04-26,"I have to say this movie was out of this world. Exactly what any big fan of comics or of all the marvel movies wanted. There was just enough of every character involved. I know a large debate can be had on the characters not being like they are in the comics or the plots being different but behind it all they cant just make a really long boring movie with every detail involved!! Its definitely not a movie for the person who doesn't like the previous movies. The acting of Robert Downey Jr was brilliant and the addition of the new hulk Mark Ruffalo was even better. It could been debated that Ed Norton would of been better but if you ask me personally the new hulk was outstanding! The movie experience in 3D was also very good. I am not a huge fan of 3D movies from the past, but after watching the avengers, marvel did a great job in all the action scenes where they took full use of the 3D effects.

2012-04-29,"This is a good film but the current overall IMDb score of 8.9 is rather high.Put simply its entertaining and fun. However the problem inherent in the film is how to fit so many larger than life characters into one story and give them equal screen time. Whedon manages to do it but as a result i feel the story had to fit the characters rather than the characters fit the story. There are a lot of new character relationships that have to be established. It gets a little bit convoluted trying to keep up with itself.The threat facing the avengers, i.e Loki and his rather randomly sourced army, just seems a bit cobbled together. Especially the army! Where they came from or what they are doesn't seem properly explained. Just that Loki somehow has one. The threat the Avengers face seems more to do with sheer numbers of bad guys rather than any particularly interesting powerful individual villains. Loki on his own just doesn't seem that threatening. He is wonderfully without remorse though. Bitter and twisted by his quest for revenge. One of his scenes with black widow is almost like Hannibal Lector and Clarice in Silence of the Lambs.Black widow for my money is the most entertaining and interesting character in the film. Maybe its because she doesn't actually have any super powers that makes her so. What she does have is an exceptional mind, attitude and rather scary hand to hand combat skills. Played wonderfully by Scarlet Johannson she is a pleasure in practically every scene.One of the other pleasurable things about this film is the occasionally very funny dialogue and scenes. Whedon is a master of witty fast paced exchanges and he doesn't disappoint here. The cinema audience laughed hard many times. The Hulk having the two biggest laughs in the film.This is a decent film which could have went horribly wrong. A lot of lead characters vying for screen time is a problem. Time spent establishing new relationships also. Perhaps the next one will be more compelling? The film isn't overly subtle but then what did i expect given the nature of its premise!?",7.0,2012-04,Sunday,"about:0.03, actually:0.05, almost:0.05, also:0.04, an:0.03, and:0.15, any:0.08, are:0.05, army:0.11, as:0.02, audience:0.06, avengers:0.05, bad:0.05, be:0.05, because:0.04, biggest:0.06, bit:0.10, black:0.08, but:0.07, by:0.06, came:0.06, character:0.07, characters:0.11, cinema:0.06, could:0.04, dialogue:0.06, did:0.04, do:0.08, does:0.04, doesn:0.20, entertaining:0.10, especially:0.05, every:0.04, expect:0.06, face:0.06, feel:0.05, film:0.19, for:0.06, from:0.03, fun:0.04, funny:0.05, gets:0.05, give:0.05, given:0.06, good:0.03, guys:0.06, had:0.04, hard:0.05, has:0.03, have:0.10, having:0.06, he:0.06, her:0.06, here:0.05, high:0.05, his:0.13, how:0.04, however:0.05, hulk:0.03, imdb:0.07, in:0.10, individual:0.06, interesting:0.11, into:0.04, is:0.22, isn:0.05, it:0.04, its:0.12, itself:0.06, just:0.09, keep:0.06, life:0.05, like:0.03, little:0.05, loki:0.10, lot:0.09, makes:0.04, many:0.08, maybe:0.06, mind:0.06, money:0.06, more:0.06, most:0.04, my:0.03, new:0.09, next:0.06, of:0.16, on:0.03, one:0.12, or:0.03, other:0.03, overall:0.05, own:0.05, played:0.06, powers:0.06, put:0.05, rather:0.32, scene:0.05, scenes:0.08, screen:0.08, seem:0.13, seems:0.12, she:0.18, simply:0.06, so:0.06, story:0.10, super:0.04, than:0.10, that:0.08, the:0.40, them:0.03, then:0.04, there:0.03, they:0.06, things:0.05, this:0.06, though:0.05, time:0.09, times:0.05, to:0.12, together:0.03, two:0.05, up:0.03, very:0.03, went:0.06, what:0.09, whedon:0.07, where:0.04, which:0.04, widow:0.08, will:0.03, with:0.07, without:0.05, witty:0.06, wrong:0.06"

2012-06-29,"Oh my god ! .. The Avengers was a big disappointment to me ! I can't believe how doll and bored I was during the 2 hours and 20 minutes playtime of the movie ..The directing was so bad and I think the director thinks the audience are so stupid or retarded to believe those cheap story lines or cheap jokes or even cheap plot .. The script was so cheap and boring and the characters didn't blend with each other at all ..I'm not even impressed by the special effects of the movie .. I think X-Men 3 or Spider Man showed a lot more special effect than this one .. I nearly enjoyed the last scene of the entire movie but this was not enough for such a movie who earned unbelievable high ratings ..Finally, when I knew that the director has never directed such super hero movies and he has only directed for the TV (like Buffy series), I know why this movie sucked !! still can't believe how it got 8.6 really !!",5.0,2012-06,Friday,"all:0.04, and:0.19, are:0.05, at:0.05, audience:0.10, avengers:0.04, bad:0.08, believe:0.32, big:0.08, boring:0.11, but:0.04, by:0.06, can:0.11, characters:0.05, didn:0.08, director:0.17, each:0.07, effects:0.07, enjoyed:0.10, enough:0.09, entire:0.11, even:0.13, finally:0.10, for:0.08, god:0.10, got:0.09, has:0.11, he:0.06, hero:0.08, high:0.10, hours:0.11, how:0.14, it:0.03, know:0.08, last:0.09, like:0.05, lines:0.10, lot:0.08, man:0.05, me:0.06, minutes:0.11, more:0.06, movie:0.18, movies:0.05, my:0.06, never:0.08, not:0.09, of:0.10, one:0.05, only:0.07, or:0.23, other:0.06, plot:0.08, really:0.06, scene:0.09, script:0.10, series:0.11, so:0.15, special:0.16, still:0.08, story:0.06, such:0.18, super:0.08, than:0.06, that:0.04, the:0.42, think:0.15, this:0.10, those:0.09, to:0.06, was:0.21, when:0.06, who:0.06, why:0.09, with:0.04"
2015-04-11,"The avengers is a classic marvel movie full of action, stunning special effects and the odd bit of funny humour. I think Age of Ultron will be better but this is still a fun and enjoyable film. I love how it appeals to everyone not just comic book fans. I can't find any flaws in this movie , it kinda has everything you need in a good movie:action, comedy, cool quotes and stunning special effects. I also love how marvel did movies before this one so the characters could be developed. The casting choices were also great. Everyone fits perfectly as the character they were chosen to play. Robert Downey Jr is great as Iron Man and Scarlett Johannson is amazing as Black Widow. My favourite is Samuel L Jackson as the tough but amazing Nick Fury.

2012-04-15,"The Avengers has been in development for years. Ever since I saw Iron Man for the first time and saw that after credits sequence for the first time, I knew something huge was about to happen. Now four years later, it is finally happening. Marvel brought together Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye to form the Avengers. The film is written and directed by Joss Whedon who is known to be a legend with TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly, Angel, and Dollhouse. Now this has been my most anticipated film of 2012 for a long time and every trailer has gotten me more pumped than the previous one. Well, I finally saw it at the New York IMAX 3D fan screening (one of 10 that was being held across the country) and I have to say that I may make some bold statements in this review, but I fully believe in them. The Avengers is gonna be a really tough film to beat for not just the best superhero film of the year, but the best film of the year in general.I really have nothing but praise for The Avengers. It's everything that I wanted it to be and more. After four years of following Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America, Marvel and Joss Whedon brought everything full circle for whats sure to be a critical and financial success. It's funny, emotional, a visual spectacle, and just everything that makes a perfect superhero movie. I cannot wait to go see it again on May 4th.Overall, I give The Avengers an A+",10.0,2012-04,Sunday,"10:0.06, 2012:0.07, 3d:0.07, about:0.04, after:0.10, again:0.06, america:0.08, an:0.04, and:0.24, at:0.04, avengers:0.15, be:0.13, been:0.09, being:0.05, believe:0.07, best:0.08, black:0.05, brought:0.15, but:0.08, by:0.04, captain:0.08, credits:0.08, development:0.07, ever:0.05, every:0.05, everything:0.18, fan:0.06, film:0.17, finally:0.14, first:0.09, for:0.19, four:0.17, full:0.07, funny:0.06, give:0.06, go:0.05, has:0.11, have:0.06, hawkeye:0.05, huge:0.07, hulk:0.07, in:0.10, incredible:0.12, iron:0.11, is:0.09, it:0.14, joss:0.09, just:0.07, like:0.04, long:0.06, make:0.05, makes:0.06, man:0.11, marvel:0.08, may:0.14, me:0.04, more:0.08, most:0.05, movie:0.03, my:0.04, new:0.06, not:0.03, nothing:0.06, now:0.11, of:0.11, on:0.03, one:0.06, overall:0.07, perfect:0.06, previous:0.07, really:0.08, review:0.07, saw:0.20, say:0.05, see:0.04, since:0.06, some:0.04, something:0.06, superhero:0.09, sure:0.06, than:0.04, that:0.13, the:0.38, them:0.04, this:0.05, thor:0.08, time:0.12, to:0.18, together:0.04, visual:0.07, wait:0.07, was:0.06, well:0.04, whedon:0.09, who:0.04, widow:0.05, with:0.03, written:0.08, year:0.14, years:0.18, york:0.08"
2012-12-24,"The danger with every superhero movie is that it will end up either horrifically unrealistic or unappealing to anyone over the age of ten. I am pleased to say that 'The Avengers' does not fall into either of these pitholes - in fact, it has to be awarded the title of one of the best films of 2012.The actors were all amazingly casted in their respective roles and do an amazing job of creating intriguing and lovable characters. Many of them were reprising roles they had taken on in previous films - Captain America, Thor or Iron Man, for example - so we already had a good idea of how they would perform, but I feel they all exceeded expectations. Robert Downey Jr was incredible as the humorous yet conflicted Tony Stark/ Iron Man, and Chris Evans was brilliant as the confused, out-of-time Steve Rogers/ Captain America. Mark Ruffalo, the newbie of the cast, stepped into the role of Bruce Banner/ Hulk with great skill and dispersed all doubts as to his suitability. On the other side, Tom Hiddleston really has to be congratulated for his convincing and somehow relatable performance as the villain Loki, whose wit and tricks appealed to fans everywhere.The special effects in this movie were undoubtedly excellent, and despite their need to be ostentatious never seemed unnecessarily unrealistic. The director Joss Whedon did a fabulous job and has created a cinematic classic that will be praised for years to come.",10.0,2012-12,Monday,"2012:0.09, actors:0.07, all:0.10, already:0.09, am:0.08, amazing:0.07, america:0.10, an:0.05, and:0.21, anyone:0.09, as:0.15, avengers:0.04, banner:0.07, be:0.16, best:0.05, brilliant:0.09, bruce:0.08, but:0.03, captain:0.10, cast:0.07, characters:0.04, chris:0.07, cinematic:0.09, come:0.07, did:0.06, director:0.07, do:0.06, does:0.06, downey:0.06, effects:0.06, end:0.07, evans:0.07, every:0.06, excellent:0.09, expectations:0.09, fact:0.09, fans:0.08, feel:0.08, films:0.12, for:0.10, good:0.05, great:0.05, had:0.11, has:0.14, hiddleston:0.07, his:0.10, how:0.06, hulk:0.04, idea:0.10, in:0.12, incredible:0.08, into:0.12, iron:0.09, is:0.03, it:0.06, job:0.15, joss:0.06, jr:0.06, loki:0.05, man:0.09, many:0.06, mark:0.06, movie:0.06, need:0.09, never:0.07, not:0.04, of:0.30, on:0.08, one:0.04, or:0.10, other:0.05, out:0.05, over:0.06, performance:0.09, previous:0.08, really:0.05, robert:0.06, role:0.09, ruffalo:0.06, say:0.06, seemed:0.10, so:0.04, special:0.07, stark:0.07, superhero:0.05, that:0.10, the:0.38, their:0.10, them:0.05, these:0.06, they:0.13, this:0.03, thor:0.05, time:0.05, to:0.22, tom:0.07, tony:0.08, up:0.05, villain:0.07, was:0.07, we:0.06, were:0.16, whedon:0.06, will:0.10, with:0.07, would:0.05, years:0.07, yet:0.08"

It might seen a little ""over-powered"" but the feeling you get, watching all of these personalities fight together, makes it work.

2012-08-30,"I am a big fan of science fiction. I have not been such a big fan of all movies based on comic books. I am not such a big fan of sequels either. The Avengers was a must-see-film for me, for several reasons, but most of all, I enjoyed both Iron Men, Captain America, and a bit of Thor as well. Hulk did not do the trick to me.The Avengers brings all these superheroes together. Their opponent is Thor's evil half-brother, Loki. His main goal is to get a magical stone, or cube, that would open the gateway to another dimension, to Asgard, where other, even more evil forces await to be released, and freed to the world of the humans.The action in the film, along with the SFX, is great. However, the storyline is not something you have not seen or heard before. Actually, there is very little new to the film. Also the decision to get all the superheroes or stars together, does not really differ much from Expendables, which is somewhat huge phenomenon, even though the script could be written by a 12-year-old.The Avengers is a lot better than Expendables, but that does not mean, it is a whole lot better, and that it would be better than, lets say Iron Man. For me Iron Man alone stands above The Avengers. The film does not come better with bigger explosions, and a lot more heroes, than in the original film. But obviously, with fans of the 80's stars in Expendables, it is enough to bring them all on the screen at once.What I truly enjoyed in this film was actually a few parts of the action. The one with Thor dropping out from the sky, or the parts in the end, with the heroes pretty much destroying most of the city-site.All in all, it is certainly a-must-see for the fans of comic stars, science fiction, and action. I enjoyed, but not that much, that I would recommend it to everybody.",7.0,2012-08,Thursday,"action:0.08, actually:0.10, all:0.16, along:0.06, also:0.04, am:0.10, america:0.03, and:0.09, another:0.05, as:0.02, at:0.03, avengers:0.10, be:0.08, been:0.04, before:0.05, better:0.16, big:0.12, bit:0.05, both:0.05, bring:0.06, brings:0.06, brother:0.05, but:0.09, by:0.03, captain:0.03, certainly:0.06, come:0.04, comic:0.08, could:0.04, did:0.04, do:0.04, does:0.12, end:0.04, enjoyed:0.17, enough:0.05, even:0.07, evil:0.11, fan:0.14, fans:0.10, few:0.05, film:0.16, for:0.09, from:0.06, get:0.07, great:0.03, half:0.06, have:0.05, heroes:0.08, his:0.03, however:0.05, huge:0.05, hulk:0.03, in:0.12, iron:0.09, is:0.18, it:0.09, little:0.05, loki:0.03, lot:0.13, main:0.05, man:0.06, me:0.10, more:0.06, most:0.07, movies:0.03, much:0.10, must:0.10, new:0.05, not:0.22, of:0.17, old:0.06, on:0.05, once:0.05, one:0.02, or:0.13, original:0.06, other:0.03, out:0.03, parts:0.13, pretty:0.05, really:0.03, recommend:0.06, say:0.04, screen:0.04, script:0.05, see:0.06, seen:0.04, something:0.05, stars:0.19, storyline:0.06, such:0.10, superheroes:0.08, than:0.10, that:0.10, the:0.46, their:0.03, them:0.03, there:0.03, these:0.04, this:0.02, thor:0.09, though:0.05, to:0.18, together:0.07, truly:0.06, very:0.03, was:0.05, well:0.03, what:0.03, where:0.04, which:0.04, whole:0.05, with:0.11, world:0.04, would:0.10, written:0.06, year:0.05, you:0.03"
2012-07-02,"Not much to say about this one that hasn't been said millions of times before. Brilliant comic-based movie that is, for me personally, the second best Marvel movie ever made, right behind Howard the Duck (kidding, kidding the first Iron Man film obviously). Joss Whedon further proves, as if any more evidence was needed, that as a writer/director he's amongst the top of his field. This is also the best Hulk film ever made and makes it more of a shame that the ball was dropped so badly in his own films. Bruce Banner is the stand out, but all the main superheroes have their very memorable moments, save for Hawkever whom is woefully underused and I hope his role is a tad flashed out on the upcoming extended cut.But really my minor gripes about the movie are few and far between.

2012-12-30,"OK went into the cinema in April, ready to give this film a fair chance. Of course i knew what to expect and as usual, i wasn't disappointed. Not that that's good for the film. After watching it i then began to hear almost everybody say it was the best film in the world. Well that a Huge claim. Well TBH it doesn't have any of the qualities of ""Best film ever made"" in it. Story was at best flawed, some characters i would go as far to say as boring and the Special FX were just a cover up, blinding viewers from the truth, its not a great film. And then there's the villain. Weak.But it's not all bad, i thought it was funny and if your a fan of everything exploding then it is good for a quick thrill.

2012-05-07,"For the past four years, Marvel Studios has been building a cinematic mythology based on their comic books, for the first time combining different franchises into a single canonical movie-universe. Starting in 2008 with ""Iron Man"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"", to 2010's ""Iron Man 2"" and finally last year's ""Thor"" and ""Captain America"", there have been five films building in anticipation to this result- the ultimate crossover experience. In addition to those four heroes, we are also given Black Widow, Hawkeye and Nick Fury, bringing our team of heroes to about seven. (Although Fury isn't a direct player, so I suppose the team stands at six)This movie had a lot to live up to.It succeeded. By god, this was an awesome movie!Directed and co-written by Joss Whedon, 2012's ""The Avengers"" is perfect payoff for fans who have been anticipating this film for over four years now.Beginning with Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) arriving at a SHIELD HQ, the Tesseract (the Asgard artifact used by Red Skull in last year's ""Captain America), which has been under lock-down for testing, opens a portal, allowing Loki (Tom Hiddleston) the outcast brother of Thor to arrive on Earth. He steals the Tesseract and uses his powers to brainwash several SHIELD members (including Hawkeye, portrayed by Jeremy Renner). It is revealed that Loki needs to the Tesseract to open a portal to allow an alien race to invade and conquer Earth.Realizing they are in over their heads, Fury calls out to unite the three Earthly heroes- Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans). After the team apprehends Loki, his brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is sent back to Earth, completing our team.When Loki escapes and is finally able to open the portal, the four heroes (joined by Scarlet Johansson as Black Widow and a redeemed Hawkeye) must band together, despite their differences, to defend the world in an ultimate battle.The acting in this film is outstanding. This really begins with our four leads. There is no need to speak about Downey, he continues to play the role to perfection. Hemsworth and Evans also are given a lot of good material to work with. In particular Evans, who gives the character of Steve Rogers subtle pain and pathos this time around despite having to be strong. But the real revelation is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner. I thought both Eric Bana and Edward Norton had given fine, first-class performances. Particularly Norton, who really made the role his own in a big way. But Ruffalo surprisingly blows them both out of the water. He makes the role of Bruce Banner (and the Hulk thanks to motion-capture technology) his own, giving him humor and an incredible depth. Ruffalo is OWED his own Hulk movie now.In addition the supporting performances are incredible. The gorgeous Johansson is given a lot more to do in this film, and she breaths a great life into Black Widow. To be honest, Black Widow was at times more compelling than our four leads, and Johansson proves once again to be a phenomenal actress. Clark Gregg reprises his ""Iron Man"" and ""Thor"" role as SHIELD agent Phil Coulson, and provides some great comedic moments, in addition to being the shady government type. Hiddleston is menacing and dark as Loki. Stellan Skarsgard and Gwenyth Paltrow return in small roles as Erik Selvig and Pepper Potts, and although their scenes are minor, both ground the film emotionally. The only slight problem I had was with Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. I will say, he gave a fine performance, but his role seemed... somewhat underwritten in comparison with everyone else. He felt a little too expendable a character and shoe-horned in. But Renner was still good in the role.The script by Whedon (from a story he co-wrote with Zak Penn) is tight, concise and an absolute blast. There is a lot of humor (and I do mean a lot) and a ton of action, although it never feels forced, contrived or unneeded. As fantastical as the story is, it is grounded in it's own sort of reality and logic, and feels natural. This is an extremely well-written, fun and generally light-hearted film.The visuals are a blast. Whedon's direction and camera placement is fun, kinetic and serves as a good companion piece to the other four directors who had previously helmed the individual films. The effects are outstanding. The sound design is great. The score by Alan Silvestri is fun and memorable.This is just a competently made film, and a darned-fine piece of entertainment!I will say that this isn't necessarily the best film in the series (I think the first ""Iron Man"" felt a tad more fresh and unique), but this is still an absolute blast, and you cannot afford to miss it on the big screen!I give ""The Avengers"" a near-perfect 9 out of 10!

2024-05-12,"The Marvel brand used to be the standard bearer. Today it's on the verge of needing a pallbearer. After a decade spent meticulously building a cohesive cinematic world, Disney released ""Avengers End Game"". It's a bit bloated, as you might expect for a story that had to tie together a nearly infinite number of plot and character threads, but it triumphantly sticks the landing on the so-called Infinity Saga and brings to a close one of cinema's grandest experiments.In the five years since ""End Game"", Disney has lost sight of what made their Marvel brand so successful in the first place. Sure, the over-saturation of the superhero/comic book genre hasn't helped. I get the sense that the genre, like the Roman Empire before it, is in its last days. But if Disney wants to recapture their momentum, they need to rediscover their purpose and return to what made the MCU great in the first place. And they need look no further than the first ""Avengers""Well written, expertly made and featuring excellent performances by all of the major actors, it remains the gold standard for the MCU, and the blueprint for how Disney can stop the rotting decay of their brand and return it to its former glory.Oh, and this goes for Star Wars, too.",8.0,2024-05,Sunday,"actors:0.07, after:0.06, all:0.03, and:0.21, as:0.04, avengers:0.07, be:0.04, before:0.07, bit:0.08, book:0.07, brings:0.09, but:0.07, by:0.05, can:0.05, character:0.05, cinema:0.09, cinematic:0.09, comic:0.06, end:0.14, excellent:0.09, expect:0.09, first:0.16, for:0.13, genre:0.19, get:0.06, goes:0.09, great:0.05, had:0.05, has:0.05, how:0.06, if:0.05, in:0.12, is:0.03, it:0.17, its:0.12, last:0.08, like:0.04, look:0.08, made:0.17, marvel:0.09, mcu:0.19, might:0.09, need:0.17, no:0.06, of:0.19, on:0.08, one:0.04, over:0.06, performances:0.09, place:0.19, plot:0.06, sense:0.09, since:0.08, so:0.09, star:0.09, stop:0.09, story:0.05, superhero:0.05, sure:0.08, than:0.05, that:0.06, the:0.51, their:0.20, they:0.09, this:0.03, to:0.19, together:0.05, too:0.06, used:0.09, wants:0.11, well:0.05, what:0.10, world:0.07, written:0.09, years:0.07, you:0.04"

2019-07-16,"The Avengers is the definition of a perfect superhero film as it ticks all the boxes when it comes to humor, action, drama and even emotion. Not only did Joss Whedon understand how to tell any interesting superhero story, but he added weight to it by giving each of the main characters a reason to be there. The plot might seen simple at first, but in reality gives you more than what you asked for. The interactions between the characters are amazing and is the reason why I love these big superhero team films. Loki is one of the best comic book movie villains as he not only gets under the Avengers' skin, but also is able to tear them apart, which leads to internal and external conflicts.

2012-06-13,"What a disappointment, although really not surprised at how bad it was. A totally boring, endless and mostly witless movie aimed at brain-deadened people who think that special effects, explosions and fantasy but definitely not fantastic characters make for a great movie. The cinematography was gray and cloudy, the editing incomprehensible, and the acting unsurprising and depressingly familiar. Simple, human emotions, which used to be integral to a movie are now so rare. Noise and all-too-familiar mayhem have been substituted.

2012-05-07,"Back on Earth through time and space, imperially arrogant god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) says, ""Freedom is the great lie"" Thor's half brother will make the world his new kingdom. The brave souls, who stand in his path, are The Avengers. Director and Writer Joss Whedon's ""The Avengers"" convincingly assembles solo superheroes and super egos to battle Loki and his alien minions in one of the year's best movies. Think of Whedon as Coach Phil Jackson, but for superheroes. Robert Downey Jr. as brash Tony Stark threatens Norse god Loki, ""If we can't protect the Earth, you can be damn sure we'll avenge it."" ""The Avengers"" is awesome.The classic hero story requires a commanding villain, and that is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Hiddleston is charismatic evil and sympathetic sadness. He evokes certain pathos for Loki, feeling betrayed by his foil half brother Thor, strong and compassionate Chris Hemsworth. Thor fights with all his might against his brother, out of love and honor. Blond maned and shredded Hemsworth balances aloof charm and conviction as Thor. Whedon's ""The Avengers"" is timelessly inspiring: We believe in heroes who believe in themselves and others and would sacrifice their lives for the noble and just cause. I think the captivating leads of ""The Avengers"" are Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans. Downey Jr. brilliantly hides beneath Iron Man's Tony Stark's cynical narcissistic veneer, a caring man wiser than his smart ass punch lines. Evans is surprising. Aside from looking amazingly chiseled he embodies in Steve Rogers (Captain America) a self doubting relevance, while the inspired leader emerges. His Rogers is the frozen super soldier who awakens 70 years later into a new war.The cool Stark and the solid Rogers clash passionately. Stark mourns a fallen friend. Rogers asks if this is the first time he has lost a soldier. Stark screams, ""We are not soldiers!"" Whedon and Zak Pen's story is kinetically driven, with the foundation laid in character. Powerful egos and intentions must coalesce and foster value and respect—as some sort of functional family tasked with saving the world.Whedon generates amazing performances, and infuses welcome wit and humor. To that end, Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, Director of the clandestine S.H.I.E.L.D., maybe the sinuous plot device. After making a career of cameos in previous Marvel superhero movies, Jackson fleshes out his bad ass Fury. He brings a refreshing gruff self awareness, after all The Avengers was his initiative so that these heroes would fight the fight we couldn't. However, is he the tough love patriot or calculated manipulator? Jackson cannily walks that fine line. Beautiful and idealist Cobie Smulders as loyal Agent Hill is Fury's social conscience. Stark, Rogers, and Dr. Banner (Mark Ruffalo) discern Fury's possible other motives shrouded in National Security.Exiled Loki brokers an alliance with the warrior alien race, the Chitauri. The Chitauri will let him rule Earth, if he brings them the Tesseract (Hyper Cube). The Tesseract harnesses the power of the galaxy, and is mysteriously tied to both Thor and Captain America. Loki uses the Tesseract to escape exile and breach S.H.I.E.L.D. Obtaining Tesseract, he brainwashes brave Agent Hawkeye (solid Jeremy Renner). Loki has a grand scheme. Expert straight man Clark Gregg as reliable Agent Coulson must call upon the team to protect the world. Scarlett Johansson is hot and deadly as Agent Natasha (Black Widow). She dispatches Russian mafia captors with Muay Thai and jujitsu in Jason Statham like style. She heads off to Calcutta to find Dr. Bruce Banner, and his raging green alter ego The Hulk. Ruffalo adds an understated brilliance and goofy charm that humanizes. We really believe that he has made his peace and controlled the ""other guy"". Coulson calls upon Stark (Downey Jr.), who is in the midst of clean power sourcing his Stark Tower. Stark has a playful relationship with his partner Pepper Potts (funny and beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow). Too bad Paltrow isn't leveraged more in ""The Avengers"".Of course assembling a bunch of super powered heroes is not immediate team building. Whedon orchestrates spectacular clashes amongst themselves. Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America battling in the dark forest is visually stunning. The Hulk taking on Thor is wild and strangely comical. The Hulk gets the prize for his cage match with evil Loki. The audience exploded in applause. Ruffalo is amazing. His casual nerd nicely bonds with Downey Jr.'s impatient genius. Renner as Hawkeye is solid and edgy, and plays nice. Johansson looks awesome in the black body suit. Even more impressive she shades the darkness and nobility of Natasha. She has a killer scene with Hiddleston at the story arc.""The Avengers"" delivers with the explosive visual spectacle as our heroes risk their lives battling the powerful aliens as they pulverize New York City. Whedon is masterful with the action and the characters.

2012-05-26,"I love the Avengers, in theory. Unfortunately, in practice I couldn't wait for this movie to end.From the empty backstory for the 'bad guys', to a total lack of empathy for any of the main characters, I found this whole experience soul crushingly dull. Which is odd when there's an explosion or a fist fight every 5 minutes.It would be quite annoying to work out the veneer-thin plot if not having seen some of the prior Marvel outings for Thor, Iron Man, et al, but there are some saving graces.An almost seamless set of special effects does lend a sense of realism to the ridiculous scenarios that the heroes find themselves in. And with plenty of running time to allow each a fair chunk of screen time, it doesn't feel as if any one member is worth less than the rest.That's part of the problem for me- with trying to squeeze an equal share for everyone in, it starts to feel patched together, losing coherence. When the flow begins to break up, my attention span begins to shorten.

2012-05-10,"I walked into The Avengers tonight expecting something fascinating, instead I was given a screwed up 1st and 2nd act, and a balls to the wall 3rd act.The Avengers was setting a really great tone of delving into a dark story of earth's take over by Loki and his army, and every time the film would go down this darker path, whether it be editing or poor script writing, as soon as it had you emotionally, and at the edge of your seat, a completely UN-needed joke or comedic moment was thrown in that totally destroyed the moment.This film easily could have had 20 minutes shaved off the run time, and no offense to JW fans, but he wasn't competent enough to direct this film. Had JF did this flick, I am sure the tone would have been much more in line with the Iron Man films, and of course the tone of the spin-offs (Thor, Capt. America) I will admit I was disappointed that Ed Norton didn't come back as Bruce Banner, but Mark Ruffalo made me forget about Ed within 3 minutes, but let us all be honest here, this was Robert Downey Jr's movie from the get go. The man is a great actor and he stole the entire film without even breaking a sweat. Others tried to keep up, but I think they were unprepared, and this can also be the fault of the director, it is his job to bring the performances out of the cast that are needed.What was really disappointing was the depth of character development, or I should say the poor execution of it. I know some folks will say, you have to see the other flicks and there you get your character development, but keep in mind, most audiences probably have not seen the other films and walked into this one with the hopes of learning what was needed to be known about everyone. Keep in mind not all of us are comic fans or superhero fans, and a film that is more or less a separate entry into the Marvel Universe, came off more like a sequel instead of an initial entry.As I noted the 3rd act was great. The war and battles were fantastic from start to finish. The cinematography and choreography for this sequence was top notch stuff, it is just a shame the amount of work that went into the third act wasn't put into the 1st and 2nd.Anyway, this is just my opinion on the flick.

2015-01-27,"As a reviewer, I don't mess up often but, just like the line where Stark is ribbing Loki, sometimes even an IMDb top reviewer can have performance issues.My first view, I was annoyed that so much time was spent on backstory and it took an hour to get the ball rolling. Although in fairness once this story starts to move in the second hour, it MOVES.By my third viewing I could see the issue. I grew up with these characters and I had expectations. The expectations were incorrect, I now know, because those expectations were the reason the Marvel library was such a mess before the arrival of the Whedon Bros.So what Joss did was analyzed what was not working in past Marvel films then de-constructed the Avengers story, then build a film which could act as a base for future sequels, wit ha solid foundation.And wrote a script to die for. By the third time around I was actually listening to the film instead of just watching, and boy can that guy write.Like the line I posted as the title of this review. It took me 3 viewings to catch it. It is sly, it is sexual, and it is totally easy to overlook in all the action. But I was on the floor laughing.So there you go, it is fun, action packed (last hour), written at an Oscar level, the characters are perfectly cast (except the Nick Fury I grew up with was Caucasion, but I guess no one remembers) and, to keep the suits happy, not only made a bundle on its own but launched a new franchise.So that's a 10***********************************************ATT IMDb READERS IN THE BLIND -- ATT IMDb READERS IN THE BLINDJust watched this for the 8th time and want to update my review. As of this year (2017) this is, at the same time, one of the best ""action"" films in the history of the medium and one of the best scripts in the history of action films. I believe Joss received only one award for the screenplay, which is a pity, because it shows that the industry simply does not respect this genre. The little twists and turns that hold viewer attention like glue (""I'M ALWAYS ANGRY"" ""PUNY GOD"") are a Whedon trademark, and massively under-appreciated. I will also suggest that nothing with the Marvel brand that has arrived since Avengers I has been this good -- and I am including all their TV and other off-cable projects in that comment. The only flaw, and I mean the ONLY one, is that the close of this film sets an entire armada of ""politically correct"" followups having to do with the public blaming superheroes ... for being superheroes.

2012-04-16,"I have not bothered to write a review about a movie for a while, but this one deserves it. After seeing a screening of the film at Madrid, I can say that The Avengers is The best superhero movie ever made (TM). One of the reasons that make me think like this is that I didn't love all the individual films of the characters.Captain America was right, Thor is average but entertaining and a with an awesome casting, the Hulk only was interesting when the big guy smashed, the second Iron Man was awful.This film exceeds by far the sum of its parts.It is bright, cheerful, colorful. A film by gentlemen in pajamas punching bad guys. Even the Black Widow, totally plain in Iron Man, has a great girl power Whedon style role. It is full of references to the readers, but I swear that every one has a twist that makes them even more fun.Of course, you have some script inconsistencies, and failure to apologize for cursing! Is a comic of gentlemen in pajamas, not The Regent! It has both humor grateful to see the original version and I have no doubt that the dubbing stamina.I wanted to applaud, to cheer... I wish you a experience like mine, with all the cinema enjoying. It is an experience that reminds us that sometimes, just sometimes, a film is much more than watching alone a movie surrounded by other people.Some might say that the Batman movies are better. I would say they are even different genres. Spiderman 2 is the only superhero movie that genuinely, in my humble opinion, can compete.Nobody here is going to win an Oscar, but that does not mean that it can not win a special place in your hearts.And the post-final after the credits ... Okay I expected it. But here we have our final wink, the ultimate gift for those who have spent years reading Marvel comics.

2017-04-05,"... but is the ultimate fan of Joss Whedon. I came to this film with virtually no background in the Marvelverse, so I was a bit confused at first. My husband helped fill in the blanks by stopping the film when I had questions, but I have to admit the script did a good job of filling in the blanks minus a few details. This is an excellent film of its genre that incorporates everything special effects can do today with great character development, courtesy of Joss Whedon who wrote and directed this blockbuster masterpiece. Do you know how rare it is to have blockbuster and masterpiece in the same sentence? He has to know that at some level that he, once again, did the impossible. He took what could have easily been a disaster and he produced gold. He created a movie that was fun, and exciting and shaped and brought cohesion to the Marvel Movie Universe and gave each character their time to shine. It has great acting; quippy dialogue; tons of very well done action; and a decent, if underplayed, level of ambiguity to the morality of the characters. They worked individually, they worked collectively. It had lots of Ultimate Alliance moments. Hulk shoves a piece of armor into the giant worm and Thor hammers it into his head, Thor brings his hammer down on Cap's shield and causes a huge shockwave, Thor shoots lightning at Iron Man and causes his suit to boost up to like 400+% giving him a supercharged shot. I love that all of those moments were added. I also love how Joss had a bunch of the heroes fight each other in a way that made sense in the context of the movie. Thor vs Hulk, Thor vs Cap, Thor Vs Iron Man, Hawkeye vs Black Widow, Black Widow vs Hulk. You can't help but love each and every fight. Will people still be talking about it 80 years from now the way they talk about Citizen Kane? Probably not. But Whedon accomplished in the 2010's in making a film in which I was completely engrossed for two and a half hours, had a wonderful and fun time and wondered where the time had gone when the credits rolled.

2019-08-19,"Avengers Assemble is a big budget summer blockbuster that's action packed & perfectly cast, it's so Awesome to see these heroes we all grew up loving on screen together in a big adventure fantasy Thriller!!!Avengers has the right amount of seriousness & light humour, the action scenes are Awesome!!!
It's amazing seeing Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Iron man together fighting side by side & we also have the Awesome Hawkeye & Black Widow joining the fight.The cast is excellent, we have the legendary Samuel l Jackson as Nick Fury the guy who Assembles the Avengers when a threat against earth rises.
Chris Evans is perfect as Steve Rogers aka Captain America he's my favourite of the Avengers team & one of my favourite Marvel characters ever along with The Punisher & Daredevil.
Evans has the perfect balance of lost & weary old school soldier & also in control tough & confident leader when needed, he's a fantastic complex character.
The whole cast is perfect though, Thor is fun, tough & loyal & that's down to a great performance from Chris Hemsworth!!!
Robert Downey Jr is perfect as rich guy super hero Iron man, he's playful, funny & super smart it's a fantastic performance.
Mark Ruffalo is excellent as the big mighty incredible Hulk, another perfect performance bringing nice guy scientist Bruce Banner to life & the big green beast within.
The absolutely beautiful Scarlett Johansson is outstanding as extremely tough & super smart Black Widow, she's extremely Dangerous & extremely brave.
Also we have the excellent marksman Hawkeye played perfectly by Jeremy Renner who is probably my 2nd fave character after Captain America, Hawkeye is a Cool, tough & loyal warrior.
This first Avengers film is truly OUTSTANDING!!!
A big piece of pure fantasy entertainment & a near perfect super hero film.

2012-07-17,"I loved The Avengers, it is easily my favorite movie of the year so far! It's the kind of movie that left us happy afterwards, that made us want to discuss it at length and made us leave reality; in every sense an aesthetic experience. I loved the action scenes, special effects, and all, but I suppose what I loved best about it were the hilarious one-liners that literally had the entire cinema laughing out loud. There were so many of these, too many to count with my fingers, in fact. There was also one moment when I actually cried, but then that was just me. I tend to cry over everything. *Sheepish smile.*I was initially afraid that so many characters in one movie would result in one convoluted mess, but the writers managed to make a script that somehow gave each character their own screen time without making it appear too contrived, or as though they just forcibly slotted a story in just so a certain character could appear. The entire story actually made sense and flowed naturally into one cohesive whole.I was also initially afraid that so many hunky heroes in one movie would make my heart or brain explode from confusion as to which one to 'ship, as I had fallen in love with each one of these heroes when I watched their individual films in the years past. (Okay, not all of them, just Iron Man, Thor and Captain America.) But here's what I realized - The Avengers makes for an interesting study in finding out what a girl truly finds attractive in a man, depending on who she loves most among the heroes. Is it Captain America, the handsome and wholesome boy next door with the hero's noble heart? Is it Thor, the fierce, masculine man with rippling muscles, facial hair and deep throaty growl? Is it the Hulk, the reserved brainiac with a surprisingly endearing shy smile? Or it it Iron Man, the witty genius billionaire playboy philanthropist (in his own words)?I am not going to recap the story, just go watch it yourself!

2021-11-15,"To love movies is to enjoy good movies, no matter how you define them. If there are good movies, there are bad movies. While some people claim to hate CGI, there are those of us who consider it another tool to make a movie, but think it can be misused.I like a lot of superhero movies. I have been enjoying most of the Marvel Studio movies, but some are better than others. It turns out I like the big fight sequence in the first Avengers movie because it clearly takes place around Grand Central. I can relate to it, since I am a native New Yorker. I take pleasure in seeing how the Helmsley Palace tunnels are used, and the Pershing Overpass. The Spiderman movie with the elevated train along Canal Street annoyed me.There are lots of movies that use ""movie geography"" that makes no sense and they don't all use CGI. There was a Michael Keaton vehicle about twenty years ago called THE HARD WAY which annoyed me with its nonsensical geography.

2012-04-27,"The movie touches on all bases that a good super-hero / fantasy movie should. A fantastic story line, solid action, good humor, and amazing visuals.The story is a bit much, kinda out-there (literally) but it is in keeping with the nature of the Thor / Asgard storyline. You cant include a Norse God without accepting some magik / fantasy elements. Plus the Avengers always tackled those issues in the books. Even the pacing was right on; at no point does it get slow or bogged down in exposition. Bottom line: it works.The action is solid on all levels, and some of it is just breathtaking. Even the face-offs are surprising, and fun to watch. Best action in a superhero movie period.The humor / emotion: the movie is hilarious without being stupid or directed at 8-year olds. Lucas / DC Comics take note! You don't have to make lame, childish jokes to be funny. Think more Joker with the pencil than anything in Green Lantern. Downey Jr is the driving force of this movie, and his Stark is turned up a notch. There a some literal laugh-out-loud moments in there, and some moments where the theater became deathly still. They pull strings without making you feel like a puppet.Finally, visually the movie looks amazing. ILM outdid themselves, and the one spot I'm sure everyone was worried about, the green one, just looks sick. Not a lot of shake-the-camera fake action, but some great scenes, even a few surprising choices of vantage points.The cast was perfect, Ruffalo IS Banner. A throwback to the Bixby days, instantly making you forget Norton or Bana. Evans owns the Cap / Leader / Good Guy role. You want to follow him. Johannson is a bad-ass in her role, Hemsworth is good, although Thor is kinda one-note. Hawkeye is an intriguing character, and Renner has the same great smirky tension he had in Hurt Locker. Agent Coulson has a much-expanded role in this, and his parts are special in themselves. And of course, Downey is king.Im not a huge Avengers fan, never was. X-Men or The Justice League were always my favorites, so I'm not total fanboy, but I think this movie captured every element a true comic fan would want to see on the screen, and casual fans can just enjoy it as well, because it stands alone as a great movie. Probably the best since First Class, maybe the best since Dark Knight. I know I walked out feeling like I did after Return Of The King.

2012-04-26,"So they all come together to fight a battle they cannot fight on their own. They don't exactly get along or have much appreciation for each other to begin with, but this is what makes this film work. This has been a long time lead up, starting back in 2008 with Iron Man and then ever so slightly linking each of these individual films together. It has been a hugely lucrative series for Marvel, sometimes good and other times not so good, it has all been leading to this point.For me, the picks out of these previous films are Iron Man and Thor, with The Hulk behind that and then right at the bottom, Captain America. Iron Man was fantastically fun with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jnr.), the larger than life character who has it all. He is smart, witty, funny and extremely like able and loves what most boys do, his toys. With a great visionary director in Jon Favreau at the helm both the Iron Man films were extremely enjoyable. Thor, had a great cast in Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins and Tom Hiddleston. Kenneth Branagh really captured the fun and excitement of the story. The second attempt at The Hulk was quite good, but Norton, as much as I love him was not quite the right choice. The CGI Hulk was never really there yet and always felt very animated and never part of the furniture. Captain American, as a movie didn't work for me. There was not enough about him to keep me interested, not enough fun had. I love Chris Evans and thought he was the right choice, but with a fairly dull script and a much too serious approach, I was quite bored by the end.Now the question was always going to be, can they work as a group? With the much needed change of Bruce Bana to Mark Rufallo, and a few additional characters thrown in, the answer is a gigantic yes! Joss Wheddon does an amazing job of keeping a huge number of characters in tune. It is always the toughest element in story telling and here it really had a huge potential of being jumbled and disjointed. It is none of the above and on the contrary it is, in its entirety, exceptionally well balanced. The banter between the characters is priceless and gives the film a consistent flow and usually arises in what would normally be fairly dull background scenes. Everyone is extremely good, but the newcomer Mark Rufallo shines as Bruce Bana and 'the other guy'. The special effects for The Hulk are incredible and they have finally got him pretty much perfectly moulded into his surroundings. With the CGI sorted and the right actor behind the green monster, he seriously works and almost steels the show. Not quite, but he certainly steels any scenes he is in. Downey Jnr. as Stark is his usual witty, charming self and sets the banter off with great timing and finesse. Newcomers to the series in Black Widow played by the luscious Scarlett Johansson and Hawkeye played by the always solid Jeremy Renner are both commendable additions and both fit in marvelously. Tom Hiddleston as Loku, the villain of this story, plays his part impeccably well and deserves much praise and respect for this outing.The special effects are superb and the fight scenes are tremendous. Joss Whedon has definitely shown he is an avid comic book fan himself. He shows that he is not afraid to have fun with his material, and this really is the whole point. Where Chistopher Nolan has brilliantly turned Batman into a dark knight, Whedon constantly lightens the mood, which really is the only way this type of ensemble film could work. There is never a dull moment as the pace of the film is constant and this makes for a hugely entertaining film in ever way. This really is a perfectly made comic book adaptation.Smart, witty, funny, and hugely entertaining! This action packed joyride is brimming with different personalities, huge egos and awesome super powers. They work together perfectly in this marvel from Marvel!

Then with some other films in order we the fans have finally gotten what we deserve and that is the crown jewel called THE AVENGERS. This film defiantly deserves the award for most anticipated summer film, best superhero film and so on. If there is one flaw i had to give this film its that this film has an ending to it.

2023-11-25,"When we got to know that all of Marvels mightiest heroes would unite in this film it had a lot of expectations. The plot in itself is half decent. Quite predictable in some parts, but also had some intelligent bits. I found the acting of some characters a bit cliche, for example Chris Hemsworth and Samuel L Jackson. Tom Hiddleston has done well in the parts he could shine, but there wasn't much scope to his evilness. He just was evil. Not saying I would've wanted a background story on him, but would've liked some more dimension to his character. As always from Marvel, CGI and action scenes are done very professionally. I personally also liked the new film score for this movie.My rating is 6/10, because story was quite simple for the most part and some characters were a little too one dimensional.

2012-05-11,"I don't usually write reviews and I am not an expert on analyzing all that cinematographic stuff or how god of a job director did. All I can say is that I had a time of my life. It was an amazing film with an amazing storyline and amazing actors in it. When I first heard about the avengers, I was very happy yet skeptical about it. My biggest concern was how they were going to put all these legendary characters into one film and provide them all with enough screen time to achieve some character development. Even after seeing it I have no idea how they did it, but they not only did it they smashed it. Right from the start I was taken to a ride of my life, I could not take my eyes out of what was going on. In terms of special effect, it was top-notch as it was expected no question about it. People are praising this film for being very witty and having a lot of comedy in it, I have to say I am not a fan of comedy, but this film made me laugh more than any other comedy in a very long time. Having to see Hulk smashing Loki or Capitan America patronizing Iron-man, or Iron-Man fighting Thor, was something you could have dreamt of to see on the big screen when you were a kid. But having a chance to see it done and developed in such an effective and spectacular fashion was beyond my wildest expectations, and trust me I had very high hopes for this film. Well, sorry for not being very structured and coherent about the whole thing, I just wanted to share a little bit of joy and excitement that I have been provided with watching this amazing film.

2024-11-15,"Hello everyone, I'm Mr. C Reviewer, tonight we are discussing the Movie, The Avengers. I watched it on Disney plus. The Movie first aired April 11, 2012. It has a runtime of 2 hours and 23 minutes. The avengers was rated PG-13. The Movie was directed and created by Joss Whedon and was also created by Zak Penn.Summary: When Earth faces an unprecedented threats, Nick Fury, the director of S. H. I. E. L. D., realizes that only a team of extraordinary individuals can save humanity.Review: -I found the voice-over at the beginning of the movie to be captivating; it sparked my interest and motivated me to continue watching. I was pleased that it took only about five minutes for the action to commence. Before watching this movie, I had just finished reviewing the previous instalment, so I skipped the trailer. I was pleasantly surprised to see one of the characters return, as I hadn't anticipated it. I'm glad I avoided the trailer since it revealed that character to being in this one. I appreciated the casting choices, even though Hulk was recast for this film. Each actor seemed well-suited to their roles, contributing to a strong performance overall. I found the gore in the movie to be visually impressive; some scenes appeared quite realistic, while others were less convincing. As an autistic individual, I was especially grateful for the inclusion of subtitles, which made it easier to follow the dialogue. However, I felt a bit disappointed that translations were not provided for dialogue spoken in other languages.I appreciated the film's cinematography, particularly its frequent use of close-ups to capture characters' emotions during intense moments. Medium shots framed characters from the waist up, facilitating interaction while providing context. Long shots established settings and showcased characters within their environments, especially effective in action sequences highlighting the scale of battles. High angle shots conveyed vulnerability among characters, while low angle shots used emphasized strength and dominance. Tracking Shots followed characters through space, enhancing viewer immersion. Over-the-Shoulder Shots captured dialogue exchanges, offering one character's perspective while highlighting the other's reactions. Establishing Shots introduced locations before action unfolded, with wide-angle views orienting viewers within various New York City settings. Montage Sequences combined rapid shot types to convey information quickly and depict the passage of time effectively. Dim lighting was used strategically to emphasize key elements within the frame. I found the film's soundtrack and sound effects to be particularly effective, as they complemented the scenes.I appreciated the CGI in the movie for its ability to create visually stunning sequences that enhanced the film's spectacle. The climactic battle scenes, especially those featuring large-scale destruction and alien invasions, showcased impressive visual effects that added realism to the superhero genre. The scale and detail of the CGI effectively immersed viewers in the action, complementing rather than overshadowing the narrative.I appreciated the film's focus on teamwork and unity. The story centres around a group of diverse individuals who come together to form a cohesive team, despite their differences. The superheroes must overcome their egos and learn to accept each other's assistance. Their distinct personalities make collaboration challenging, especially since they are accustomed to being the sole stars of their own narratives, which complicates their ability to unite. One of my favourite aspects was the humour woven throughout the movie. The clever exchanges between characters not only provide comic relief but also deepen their personalities, making them more relatable to the audience. This allows viewers to emotionally connect with each character, fostering a sense of investment in their individual journeys. Watching how each character interacts and reacts to one another was truly my favourite part of the film.-I appreciated the pacing at which we were introduced to the characters. My favourite character in this movie was Hulk; I found his personality both engaging and humorous. I also value Black Widow for her complexity and exceptional combat abilities, which enable her to stand shoulder to shoulder with her male counterparts. I admire that she was not merely a sidekick but an essential member of the team. However, I do feel that her character didn't received the same level of depth in development as her male peers.-I felt that the movie was a bit longer than necessary, and at times it seemed to drag. I enjoyed the ending and am eagerly anticipating the next instalment when all the characters reunite. I also appreciated the additional scenes after the credits; there were two, cleverly spaced between more credits with this one.I rate each Movie I watch out of 10 and for this one, I give it an 7.1 Remember this was what I thought about the film personally and I suggest that you give it a go for yourself.",7.0,2024-11,Friday,"10:0.03, 2012:0.03, about:0.04, action:0.06, actor:0.03, after:0.02, alien:0.03, all:0.01, also:0.09, am:0.03, an:0.07, and:0.19, another:0.03, are:0.03, around:0.03, as:0.06, at:0.05, audience:0.03, avengers:0.03, battle:0.03, be:0.05, before:0.05, beginning:0.04, being:0.05, between:0.05, bit:0.06, black:0.02, both:0.03, but:0.03, by:0.04, can:0.02, cgi:0.06, character:0.12, characters:0.15, come:0.03, comic:0.02, credits:0.07, depth:0.04, development:0.03, dialogue:0.10, didn:0.03, director:0.03, disappointed:0.04, do:0.02, each:0.11, earth:0.03, effects:0.04, enjoyed:0.03, especially:0.12, even:0.02, everyone:0.03, feel:0.03, felt:0.06, film:0.11, first:0.02, for:0.10, found:0.15, from:0.02, fury:0.03, genre:0.04, give:0.06, go:0.02, group:0.03, had:0.02, has:0.02, her:0.17, high:0.03, his:0.02, hours:0.04, how:0.02, however:0.06, hulk:0.03, humour:0.04, impressive:0.08, in:0.10, individual:0.07, it:0.11, its:0.05, joss:0.02, just:0.02, less:0.04, long:0.03, made:0.02, make:0.02, making:0.03, me:0.02, minutes:0.07, moments:0.03, more:0.04, movie:0.13, must:0.03, my:0.07, new:0.03, next:0.03, nick:0.03, not:0.04, of:0.19, on:0.03, one:0.10, only:0.06, other:0.06, others:0.03, out:0.02, over:0.05, overall:0.03, own:0.03, part:0.03, performance:0.03, previous:0.03, quite:0.03, rather:0.04, review:0.03, same:0.03, save:0.04, scenes:0.09, see:0.02, seemed:0.08, sense:0.03, sequences:0.10, she:0.04, since:0.06, so:0.02, some:0.02, stand:0.04, stars:0.04, story:0.02, superhero:0.02, superheroes:0.02, team:0.07, than:0.04, that:0.12, the:0.55, their:0.17, them:0.02, there:0.02, they:0.03, this:0.09, those:0.03, though:0.03, thought:0.03, through:0.03, throughout:0.04, time:0.02, times:0.03, to:0.27, together:0.02, truly:0.04, two:0.03, up:0.02, used:0.07, visual:0.03, was:0.19, watch:0.02, watched:0.03, watching:0.08, we:0.05, well:0.02, were:0.08, what:0.02, whedon:0.02, when:0.04, which:0.09, while:0.11, who:0.02, widow:0.02, with:0.05, york:0.04, you:0.02"

2013-02-25,"First of all, let me just establish the follow IMDb film ratings as a reference:A Clockwork Orange: 8.5 - Aliens (1986): 8.5 - American Beauty: 8.5 - Full Metal Jacket: 8.4 - Chinatown: 8.4 - Fargo: 8.2 - Donnie Darko: 8.1 - A Scanner Darkly: 7These are the kind of movies that get (and should get) 8+ ratings. They have real content. They're innovative, original, intelligent and thought-provoking. They're timeless classics.But the comparison may not be too fair, being such different genres. How does it REALLY stand up to Batman Begins (8.3), Watchmen (7.6), or any of the X-Men series, none of which reached and 8? These are all meant to fascinate and woe the same kind of target: comic-book fans, adrenaline-pumped teenagers and action-yearning males. Yet they are aeons away in terms of originality, depth, story and execution from 2012's The Avengers.I don't really have much of a gripe with ""The Avengers"" itself, as after seeing Captain America, I expected nothing more than another formulaic blockbuster. Even so, it's pretty bad even for a fill-in-the-villain/superhero/threat formula movie. A ridiculous super villain, flat characters, no excitement (as you know how things are going to turn out)My disappointment is mostly with IMDb. I'd trusted their rating in the past, but it seems as if that reliability is no longer. Either all the reviews are now being written by 10-year-olds, IMDb users are losing brain cells at an incredible pace, or something's pretty fishy.How many reviews that are titled things like ""Awesome! Blew my mind!"", or ""Coolest superhero movie ever!"", that you'd expect to be full of teenage adulation, grammatical mistakes and tons of slang, are actually very articulately written, displaying profound knowledge of script, direction, acting, and character analysis? I thought our education system was going down the drain! Where are all these lucid, eloquent, youths hiding out? And, being so instructed and discerning as they are, why the hell are they giving such a poorly made, mediocre movie such high scores?It looks like the industry's eye has finally set on IMDb's viewer-decanting power, and is corrupting it's authenticity beyond recognition. From now on, I guess I'll have to look elsewhere for real, trustworthy reviews.",1.0,2013-02,Monday,"10:0.05, 2012:0.06, acting:0.05, action:0.03, actually:0.06, after:0.05, all:0.10, america:0.04, an:0.03, and:0.21, another:0.05, any:0.04, are:0.31, as:0.13, at:0.03, avengers:0.05, away:0.06, awesome:0.05, bad:0.05, batman:0.07, be:0.06, being:0.14, blockbuster:0.06, book:0.05, but:0.05, by:0.03, captain:0.04, character:0.04, characters:0.03, comic:0.04, depth:0.07, different:0.06, does:0.05, don:0.04, down:0.06, even:0.08, ever:0.05, expect:0.06, expected:0.07, fans:0.05, film:0.03, finally:0.06, first:0.04, for:0.05, from:0.06, full:0.13, get:0.08, giving:0.07, going:0.10, has:0.03, have:0.08, high:0.06, how:0.13, if:0.04, imdb:0.30, in:0.06, incredible:0.05, is:0.06, it:0.10, itself:0.07, just:0.03, kind:0.13, know:0.05, let:0.06, like:0.06, ll:0.06, look:0.06, looks:0.07, made:0.04, many:0.04, may:0.06, me:0.04, mind:0.06, more:0.03, movie:0.07, movies:0.03, much:0.04, my:0.07, no:0.08, not:0.03, nothing:0.06, now:0.10, of:0.19, on:0.06, or:0.11, original:0.07, our:0.07, out:0.07, past:0.07, power:0.07, pretty:0.11, rating:0.07, re:0.12, real:0.12, really:0.07, reviews:0.20, same:0.05, script:0.06, seeing:0.06, seems:0.06, series:0.07, set:0.06, should:0.05, so:0.06, something:0.05, stand:0.07, story:0.04, such:0.16, super:0.05, superhero:0.08, than:0.04, that:0.09, the:0.24, their:0.04, these:0.09, they:0.19, things:0.12, thought:0.11, to:0.10, too:0.04, up:0.04, very:0.04, villain:0.10, was:0.03, where:0.05, which:0.04, why:0.05, with:0.05, written:0.14, year:0.06, yet:0.06, you:0.06"

2012-11-26,"The Marvel's movie The Avengers is an action packed comedy sci-fi movie all in one. It has everything and everyone in it. All of the Marvel characters in one brought together by Nick Fury because Loki stole the Tesseract that was found in the Captain America movie. It has Thor, Hulk, Iron Man, Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Captain America. All the characters are extremely different, which made it very difficult for them to come together as one team against their other worldly foe, Loki. It takes the super heroes to get past their own egos and accept each other's help. It's difficult for the characters to come together because they're personalities are all so different, and they're also used to being the stars by themselves so that makes ten times more difficult to come together. There is a lot of inner conflict with the characters too. To start off with, the inevitable Iron Man. He is still the same Iron Man, a genius with a lot of money and a huge ego. Captain America just has came back from being frozen since the World War II times. He isn't used to all the technology that is used to really enhance the movie. That causes a conflict because Iron Man refers to Captain America as an ""old man"". Then there's Thor who is Loki's brother, there's more conflict. He comes to help because he is against his brothers antics. Loki believes that a world shouldn't have freedom like ours does. He comes to be the ruler and demands it. Then there's Natasha or the Black Widow, to me the typical woman in a super hero movie. She's almost seductive. They have her in tight clothing and she's manipulative. I am surprised that she can hold her own. I figured they would have made her more of a damsel in distress because she is the only woman in the movie really. Her friend Hawkeye becomes under Loki's spell trying to defend Loki from getting the Tesseract. He ends up having to fight Natasha and then comes out of the spell the help in the end. Then there's Hulk who has been trying to hide and stay away pretty much from people so he can keep calm. He hates becoming the Hulk, but when he does, he doesn't care who or what is in his way. He fights the other characters and tries to hurt them without really being aware.Disregarding all of the conflict the characters all come together in the end to take on Loki in the typical attack area I feel for a superhero movie, New York City. It has to happen in a big city to show the impact that it had on the movie. All around the quality of the movie is amazing. The way all the movies were tied together really worked.

2012-04-28,"""The Avengers"" is a great exercise in the art of fantasy movie-making. Its exemplary and superior production value, great performance by a stellar cast all portraying iconic superheroes, clever and witty dialogues (albeit with some nonchalant sarcasm thrown by RDJ as the charismatic and philanthropic billionaire with an obsession for high end technology and sophisticated gadgets), superb pacing nary a monotonous moment, adequate and sufficient background information for the uninitiated (those who haven't seen Thor, Captain America, The Incredible Hulk & The Iron Man franchise) but not overly cumbersome in its flashback of the introductory sequences, magnificent cinematography and mesmerizing VFX, profusely suitable background score without unnecessary cacophony and a brilliant, tight-knit plot giving each and every character enough time and screen presence to develop their respective characters, makes this as the best movie of 2012 by far without any hyperbole and on par with Batman:Dark Knight as possibly the greatest Superhero Movie, comprising of a heavy hitting ensemble cast delivering undoubtedly MARVEL's finest effort till date. Director Joss Whedon has done an exceptional and brilliant job. A must watch movie, which is surely going to be an Epic. It's an amazing movie full of heart, gravitas, emotion and depth. The On-screen chemistry between all the lead characters is uncanny and unparalleled. 10/10, a must watch for every Hollywood movie buff & Superhero aficionado.",10.0,2012-04,Saturday,"10:0.15, 2012:0.09, all:0.07, amazing:0.07, america:0.05, an:0.19, and:0.37, any:0.07, as:0.12, avengers:0.04, batman:0.10, be:0.04, best:0.05, between:0.08, brilliant:0.20, but:0.04, by:0.16, captain:0.05, cast:0.15, character:0.06, characters:0.10, dark:0.09, depth:0.11, director:0.08, done:0.08, each:0.06, end:0.07, enough:0.08, ensemble:0.11, epic:0.10, every:0.14, far:0.08, for:0.11, franchise:0.11, full:0.10, giving:0.10, going:0.08, great:0.10, greatest:0.11, has:0.05, haven:0.10, high:0.09, hollywood:0.11, hulk:0.05, in:0.07, incredible:0.08, iron:0.05, is:0.09, it:0.03, its:0.13, job:0.08, joss:0.06, knight:0.09, makes:0.08, making:0.09, man:0.05, marvel:0.05, moment:0.10, movie:0.20, must:0.16, not:0.04, of:0.15, on:0.09, performance:0.10, plot:0.07, screen:0.14, seen:0.07, sequences:0.09, some:0.05, superhero:0.12, superheroes:0.07, the:0.30, their:0.06, this:0.03, thor:0.05, those:0.08, time:0.05, to:0.06, watch:0.12, whedon:0.06, which:0.06, who:0.06, with:0.11, without:0.16, witty:0.10"
2012-05-05,"The Avengers is the first of it's kind, to have several movies as a build up. While some of the past movies starring the individual heroes, ranged from good to bad, The Avengers is supposed to be the climax of those movies. After seeing it, I was left a bit empty minded. Although I felt entertained throughout most of the movie, the lack of depth got to me several times. Don't get me wrong, it's not because the story is bad, as a matter of fact, it's better than most ""we-gotta-save-the-world"" stories involving superheroes. But where The Avengers fails, is when it comes to getting the audience out on the edge of their seats. You never really believe that they actually might fail, and it might be because this movie was aimed at an mainstream audience, that darker themes were left out. After superhero movies like Zack Snyder's ""Watchmen"" (which mixed, ideologies/politics with other deep themes) and Nolan's Batman franchise , The Avengers feels more like a well-made CGI orgy, with funny moments, amidst a story that fails to capture you.

2012-04-29,"I have no idea how Joss Whedon has made this film work. Not only does this work, but this is one of the best superhero films I've ever seen. Surprisingly the script isn't as biased towards Iron Man as I thought it would be and every character gets a good amount of screen time and their chance to shine. Black Widow and Hawkeye more than hold their own and they aren't just in the background whilst the other superheroes dominate the screen and have all the action, Widow and Hawkeye do some unbelievably awesome things, and are crucial to the story. The dialogue is consistently witty and hilarious, every character gets to deliver a good punchline before the film is up. The final battle in Manhattan lasts a good half an hour at least, and I didn't want it to end, the action was of an epic scope and was absolutely jaw dropping. But the real surprise and best part of this film by far is the Hulk. After 2 so- so films they FINALLY got the Hulk right, and dare I say it, he's my favourite avenger after this, and this will probably be the case for most of you when you leave the theatre. This film was action packed, but it wasn't Transformers, this film had heart, intelligent dialogue and a cast of brilliant actors playing conflicting egos and colourful characters. Every actor is spot on in their respective roles, Tom Hiddleston makes for an excellent villain playing Loki, Thor's brother, and Robert Downey Jr. is much better here than he was in Iron Man 2. The only problem I really had with it was that in the middle it dragged on ever so slightly, but this was forgotten by the time the credits rolled. It has to be said though, if you haven't seen any of the Marvel films before this, you won't have any idea what's going on, and you probably won't really care for the film until the last hour or so kicks in.

2012-04-30,"The First question- Does 'The Avengers' is a film of six superheroes? Answer is NO. The movie is heavily based on the power and skills of IRON MAN and later followed by Hulk; all other characters are just supporting characters adding no extra flavor to remember. Since Captain America, Hawkeye & Natasha don't have super powers they lacked the status of being a superhero as far as avengers is concerned. Even the possibility of emotional connects between Clint Barton (Hawkeye) and Natasha was missing. Also Steve Rogers(Captain America) was struggling to make a presence with other super powers.If one has to term The Avengers as Ironman 3 than it would not be possibly wrong because from the beginning to the climax it's he who holds the film either by his action or style or the dialogues (some of them are really cool). The auto removal of his iron-suit by robotic machines was kool and in a scene where Loki pushed him from the heights, the way his Iron suit came, auto activated and became his body-suit was awesome. Thou Hulk was entertaining but he came into his 'Smashing Avatar' only after half the way movie has past. The way he beaten up the 'Loki' after his comments of being a God was really enjoyable But Joss Whedon, the director could have done better to balance out the movie in terms of introducing equally capable superheroes. Also first half of the movie gradually reaches to boredom with the introduction of superheroes; it's only in the second half that excitement moved to the next level. When we talk about visual effects, cinematography, production value, 3D version or soundtrack all are good and worth praising. Regarding performances its again all the good humor punches goes along with Ironman which makes you smile followed by Hulk. Tom Hiddlestone as Loki and Scarlett Johansson as Natasha were impressive. Rest all were limited in role to mention.Overall it's a good weekend watch especially for Ironman and Hulk Fans but may not live up to the hype created.

2012-05-14,"The amount of hype and praise this movie has gotten is out of hand. It's simply a blockbuster action-movie with superheroes. The plot is easy to follow; bad man wants to take over the Earth for some reason, gets help from aliens to do this, superheroes stop him/them. Of course, this is a bit general, and yes I know the names etc of all these people (beings?). Having had separate movies for many of these heroes (Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, The Incredible Hulk), we know these superheroes, their character and motives if you will. Not all the audience will have seen the previous movies, but it's not exactly a difficult story to follow, and we have seen the same plot 10000 times before, in different variations and in different mediums (books, comic-books, films etc).You guys could see the movie or read about the whole synopsis right here, because I can't bother telling it in detail. Anyway, point is this; if you want to see a summer, blockbuster action-movie with lots of eye candy, then you have discovered the right movie. It's fun, enjoyable and with lots of action, naturally. If you're looking for a great story though, you might have to look somewhere else. There's really no surprising twists or complexity, no fear for the well-being of any of the characters, and in short, not a really interesting story to tell. All the action-scenes are fun etc, but if an alien species invaded us, I would assume that they would have more potent weapons than some laser guns and huge fish-like robots that crash into buildings in Manhatten. Really, a demi-god like Loki and an advanced alien species are content with ravaging Manhatten a bit? Seems like we humans have better weapons alone in the atomic bomb, because one of those was enough to stop them. Yeah, and we have superheroes, three of which are severely underpowered and I don't understand why they were even there (Black Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America). Lame.

2023-04-06,"At a S. H. I. E. L. D. facility researching the power source known as the Tesseract, Director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) oversees the research being conducted by Erik Selvig (Steelan Skarsgard) with the Tesseract seeing some unusual activity. Eventually the Tesseract brings forth Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who has acquired a staff that gives him substantial power and uses it to steal the Tesseract and take control of Selvig and S. H. I. E. L. D. agent Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). In response to the threat posed Fury sends agent Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) to recruit Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) due to his expertise in Gamma Radiation being necessary in tracking the Tesseract and also brings in Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and the recently revived Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) to assist in a battle which also sees the return of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) who comes to stop his brother Loki.The Avengers is a 2012 superhero film and the concluding chapter to the first phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The amount of buildup leading into the Avengers was nothing short of astounding only made even more so when you consider the hurdles this series went through to get to this point. While the MCU had been planned in advance, unlike the comic books it was based upon which had to rely on coordinating the artists, writers, and editors, the films had all that in addition to budgets, casts, and general feasibility with the noted departure of Edward Norton as Bruce Banner following disagreements over 2008's The Incredible Hulk which ended up being downplayed in terms of its significance to the overall universe, and uncertainty that Scarlet Johansson would even return as Black Widow with a back-up script featuring the inclusion of The Wasp briefly considered. However following re-writes by director Joss Whedon that elaborated on Zak Penn's original script, the script and cast was set including a soft relaunch of the Hulk character with Mark Ruffalo stepping in for Norton. Upon release the film garnered the best receives of the series since the original Iron Man and became a massive hit too with a $200 million opening weekend in the United States that carried it to $600 million domestically and $1.5 million worldwide that most likely gave Paramount massive sellers remorse for only taking a little over $100 million for distribution of Avengers and Iron Man 3....whoops. All these years later now free of the buildup and hype that propelled it to blockbuster status, does The Avengers still hold up? In short, yes it does.The movie does a good job of including and paying off all the characters and plot threads established over the previous films with every character getting their chance to shine even seemingly minor characters like Hawkeye and Black Widow who didn't get to do much in their debuts in Thor and Iron Man 2 respectively, but do feel like they're allowed to make more of an impression this time around and get some solid standout moments despite being alongside their powered colleagues. Robert Downey Jr. Is really good as Tony Stark, Chris Hemsworth remains good as Thor, and Chris Evans is still as effortlessly likable as Captain America and his traditional values where he fought more overtly evil antagonists are contrasted well against a world with more shades of grey to it and is probably one of the reasons why Captain America's movies tended to be the best in this franchise. The movie also gives some great moments to its supporting cast including Clark Gregg's welcome return as Agent Coulson, Jeremy Renner and Scarlet Johansson get some fun moments as Hawkeye and Black Widow, and Mark Ruffalo gets a fantastic introduction as Bruce Banner/Hulk with some solid pathos from the character as well as some genuinely amusing humorous moments especially in the climax. Loki is also a solid antagonist who is wonderfully despicable embracing his ""trickster"" persona as someone who has considered every possible angle and wants his adversaries to know it. There is the occasional gaffe in storytelling such as with Loki's ""partners"" purposefully kept off screen for the sake of laying groundwork for more sequels and I wasn't quite sure how Thor found out about the Chitahuri (or even their name for that matter) but these are minor nitpicks in a movie that delivers everywhere it should.The Avengers is the gold standard for modern ""cinematic universes"" and many have tried to copy its formula to only modest success if at all (I'm sure we all remember the Dark Universe...oh wait, no we don't). The Avengers does a good job of balancing many moving parts and characters and feels like a well worth it pay off to the films that preceded it while also laying the groundwork for what's to come.",9.0,2023-04,Thursday,"2012:0.03, about:0.02, against:0.03, agent:0.11, all:0.06, also:0.10, america:0.05, amount:0.04, an:0.02, and:0.29, are:0.03, around:0.03, as:0.19, at:0.03, avengers:0.08, back:0.03, banner:0.08, battle:0.03, be:0.01, been:0.02, being:0.10, best:0.04, black:0.09, blockbuster:0.03, brings:0.07, brother:0.03, bruce:0.08, but:0.02, by:0.04, captain:0.06, cast:0.05, character:0.06, characters:0.05, chris:0.10, cinematic:0.07, come:0.02, comes:0.03, comic:0.02, dark:0.03, didn:0.03, director:0.05, do:0.04, does:0.09, don:0.02, downey:0.04, especially:0.03, evans:0.05, even:0.08, every:0.05, evil:0.03, fantastic:0.03, feel:0.03, feels:0.03, film:0.03, films:0.07, first:0.02, for:0.10, found:0.04, franchise:0.04, from:0.02, fun:0.02, fury:0.05, get:0.08, gets:0.03, getting:0.04, good:0.07, great:0.02, had:0.06, has:0.03, have:0.01, hawkeye:0.07, he:0.02, hemsworth:0.05, hiddleston:0.03, him:0.03, his:0.09, how:0.02, however:0.03, hulk:0.05, hype:0.03, if:0.02, in:0.19, incredible:0.03, into:0.02, iron:0.07, is:0.08, it:0.10, its:0.07, jackson:0.03, jeremy:0.06, job:0.05, johansson:0.08, joss:0.02, jr:0.04, know:0.02, like:0.05, little:0.03, loki:0.08, made:0.02, make:0.02, man:0.06, many:0.05, mark:0.07, marvel:0.02, mcu:0.03, moments:0.11, more:0.09, most:0.02, movie:0.03, movies:0.02, much:0.02, nick:0.03, no:0.02, norton:0.07, nothing:0.03, now:0.02, of:0.18, off:0.07, on:0.03, one:0.01, only:0.06, or:0.02, original:0.07, out:0.02, over:0.07, overall:0.03, parts:0.04, plot:0.02, point:0.03, power:0.07, previous:0.03, probably:0.03, quite:0.03, re:0.06, really:0.02, renner:0.06, robert:0.04, ruffalo:0.07, samuel:0.03, scarlett:0.03, screen:0.02, script:0.09, seeing:0.03, series:0.07, set:0.03, short:0.07, should:0.03, since:0.03, so:0.02, some:0.11, stark:0.05, still:0.05, stop:0.03, such:0.03, superhero:0.02, sure:0.06, take:0.03, tesseract:0.18, that:0.12, the:0.48, their:0.07, there:0.02, these:0.04, they:0.02, this:0.04, thor:0.07, through:0.03, time:0.02, to:0.25, tom:0.03, tony:0.05, too:0.02, universe:0.09, up:0.05, wait:0.03, wants:0.04, was:0.04, wasn:0.03, we:0.04, well:0.05, went:0.03, what:0.02, whedon:0.02, when:0.02, where:0.02, which:0.06, while:0.05, who:0.10, why:0.03, widow:0.09, with:0.11, world:0.02, worth:0.03, would:0.02, years:0.03, yes:0.03, you:0.01"
2012-06-07,"I don't believe anyone wouldn't enjoy it and so I would recommend it, but at the same time, I felt the urge to write a cautionary review to try and add to the expulsion of some of the 9/10 star hype (and the ridiculous 1 star reviews).I felt a little tired the night I went to watch this film, but since I'd booked tickets I went anyway. I think this might be why I came out feeling it wasn't awe-inspiring. My tiredness stopped me from enjoying the non-stop 'conceptual interfaces', the flash and the CGI, when you are less aware of these aspects what is underneath is not as high-concept as is made out. What I found was a slightly bumbling first half and an action-packed second half. I believe if you got this home when it comes out and watch it on an average TV on DVD you wouldn't be as impressed.With so many stories to include there isn't much exploration of any particular area, we have a fair bit of time dedicated to learning a little about each character but given it does nothing more than glance across the surface, why bother at all? Why not give us more in-depth insight into the 'mechanics' of the how and why, a creative discussion on, well, something - anything and let the audience infer the rest by showing us in character reactions etc. Then let the second half let-rip.I'm no film buff but it seems to me that when you stop and actually compare films of IMDb's claim to be equal in calibre - we have The Avengers being better than Taxi Driver, Alien and only 0.2 behind Empire Strikes Back - obviously you can't really compare the films because they're so different but it's a point about the ratings.In the characters we see half interesting and half one-dimensional, with a strange amount of time, relatively speaking, being given to aspects that don't really push the film forward. Sorry for the lack of pro-critique - like I said, I'm not a film buff.I didn't know this was a Joss Whedon film until after I watched it and this makes sense - a lot of his stuff is amazing and deep, subtle and telling, yet then you get other work like Dollhouse which falls down by picking the wrong kind of area to focus on.It's worth a watch though, and if you like comic book films like Iron Man (obviously) you're going to enjoy this.

2012-05-11,"Storytelling as an art? What's that? And, who cares, anyway? When Hollywood makes tons of money off of bad movies, then where's the financial incentive to make decent films? 2012 is turning out to the worst year in decades (and I have been going to the movies for over 40 years, so that's saying something) for really bad blockbusters: first, Hunger Games; next,Dark Shadows; and now The Avengers!I am so sick and tired of New York City, specifically the island of Manhattan, being attacked in the movies. Hello! It was attacked in real life only a little over 10 years ago costing the lives of over 3,000+ real people, including my brother's co-worker, wife and unborn child! But what is really despicable is that at the very end of the The Avengers you briefly get to see a real-life news photo from 9/11 mourning the dead. That's just plain, disgusting exploitation! But lets not stop there! At the end of the film we get to briefly hear a local New York State Senator rant about how our Avenger heroes ""wrecked Manhattan."" That our heroes who just risked their lives in a 1,000+ ways are to ""blame"" for all the destruction! Fine! I agree many politicians are real jerks, but to put the letter ""D"" next to this Senator's name speaks volumes about the films real message: Democrats holding elective office are nothing more than ungrateful, winy creeps! That's real cute! I thought Hollywood was sooooooo liberal! If you going to interject politics into a film then why not put a ""R"" after the Senator's name? After all, the Republicans in Congress fought tooth and nail to prevent the establishment of a Federally funded medical fund for First Responders whose health was permanently impaired by breathing in all the toxic waste that was released into the air! The Avengers is also plain boring with the most two-dimensional characters in the history of film making! Sure I wanted the good guys to win! Sure the guys have cute muscles and the gals are all pretty! But, really now, who cares when there is zero character development and the storyline is about as exciting as watching Frosty The Snowman for the tenth time! The last third of the Avengers is nothing more than war porn! I will never watch another super hero movie that has a character from The Avengers as long as I live! Even for free, or if Hollywood offers me a million dollars! Overall, Hollywood has done a decent job with the X-men and the Fanatic Four, but for some reason the right-wing kooks who control the Avenger characters have turned them into nothing more than an exploitative moneymaking machine.

2023-02-11,"The Avengers features an ensemble cast of some of the biggest and best names in Hollywood, including Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man, Chris Evans as Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye just to name a few.The film's writing is excellent, it has a very well-structured and engaging storyline that effectively balances the different characters and subplots in a way many crossover superhero films lack. The film's humor is also noteworthy point for me, with Joss Whedon's signature wit on full display throughout. The action scenes are also visually stunning and exciting, with the special effects and CGI in particular being dazzling.The acting is also fantastic, with each actor bringing their A-game to their respective roles. The chemistry between the cast is magnificent, with the various characters bouncing off of each other in a way that is both entertaining and believable.Overall, in my opinion the Avengers is an excellent superhero film that is sure to enthral with its strong writing, excellent performances, and exciting action scenes.

2012-10-26,"Even with the action packed fighting scenes of numerous superheroes and very clever humor, The Avengers fails to live up to its expectations as being the best superhero movie ever made.Basically, the only people who were acting in the movie were; Captain America, Nick Fury & Black Widow, the rest were there just to fight. Even if that was the soul purpose of the movie, not a lot of work was put into the performance of the main characters, except for the ones mentioned above.Still don't know why Captain America and Hawkeye were casted in the movie, they have no soul importance. Yes, Captain America is inspiring but Marvel could've surely gone with ANYONE else. Maybe wait another year and let the reboot of Spiderman release and cast Spiderman in The Avengers. The only thing that exceed's expectation is the Hulk with its awesome power and dominance (even that was kept very late)There weren't any jaw-dropping action scenes but there were some great laughs when the heroes fought or argued with each other.All in all, it can be called a disappointment, because I really don't think this movie is better than Spiderman or Spiderman 2 or Batman Begins or The Dark Knight or Iron Man or The Incredible Hulk or even Thor. In my opinion, this not the best Marvel movie ever made, the reason to which I think could be that, it was done very hurriedly.

2021-05-10,"Loki attempts to enslave planet Earth.This is an entertaining movie with impressive spectacle and solid character moments.The plot for me is okay, as Loki and the Chitari never truly feel like a plausible threat. However, the character time it gives to various superheroes is exceptionally good.Putting so many comic book characters on the stage at the same time is a difficult concept, but this is done well with some excellent dialogue and creative uses of their powers in various situations. Some of the banter from characters like Black Widow, Iron Man, Loki and Captain America is wonderfully written and delivered.There are some fights that feel a bit forced to bring fanboys fantasies like Thor v Ironman or Thor v Hulk to life. However, they are admittedly fun to watch. What does get a bit much is the sheer volume of hyperkinetic CGI heavy action sequences. They are fantastically designed but for me there is too much of it. Personally I would have replaced some of this with quieter character moments but this is just a matter of taste.It goes without saying that all the visuals are high quality throughout the film. My favourite sequence is the Stuttgart scene, which is beautifully filmed, edited, scored and climaxes with some heroic posturing from the Avengers.When the Hulk goes o the rampage in the Helicarrier, there is a brilliant scene transition from him punching someone through a wall to a shot of Iron Man emerging from a similar shaped hole in a different wall.The climactic battle scene is a massive piece of spectacle and it includes some of the most impressive effects and CGI sequences in recent years. At the risk of sounding like a killjoy, some of the impressive feats of heroism performed by the Avengers do seem like they have been included for the sake of coolness, such as no look shots and other solo moves.'The Avengers' contains a number of solid performances. For me Scarlet Johansson has the most powerful screen presence and Mark Ruffalo makes a perfect Bruce Banner. Robert Downey Jr is as charismatic as ever, whilst Chris Evans, Chris Hemswoth, Samuel L Jackson and Jeremy Renner are all solid.

The Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, and Captain America movies were more enjoyable on their own. I thought it would be great to see all these heroes come together, but I think it really just lead to so many main characters that the audience didn't get a chance to understand any of them individually. Special effects were great, don't get me wrong, and the 3D was cool, but that wasn't enough to save the movie. Storyline was too stretched out. Underwhelming opening.

2023-01-16,"So I recently watched ""The Avengers"" and let me tell you, it was lit. The action scenes were insane and the special effects were on point. But what really stood out to me was the chemistry between the characters, it was like they had been a team for years. I mean sure, As a huge fan, it was amazing to see them share the screen with all these other badass heroes. Overall, I highly recommend checking out ""The Avengers"" if you haven't already. Trust me, you won't regret it.The casting in Avengers is truly exceptional. Each actor effectively embodies their respective character, bringing them to life on screen. Chris Evans portraysals the role of Captain America with a sense of responsibility and gravitas, while Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark/Iron Man is both charming and entertaining. Mark Ruffalo, who plays the Hulk, brings a level of vulnerability and empathy to the character that has never been seen before. Chris Hemsworth, as Thor, seamlessly blends power and humor, and Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is fierce and formidable. But perhaps the stand-out performance is Tom Hiddleston as Loki, who imbues the villain with a charm and intelligence that commands the audience's attention throughout the film.The story of Avengers: Endgame is expertly crafted, weaving together a diverse array of characters and plotlines from the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a cohesive and impactful manner.

2012-06-24,"After hearing my family rave about how incredible, awesome, amazing, blah, blah, blah ... this movie was, my wife and I went to see it. We are HUGE Marvel fans, and we were excited to see the movie. Our expectations simply were not met relative to all the hype, and this film is not worthy of an 8.6 rating. It's a very good movie, but not great by any means. Here's the good and the bad.The Good: The special effects were outstanding as you would expect. The acting was also nicely done. The script was somewhat well paced, although we both felt it started fairly slowly. The movie did had some of the funniest moments of any super hero film I've seen. The storyline was OK, but that brings me to the bad.The Bad: The storyline was just OK. I won't spoil the movie, but suffice it to say the anti-heroes motivations were somewhat silly to me. That said, it follows (somewhat) to the comic storyline, so the plot was never really all that interesting to begin with. The actors and directors did the best they could with the plot, but I was never pulled into the story that deeply, nor did it strike any emotional connection or interest for me. It was just a great action movie that was well acted with a reasonable script.Avengers is a very good action film, and worthy of seeing on the big screen.

2012-06-02,"""Marvel's The Avengers"" deserves full credit for it's dynamic execution in bringing the Marvel cast together, as it was a very well-structured and firmly put-together blockbuster by the exciting character-driven filmmaker, Joss Whedon. The clash and the interactions of each Marvel hero, and the development of this was exuberant, witty, and simply hilarious. As the film progressed into the action tone and the all-out, explosive warfare in New York City, the teamwork and building chemistry couldn't be anymore dynamic, and yet still humorous from Whedon's continuous comic relief of the combination of these contrasting superheroes. Although, after all this popcorn fun, simple but vital flaws remain.The score of this massively anticipated Marvel feature should've had a magical and intense sound similar to ""The Lord of the Rings"" or Christopher Nolan's Batman films. Instead the score failed to connect, as it lacked in ""pure epicness"" and beauty, and ultimately the film lost connection with one of the most important aspects in a film. Not only did the sound and score of the film not work, but the very simple story was exposed from the lack of depth in the telling of the story. This ultimately made the film feel smaller and weaker than it should be. With these small, yet very important, aspects of the film, frustratingly, not executed well, instead of ""Marvel's The Avengers"" ending on a high-note, it ends having zero connection with the story and characters, except Mark Ruffalo's brilliant interpretation of The Hulk, because the lack of connection from the score and the lack of depth in the storytelling ultimately wore on everything else that appeared on screen. What lack of connection in a film leads to is a forgettable movie because if a film doesn't connect and stick with someone, how can that film possibly be remembered. But it's ""Marvel's The Avengers,"" how can that be forgotten? Very easily. The concept won't be forgotten, nor will Joss Whedon's incredible character-portrayal of each superhero be forgotten, but it will be the anticipation and the potential brilliance in the other huge motion pictures in 2012 such as ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" and ""The Hobbit"" which will make ""The Avenger's"" be that film where everyone thinks, ""what was that movie that came out earlier this year, it was a huge movie...oh yeah, The Avengers how could I possibly forget that."" It's not because the film wasn't good, it was an awesome and intense blockbuster to watch, but it was the little things that left the film slightly over par.Simplifying it down, ""Marvel's The Avenger's"" was a fun film and one for everyone to see and really deserves high praise for it's execution of it's characters. Although, as glorious as it looked, it unfortunately did not sound nearly as good as I wanted it too. Yet, the film is still easily likable to any viewer because there is so much to like about in the excitement of this film.",7.0,2012-06,Saturday,"2012:0.04, about:0.02, action:0.02, after:0.03, all:0.03, although:0.08, an:0.02, and:0.25, any:0.03, as:0.14, avenger:0.08, avengers:0.07, awesome:0.03, batman:0.04, be:0.15, because:0.11, blockbuster:0.08, brilliant:0.04, but:0.08, by:0.02, came:0.04, can:0.05, cast:0.03, character:0.05, characters:0.04, comic:0.03, could:0.03, couldn:0.05, dark:0.04, depth:0.09, development:0.04, did:0.06, doesn:0.04, down:0.04, each:0.06, else:0.04, everyone:0.07, everything:0.03, exciting:0.04, feel:0.04, film:0.30, films:0.03, for:0.05, from:0.06, full:0.04, fun:0.06, good:0.04, had:0.03, having:0.04, hero:0.03, high:0.08, how:0.08, huge:0.08, hulk:0.02, if:0.02, in:0.14, incredible:0.04, instead:0.09, into:0.03, is:0.04, it:0.23, joss:0.05, knight:0.04, left:0.05, like:0.02, little:0.03, made:0.03, make:0.03, mark:0.03, marvel:0.16, most:0.03, movie:0.04, much:0.03, new:0.03, not:0.09, of:0.24, on:0.06, one:0.04, only:0.03, or:0.02, other:0.02, out:0.05, over:0.03, put:0.04, really:0.02, ruffalo:0.03, screen:0.03, see:0.02, should:0.07, simple:0.09, simply:0.04, so:0.02, still:0.06, story:0.07, such:0.04, superhero:0.03, superheroes:0.03, than:0.03, that:0.12, the:0.57, there:0.02, these:0.06, things:0.04, this:0.08, to:0.09, together:0.05, too:0.03, ve:0.03, very:0.10, was:0.13, wasn:0.04, watch:0.03, well:0.05, what:0.05, whedon:0.08, where:0.03, which:0.03, will:0.07, with:0.07, witty:0.04, won:0.05, work:0.03, year:0.04, yet:0.12, york:0.04"
2012-12-10,"Finally the Marvel Franchise reveals it's coup de grace and it's everything that we hoped for. Before I totally kiss this movie's butt for a while I'm going to delve into the negatives first.Just a warning the first 25 minutes are a little slow, which is to be expected when telling such a large story. Lord of the Rings needed a whole movie to build up to the adventure to put it into context. Some of Loki's dialogue is a little hard to understand at times because of the Norse language dialect, but that's easily fixed with second viewings. Other than that and some nitpicks the movie delivers.This is the movie we all made playing with our toys as a kid. Wheedon has done a fantastic job and I really don't think this movie could've worked as well without him. All the characters fit in this movie. I never thought a conversation between Loki and Nick Fury would work on screen but it does. Every character gets to shine in this movie. At time it's a Black Widow movie, then an Ironman movie, then a Thor movie, then a Captain America movie it all just fits perfectly. This movie has the best editing I've seen all year and some of the best acting to go with it. This movie is a culmination of several geek movies in one. It's got the ear turning and self reflection of Scott Pilgrim with the ensemble aspect of Star Trek (2009) with great dialogue. I'm going to say character a lot because that's the focus. The story is a little weak because it comes second to the characters. I've always described superhero movies are character pieces with big budgets. A lot of people complained that it's a comedy or that it's just a loud mindless movie with explosions like Transformers. Since when does having great humor make something a comedy? All the humor is in the witty dialogue and a few physical gags which are hilarious and also unique to the characters. And Wheedon adds lots of little subtle setups to the ending to make the movie more cohesive and smarter than it is. It's not a bad story it's just a simple character driven one. The only superhero movie I know that has more emphasis on story is The Dark Knight, but this blows that out of the water. 6 heroes are better than one. That's why Lord of The Rings, Star Trek, and Toy Story are so great. The Team or The Ensemble. There are so many ways this movie could've been ruined. Maybe they got the writing right, and the action is choreographed well but is filmed with shaky cam or is incoherent. All the action scenes in this movie are great and easy on the eyes and even have lots of character in them. The best scene in this movie is when the avengers are all arguing in a room. And the acting is the greatest. I still have a hard time wrestling with who was my favorite actor in this.

2013-12-10,"The Avengers was very well waited among Marvel comic book fans and general superhero fans. When it comes to delving deeply into the minds or motivations of the film's other, previously established heroes, he abstains all together. And maybe that's for the best. Even with 2 hours and 24 minutes to kill, there's precious little time for him to offer remedial courses in Marvel mythology. Those who haven't done their homework and watched the previous films still should be able to follow the basics, but they almost certainly will be left scratching their heads from time to time. In the mix among stars doing battle are Scarlett Johansson, who plays the Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner as archery expert Hawkeye. There were a lot of high expectations for this film and on many levels it delivers, while on few others it disappoints. Since writer-director Joss Whedon was dealing with so many big-name stars, like Robert Downey Jr., who reprises his role as Iron Man, Gwenyth Paltrow as Pepper Potts and Mark Ruffalo, who takes over the role of Dr. Bruce Banner a.k.a. the Hulk, there's just not enough screen time to fit everyone adequately in.For those who have kept up with it, though, The Avengers is a nice payoff to a sprawling and ambitious filmmaking strategy, and one whose blueprint can be counted on to change the way major studios approach their superhero franchises for years to come.

I won't deny that Stan Lee created a diverse variety of do-gooders in the Marvel Universe. ""The Avengers"" (not to be confused with the 1960s TV series) is entertaining enough. It's nothing special - much of it is sensory overload - but it's nothing that it doesn't pretend to be. Loki is the common suave but malevolent villain. He could trick anyone into thinking that he's a decent person. This movie will definitely please the Leonard Hofstadters, Sheldon Coopers, Howard Wolowitzes and Raj Koothrapalis of the world.It was a pleasant surprise to see that one of the people in the World Security Council got played by Jenny Agutter (the nurse in ""An American Werewolf in London"").

The actors were all on point and did a great job, I did miss Edward Norton in the film but mark ruffalo definitely won me over and was very pleased with his work in this film. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a action packed film full of drama and chaos! Robert Downey Jr. Is probably my favorite actor and if not he's very high on my list but the commitment and work put in from the entire crew of production and filming members is one for the books. I'm really looking toward to seeing a second part to this movie and I'm very confident when I say that I know it will be great! If you know anything about any of these comic book heroes then I'm sure you didn't need to see any movies such as the Iron Man trilogy, Thor, Captain America, or the Hulk to understand this film...

To call this film an utter triumph would be a gross under-exaggeration. Containing some of the best action sequences ever captured on film, the wittiest and most hilarious humor I have seen, and probably the greatest chemistry between both characters and actors in cinema.

2012-08-18,"First of all I must admit that I am not much particularly a fan of superheroes in general, but I have seen the movies leading up to this, simply because they were available and I had the time. And I had read up on the hype around this movie, so I might as well give it a go as well.And as a fairly non-superhero kind of guy, well I must say that ""The Avengers"" was one interesting and exciting ride of an action movie. The story was, for me at least, rather slow paced up to the point where the alien army came through the portal. Sure, it was building up character and getting the various characters introduced properly to those not having seen any of the prior movies.The effects in ""The Avengers"" were top notch, as to be expected from a movie of this caliber. Lots of really great effects and visuals. However, when that aircraft carrier ship started to transform and then fly, I was ready to turn off the movie. That was just silly. But I decided to keep watching and look past that one particular horrendous scene.However, one thing did make me wonder, with all the destruction in New York, you didn't see a single civilian getting hit or killed in any way, that was just stupid, especially with so many people living there. In fact, you only saw very few deaths throughout the entire movie, which was sort of lame.Another thing puzzled me, when Bruce Banner turned into The Hulk for the first time in the movie, he was out of control, smashing everything and everyone in sight. But somehow he magically overcame that and was fully in control the second time. That just seemed very implausible and sort of contradicted what we had just seen at the first transformation.And as with the previous Marvel movies with these characters, they had some great performances to the movie. I think that it was actually Tom Hiddleston who plays Loki who put on the most memorable performance in the movie and stood out the most.""The Avengers"" was good entertainment, even for an anti-superhero guy like myself.

And despite the dull NYC ""big finale"", there was some exciting Summer spectacle herein (mostly in the fight scenes). But my favorite parts were during the quieter moments, when all the noise and CGI were dialed down. The movie works best when it's a bunch of competing heroes thrown together in a room.

2012-12-10,"You can think I'm jumping on the bandwagon or whatever you want - this movie was AMAZING. I would give it a 10 out of 10 if Cobie Smulders hadn't been so poorly miscast. Go back to Ted, Robin, you don't belong here. I would be hard pressed to find anything else wrong with this movie.The best scenes are not when the Avengers are working together to fight the enemy, it's when they're fighting each other - with words (hilarious!) or with weapons (bad***!). Some might say the beginning of this movie starts out too slow and there isn't enough action - I'd say they are dead wrong. Dead wrong. This is a movie that doesn't insult the audience by assuming that all they want are things to go crash and boom. This is a movie that cares about developing their characters and cares about an actual storyline. Sure, they're all superheros, but they're all also human. Don't worry though, there's still plenty of action to go around and each of the characters in this movie pulls his (and her!) own weight.My only piece of advice is to first see Captain America, Iron Man (at least the first), and Thor. Especially Thor since the entire premise of this movie is based on Thor's brother Loki - Tom Hiddleston is RIDICULOUSLY amazing in this movie. Avengers does a good job of catching you up to speed if you haven't seen these other movies (or read the comic books, which I admittedly haven't) but I would still recommend seeing them.Bottom Line: If I had the money, I'd be paying to see this movie in the theater every day.",9.0,2012-12,Monday,"10:0.11, about:0.09, action:0.07, all:0.09, also:0.05, amazing:0.11, america:0.04, an:0.04, and:0.13, anything:0.07, are:0.13, around:0.07, at:0.04, audience:0.07, avengers:0.06, back:0.06, bad:0.06, be:0.07, been:0.05, beginning:0.08, best:0.04, brother:0.07, but:0.06, by:0.04, can:0.04, captain:0.04, characters:0.07, comic:0.05, day:0.08, does:0.05, doesn:0.07, don:0.10, each:0.10, else:0.08, enough:0.06, entire:0.08, especially:0.06, every:0.05, fight:0.06, fighting:0.07, find:0.07, first:0.09, give:0.06, go:0.16, good:0.04, had:0.05, hard:0.07, haven:0.16, her:0.08, here:0.06, hiddleston:0.06, his:0.04, if:0.12, in:0.08, iron:0.04, is:0.12, isn:0.07, it:0.05, job:0.06, least:0.07, line:0.07, loki:0.04, man:0.04, might:0.08, money:0.08, movie:0.24, movies:0.04, my:0.04, not:0.03, of:0.16, on:0.07, only:0.05, or:0.12, other:0.09, out:0.08, own:0.06, re:0.20, read:0.08, recommend:0.08, say:0.11, scenes:0.05, see:0.08, seeing:0.07, seen:0.05, since:0.07, so:0.04, some:0.04, still:0.11, storyline:0.08, sure:0.07, that:0.08, the:0.26, theater:0.08, their:0.04, them:0.04, there:0.08, these:0.05, they:0.19, things:0.07, think:0.05, this:0.22, thor:0.12, though:0.06, to:0.18, together:0.05, tom:0.06, too:0.05, up:0.04, want:0.13, was:0.03, when:0.09, which:0.05, with:0.09, would:0.13, wrong:0.24, you:0.17"
2012-08-21,"The Avengers has been one of the most anticipated movies of the year, arguably of the decade. When so many super heroes are in one movie, the fans and nerds will flock; and that's what they did. I would say that it did not disappoint. Mostly. Looking back on the experience, I have to say that the quality of The Avengers was surprisingly poor. the acting really didn't stand out with the exception of (guess who) Robert Downey Jr, completely overshadowing the rest of the cast. The dialogue, much like the acting was really skimpy. Most of the general conversation felt like it needed more time spent on it, and it seems most of the work went into the multitude of witty jokes that actually ended up working in their favor.The story, much like the dialogue, felt familiar, and at many times I couldn't help but feel a sense of deja vu in the plot twists and the action scenes. The pacing in the story was also off, and in between the intense and exciting action sequences I felt bored of the cheap, although sometimes hilarious dialogue.The characters were actually quite shallow. Individual character development was pretty much non-existent, with the movie focusing more on the relationships between the characters, and even that was shallow.However, all of this aside, The Avengers was actually a good movie. The plain fact is that this movie is absolutely everything that fans wanted, and with that was able to bury most of the problems it had under romping good fun, something that many other movies have tried and failed to do. The Hulk smashed, Iron Man blew stuff up, Captain America bashed the badies, etc. If there was any analogy to describe The Avengers, it would be that it is like UFC. It's kinda cheesy and doesn't take itself too seriously; however when the good guy slams the bad guy, everybody cheers. When Hulk smashed, the crowd erupted. When Loki says some snide comment, there was booing and hissing. The Avengers was not a good FILM, it was merely an exhibition of the superheroes power, and that was exactly what the fans came to see, and I can appreciate that.",7.0,2012-08,Tuesday,"able:0.06, absolutely:0.06, acting:0.08, action:0.05, actually:0.14, all:0.02, also:0.03, although:0.05, america:0.03, an:0.03, and:0.21, any:0.04, are:0.02, at:0.03, avengers:0.11, back:0.04, bad:0.04, be:0.02, been:0.03, between:0.08, but:0.02, came:0.05, can:0.03, captain:0.03, cast:0.04, character:0.03, characters:0.05, couldn:0.06, development:0.05, dialogue:0.15, did:0.07, didn:0.04, do:0.04, doesn:0.05, downey:0.03, even:0.03, everything:0.04, exciting:0.05, experience:0.05, fact:0.05, fans:0.13, feel:0.04, felt:0.15, film:0.02, fun:0.04, good:0.10, guy:0.10, had:0.03, has:0.03, have:0.04, help:0.06, heroes:0.03, however:0.09, hulk:0.05, if:0.03, in:0.09, individual:0.06, into:0.03, iron:0.03, is:0.05, it:0.15, itself:0.05, jr:0.04, like:0.10, loki:0.03, looking:0.05, man:0.03, many:0.11, more:0.06, most:0.13, movie:0.07, movies:0.05, much:0.09, not:0.04, of:0.22, off:0.04, on:0.07, one:0.04, other:0.03, out:0.03, plot:0.04, power:0.05, pretty:0.04, quite:0.05, really:0.06, rest:0.05, robert:0.03, say:0.07, scenes:0.03, see:0.03, seems:0.05, sense:0.05, sequences:0.05, so:0.03, some:0.03, something:0.04, stand:0.06, story:0.06, stuff:0.06, super:0.04, superheroes:0.04, take:0.04, that:0.22, the:0.61, their:0.03, there:0.05, they:0.03, this:0.03, time:0.03, times:0.05, to:0.08, too:0.04, up:0.06, was:0.24, went:0.05, were:0.03, what:0.06, when:0.12, who:0.03, will:0.03, with:0.06, witty:0.05, work:0.04, would:0.06, year:0.05"

Who else could have written and directed a film starring Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk and Captain America, but doing them all justice?

2012-04-27,"Consider the wit, brawn and pulse-pounding balls of both Iron Man movies and the spectacular Thor. Now consider the flaws and failings of Captain America, Fury and two incredibly average Hulk flicks. What are you left with? A question: where exactly was in-form writer/director Joss Whedon's Avengers Assemble actually going to go? Down the pan? Or through the roof? Well, guess what? He's only gone and pulled it off. Ever since that teasing Nick Fury advent at the end of the first Iron Man, fans and filmgoers alike have been seeing-out the end credits of all subsequent Marvel flicks in hope of something (anything). What they got was everything. All signs pointed to an assemble, all roads lead to an Avengers movie. 5 years in the making? Try 50 for any Marvel mogul worth their salt will tell you a film's been coming since the early 1960's. And here it is: 4 big-buck franchises rolled into one: Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and Hulk. Robert Downey-Junior, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans and...Mark Ruffolo?! Ed Norton obviously didn't fancy this one but fear not, Hulk nuts, Ruffolo's twitchy turn makes for the best Banner yet. Anyway, throw these four in a room together and you're guaranteed two things; friction and fun. Our heroes square up, square off but in the end...well you can guess where it goes. The story? SHIELD head Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) enlists the fickle four along with Black Widow (Scarlet Johanson) to help save the world from Thor's bad brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Zero points for innovation, then. But if you thought Tony Stark suiting-up for the first-time was the coolest thing you've ever seen. Think again. Skilled sci-fi pen-cum-director Joss Whedon has well and truly arrived with this dizzyingly brilliant blockbuster that's more than the sum of it's fluctuating parts. Believe the hype, Avengers Assemble is a cast-iron hit. It's incredible. It's thunderous. It's furious, beaming, biting and marvellous. But enough puns, let's get down to business.Whedon has approached this four-way fusion in the right way: a strong and balanced emphasis on plot, dialogue and visuals, character development and chemistry. Too many cooks? Hell no. The big-name players work so well with one another it's actually surprising. The sheer sum and sense of one-liners and put-downs are just as memorable as the brutal, in-house beat-downs. Which is saying something when you consider scenes pitting Iron Man and Hulk against Thor are enough to send an entire generation of comic-book geeks into cardiac arrest.Downey-Junior's effortlessly cool turn on the sarci' Stark was always going to be the main lure, here, but to say he outshines his peers would be wrong. It's not all about the billionaire ball-buster. Everyone gets their 15 minutes. Both Hemsworth and Ruffolo (in particular) are bang on. Even the out-of-touch Cap' chips in with a few big, cheesy shots and Hiddleston's creepy demigod makes for a sharp villain.Granted, Whedon's tongue-in-cheek ethos and slapstick-like approach means the Avengers was never going to measure up to any of Nolan's Batman films. How many comic-book films (or films, in general) do!? Which is why there's not much point even trying to compare this breath-snatching Marvel muster to Nolan's Dark Knight rebirth. It's a kick-ass popcorn movie for young and old. Nothing more.That said, this hulking 142 minute feature is a stimulating affair with a freehold on the brash and the flash and the down-right hilarious. It's an absolute blast. Wildly entertaining, ridiculously awesome, the Avengers' is everything it should be: over-the-top, funny, cool, funny, loud, exciting, electric and did I mention funny!? Best comic book movie ever? No. Best Marvel production ever? Yeeeeee...no. X-Men: First Class still has that one tied-up but for such a question to prompt a pause for thought says an awful lot. Whedon's Assemble may not be the best superhero film out there but it is the funniest and probably the most entertaining. Definitely the coolest.Sure, there may be a limit to how many times you can watch superheroes kick the crap out of one and all. But you won't mind too much. Popcorn cinema doesn't get much better than this. Joss Whedon and co. have kicked this year's comic-book-busters off with a bang.

2013-03-25,"I was fully expecting to not like this movie because I haven't thought much of Iron Man or Captain America movies, but the story behind this film was better than I expected. Also, you need to have seen previous superhero movies to get this movie, especially Thor. Loki, Thor's evil brother, comes to earth to lead an alien invasion and it's up to the superheros to stop him. The Black Widow and Hawkeye have very little to do and could have been left out. So basically, the heroes are chasing Loki around until the invasion when there is a huge battle at the end. The battle was cool with cool computer effects.

Jackson) of S.H.I.E.L.D. brings together a team of super humans to form The Avengers to help save the Earth from Loki and his army.I want to first address the IMDb rating on this film. Currently, it sits at an 8.3 and is said to be the 140th greatest film of all time. Now, no matter how good you think it is, does anyone seriously believe it is one of the greatest films ever made? I mean, really? I grew up reading comic books, so the films are a bit of a different experience for me than they are for others. I think the movies have the comic fans as their biggest base, which is good, because otherwise several references and foreshadowings are going to be missed. If you do not know who Hawkeye is, for example, it may cause you to wonder why a government agent is jumping around and shooting off strange arrows.My biggest concern was: how do you make a movie about a team where the individuals have such strong personalities?

2012-08-28,"The movie was absolute trash. Horrible scripts, least menacing villain ever, no chemistry between the actors, and mundane story line. The movie was immensely over hyped and definitely does not deserve anything near a 8.5 rating. Its alright as a kids movie. It does not come anywhere near the unprecedented standards set by the dark knight or for that matter does not even come close to spiderman 2. The movie is often commended for its humor. In my opinion the humor is extremely dry and futile. Nothing special at all, despite its box office success it would have been better off as an animated movie.

I waited in line for 2 hrs to see this movie and was greeted by the surprise appearance of Writer/Director Josh Whedon, stars Chris ""Thor"" Hemsworh Tom ""Loki"" Hiddleston, Clark ""Agent Phil Coulson"", Cobie ""Maria Hill Smulders and Producer Kevin Feige and let me just say ... I would gladly stand in line for another 2 hrs to see it again...The Avengers in one word was ""AMAZING"" Josh Whedon and his cast and crew knocked this movie right out of the ball park and into a whole new cinematic universe !!! The action, humor and story were spot on. The action and characters were ripped right out of the pages and put right onto the screen., everything you love about the comics is there and then some. It was immediately obvious that this movie was made by the fans, for the fans... It dozen't matter if your a fan of comics or cartoons, everyone will find something to like about this movie. Just be prepared for a roller-coaster ride and a a great time at the movies!I have to say when I first heard Mr. Whedon was attached to direct, as a Buffy and Angel fan I was excited., But he succeeded all my expectations and then some. Anyone says you just can't write a good script with this many actors and give them all their own story arc should attend the Josh Whedon school of screen-writing...

2012-04-27,"Could anyone imagine that the likes of Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America(Chris Evans), Hulk(Mark Ruffalo), Thor(Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson), & Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner) would come together for a movie?! Well they do, in The Avengers! The movie opens with a bang, as Loki(Tom Hiddleston) returns to Earth and wreaks havoc at the S.H.I.E.L.D headquarters. Loki steals the Tesseract, an energy source of unlimited potential. He puts Professor Erik Selvig(Stellan Skarsgard) & Hawkeye under his control & leaves with them. After the incident at the headquarters, Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) decides that he has to reignite the Avengers Initiative, a project that had been canceled, only recently. In comes Black Widow aka Natasha Romanoff who starts recruiting superheroes to form The Avengers. First, she recruits Bruce Banner aka the Hulk who, until then, had been hiding in Calcutta, India. S.H.I.E.L.D needs Banner to check the potential of the Tesseract. The new recruit is Captain America who had been frozen for quite some time(these events took place in Captain America: The First Avenger) & woke up after being in a deep slumber for seventy years. After that, S.H.I.E.L.D recruits Tony Stark aka Iron Man. Thor joins the gang shortly thereafter. However, before the team can take on Loki, the heroes have to solve their personal issues & cut down their giant egos & work together as a team. Problematic? Yes! Iron Man's sarcasm only seems to worsen the situation. The way he makes fun of the others is hilarious! First off, I want to say something. The Avengers is the best movie of the year, so far! Be it the story, the superhero vs. superhero battles, or the sheer epic scale of the film. Loki, is the perfect super villain who is, evil & menacing. The 3D effect in this movie is just eye popping! You will literally duck down every ten seconds. The cinematography is brilliant. The way they've shown Calcutta is authentic. The battle in New York City is outstanding! A note on the performances. Robert Downey Jr. is spectacular as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Iron Man is my most favorite character in the film. Chris Evans is impressive as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Mark Ruffalo is outstanding as Bruce Banner/Hulk. Chris Hemsworth is awesome as Thor. Scarlett Johansson is great as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy Renner is effective as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. Tom Hiddleston is simply wicked as Loki. Even though he's the only villain in the movie he's pulled it off superbly. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill & Stellan Skarsgard as Selvig are superb as well. So, grab your 3D glasses, buy some popcorn, sit back & relax as you watch the most entertaining movie in recent times! Don't miss this on the big screen no matter what people! Now, let's see if The Amazing Spider-Man or The Dark Knight Rises top this one.

2012-05-06,"Man, what a ride! And I am not just talking about this movie itself, but the entire journey it took getting here! Ever since Iron Man in 2008, The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been a blast, with, addition to Iron Man, we also had The Incredible Hulk(2008),Iron Man 2(2010), and last year's two heavy hitters Thor and Captain America:The First Avenger. Now, it all comes to a head in Marvel's The Avengers, in what is, in short, the best comic book film since The Dark Knight!!!!!!!! The plot is mostly centered around Loki(Tom Hiddleston), who is, after being sucked into the black hole at the end of Thor,coming to Earth after finding a way into our realm. S.H.I.E.L.D has been using the tesseract(the weapon Red Skull used in Captain America)for experiments, and Loki uses this as a way to come to Earth. Using a staff that can cross dimensions, given to him by his new army,the Chitauri(an evil alien race),Loki has a master plan to unleash his army upon the world, and when all has settled, Loki will be declared humanity's new king.In response to this act of war, Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D(Samuel L. Jackson), decides to restart the Avenger program. Recruiting Iron Man/Tony Stark(Robert Downey, Jr.), Steve Rogers/Captain America(Chris Evans) and Bruce Banner/The Hulk(Mark Ruffalo), along with Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson), they begin to put a stop to Loki's evil plan. Eventually,Loki's ""brother"" Thor(Chris Hemsworth)shows up, with an intent to take Loki back to Asgard.Loki is not making it easy, however, as he has converted a number of S.H.I.E.L.D members to his side, including Dr. Eric Selvig(Stellan Skarsguard), a scientist who is designing the portal to let Loki's army through, and Clint Barton/Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner),a brilliant marksman and one of Black Widow's closest allies. In order to stop this grave threat, differences must be set aside, difficult choices must be made, and a team will have to come together in stop Loki and the Chitauri army.Avengers Assemble, indeed! For anyone worrying that this wouldn't be the definitive payoff to four years and five films of anticipation can put those fears to rest, because this was..............INCREDIBLE! There are so many things to discuss and give praise for in this movie, so let's start at the beginning.First off, the cast is brilliant,with everybody giving a incredible performance. Tony Stark is my favorite character in all of these films, and RDJ is as great as ever! So dry humored and sarcastic, yet so heroic and likable. Chris Evans builds on an already good performance, making Cap even better this time around. Always thought Hemsworth was terrific as Thor, and he still owned the role here! Can't wait to see him again. Scarlett was very good as Widow, and had great chemistry with the rest of the cast. Jeremy Renner is good as Haweye, but is easily the least fleshed out of the characters. Still, likable and has some good moments. Loki is back, and Hiddleston shines again. If he was heart-wrenching and tragic in Thor, he is scary and menacing here, yet still giving some insight into his pain.The big surprise here is Ruffalo as Banner. I think he was the one that most were skeptical about, as he wasn't carried over for the previous films. However, color me impressed. Ruffalo is fantastic as Banner, having great chemistry with the cast, giving Banner enough a soul so we care for him, and when he is the Hulk(using motion capture and CGI), he has some great, audience cheering moments. All the rest of the cast give great performances,including Skarsguard, Gwnyeth Paltrow as Pepper from Iron Man 1 and 2, and of course Mr. Jackson as Fury.The action scenes were phenomenal. Marvel's own movies aren't exactly known for the action scenes,and as much as I liked the action in those movies,particularly Iron Man 2,Thor, and Incredible Hulk,the action is fantastic,and easily the best action scenes in any superhero movie ever! The script is well-written and full of action. A lot of people have commented that the film looks like the action scenes from the Transformers movies. But I think something must be said here:the action is far better than in those movies. The characters are actually flesh and blood, which grounds it much more in reality, and puts far more at stake. They may have superhuman skills, but they are still human.Can't say that for the Transformers movies.Plus, the characters are played as intelligent, heroic and full of personality, unlike the characters in those films.All in all, this deserves accolade upon accolade. Kudos to Joss Whedon,the cast and crew of this and the other five films,and Marvel for making this a reality! Can't wait to watch them all one day in one long marathon!

2012-07-14,"The Avengers is truly a film that should be considered an instant classic. Joss Whedon does more than do justice to getting four superheroes on the screen, but he makes a tremendous yarn to go with it. Yes, the greatest strength of the film is the screenplay. The one liners are a keeper, and it comes with some great performances as well, particularly with Robert Downey, Jr and Mark Ruffalo. The film entertains in action, succeeds in comedy, and manages to be one of the greatest films we're bound to see this summer, and potentially one of the best films we'll see of the year.

2012-06-14,"It took four years to make The Avengers, by Joss Whedon but it was well worth the wait. The story takes place in New York, in 2012. The Avengers are made up of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye ( Jeremy Renner). The main antagonist of the movie is Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The movie is an Action/ Comedy / Adventure/Sci-fi film. The movie is two hours and twenty three minutes long and by the end you don't want it to be over. In the beginning we find out that Earth has found the Tesseract, an object that can provide an unlimited source of potential energy. It suddenly activates and opens a portal to another world where Loki comes out of. Loki threatens to wage war upon Earth. Now it's up to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to find a way to stop him. He is part of an organization called S.H.I.E.L.D. and he brings together a team of super humans to form The Avengers to save the Earth from Loki and his army. Along the way The Avengers get into arguments, which allows Loki to get away. Loki ends up opening the portal again and his army is able to come to Earth. Will the Avengers be able to stop Loki and his army? You will have to see the movie to find out.I loved the acting in this movie. I think that's what made the movie what it is. I don't think I could choose one favorite, but if I had to it would have to be between The Hulk and Iron Man. The Hulk is my favorite because he is a genius when he is ""normal"" and he smashes everything when he turns into the Hulk. The funniest part of the movie would be when The Hulk punches Thor while fighting Loki army. The only thing I didn't like was that he only became The Hulk two times throughout the entire movie. Iron Man maybe my favorite because he is funny and cool. He is funny and intelligent thought the entire movie. He is funny, for example, when Captain America asks Iron Man, ""If you take off you armor what are you?"" which Iron Man responds with, ""Uh... genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.""Another thing I really liked about this movie is the story. Not for one second did I find the movie boring or unenjoyable. I kept my eyes glued to the screen. The movie has all the things a movie needs. For example the movie has humor, action, and an amazing cast. Also I think all the characters have the right amount lines and everything is distributed evenly, not one actor is more superior to the other.All in all I think the story was amazingly written. After reading this review I bet you understand that I loved this movie. Everything about this movie, in my opinion is perfect. I would recommend everyone to see this movie and not only at home but go to the theater and see it there. You will not enjoy it at home as much as you would in theaters. I would give this a 10/10, or a must see movie.",10.0,2012-06,Thursday,"10:0.06, 2012:0.04, able:0.08, about:0.05, acting:0.03, action:0.03, actor:0.04, after:0.03, again:0.03, all:0.06, along:0.04, also:0.02, amazing:0.03, america:0.04, amount:0.04, an:0.10, and:0.18, another:0.07, are:0.03, army:0.15, as:0.03, at:0.04, avengers:0.08, away:0.04, be:0.07, because:0.05, beginning:0.04, between:0.03, black:0.03, boring:0.04, brings:0.04, but:0.04, by:0.04, can:0.02, captain:0.04, cast:0.03, characters:0.02, chris:0.06, come:0.03, comedy:0.04, comes:0.04, cool:0.04, could:0.03, did:0.03, didn:0.03, don:0.05, downey:0.03, earth:0.13, end:0.03, enjoy:0.03, entire:0.08, evans:0.03, everyone:0.03, everything:0.09, favorite:0.11, fighting:0.04, film:0.02, find:0.15, for:0.04, found:0.04, four:0.04, from:0.02, funny:0.10, fury:0.03, get:0.05, give:0.03, go:0.03, had:0.02, has:0.06, have:0.05, hawkeye:0.03, he:0.22, hemsworth:0.03, hiddleston:0.03, him:0.03, his:0.07, hours:0.04, hulk:0.11, humor:0.03, if:0.04, in:0.09, into:0.05, iron:0.10, is:0.20, it:0.11, jackson:0.03, jeremy:0.03, johansson:0.03, joss:0.03, jr:0.03, like:0.02, liked:0.04, lines:0.04, loki:0.18, long:0.03, loved:0.08, made:0.05, main:0.04, make:0.03, man:0.10, mark:0.03, maybe:0.04, minutes:0.04, more:0.02, movie:0.24, much:0.02, must:0.03, my:0.08, new:0.03, nick:0.03, not:0.07, now:0.03, of:0.08, off:0.03, one:0.05, only:0.07, opinion:0.04, or:0.04, other:0.02, out:0.06, over:0.03, part:0.07, perfect:0.03, place:0.04, really:0.02, recommend:0.04, renner:0.03, review:0.04, right:0.03, robert:0.03, ruffalo:0.03, samuel:0.03, save:0.04, scarlett:0.03, screen:0.03, second:0.04, see:0.08, stop:0.08, story:0.07, super:0.03, take:0.03, takes:0.04, team:0.03, tesseract:0.04, that:0.07, the:0.46, theater:0.04, there:0.02, thing:0.06, things:0.04, think:0.11, this:0.09, thor:0.04, thought:0.03, throughout:0.04, times:0.03, to:0.25, together:0.02, tom:0.03, two:0.06, understand:0.04, up:0.06, wait:0.04, want:0.03, was:0.05, way:0.05, we:0.03, well:0.02, what:0.06, whedon:0.02, when:0.09, where:0.03, which:0.05, while:0.03, widow:0.03, will:0.07, with:0.01, world:0.03, worth:0.04, would:0.12, written:0.04, years:0.03, york:0.04, you:0.14"
2012-05-06,"All I can say is ""WOW!"". After watching patiently every superhero movie since the original Superman in 1978 (most of them many times), I realize now that *this* was the one I have been waiting for. To say it was great would be incredibly unjust - there aren't many words to REALLY convey just how special it is. From the casting to the performances to the writing to the fine details to the effects to the dynamic interplay of the characters, this movie is simply hands down the BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER MADE. I wont give any of it away, and there were too many moments to even begin to describe anyway, but I will for sure be going back to see it at least a couple more times (which I NEVER do)and its one of the very few I will for SURE purchase when it is available. Instant classic, and a defining moment for the superhero movie genre. On the way out of the IMAX 3D theater where I saw it, beyond being simply stunned, I had 2 further immediate thoughts: 1) It was SO mind-numbing, and SO far above any superhero movie I have ever seen, that it reminded me of seeing the 1st Lord of The Rings movie (Fellowship) and how I was similarly stunned and literally dazed upon exiting the cinema... 2) I cant for the life of me figure out WHY the powers that be at DC have not yet come out with a Justice League movie in a similar ensemble fashion - their management is asleep at the wheel if that is NOT in development. Anyway back to the movie itself: Go see it, multiple times.

2012-04-29,"I appreciate this film for what it is. An all out action popcorn movie that aims to wow the audience with its cutting edge effects, fancy camera work and ability to not have to think, and just sit back. The plot was pretty simple and nothing new in terms of old clichéd, alien guy tries to take over the world with his army and big doomsday device scenario with an ending we have seen a million times before with a ""Lets destroy a city with as much explosions and CGI as possible"" chapter. Don't get me wrong, they did a great job with it. Some of the camera work was excellent, much better than Micheal Bay's close up and shake the camera around everywhere technique. But for me personally I don't like being overwhelmed with all the CGI and the camera taking me away from the characters involvement of the scene and scenario and focusing on the effects. The only thing that kept me going till the end was the humor. If it was not for that I would have rated this film as just another bland CGI bonanza.

There is no way this film is even close to a 9 rating (it's at 8.8 or something now) NO WAY.The people who are saying the film is a 9 are most likely hyper teenagers who sit home all day, and don't read anything, and watch reality TV - they don't know what is good and what is terrible.This film is dull. Has no emotion (forced doesn't count), and often times is ridiculous. Though what saves it is the fact it makes fun of itself which is funny. Normally I would rate really low but that humour makes it a little better.It was well done for what it is. But I think what happened is the last few comic book movies (except for batman) were so bad that people were surprised with this one, expecting it to suck. So I read things like this is the greatest film ever, or ""A+"" rating. You have to be joking.One of the things that really gets to me is one part in particular. The HULK Is this un-controllable force. He almost destroys the ship. Makes sense.Then next thing you know he is fighting ALONG with the avengers. UM..HELLO!!?? how the hell did that happen. Oh they magically tamed the beast or something? Banner says ""my secret is I always stay angry"" (something like that) and then turns into the hulk and starts fighting the aliens. This makes no sense.So if he had this mentality all along why did he want to kill everyone on the ship? Nothing was learned. I mean he saves Iron Man later. But on the ship he wanted to kill Thor and others. ????? HUGE GAP. Anyone with half a brain would question this.

2012-05-05,"An article I read summed up The Avengers as ""The Anti-Dark Knight,"" which is NOT a bad thing. It's just about as quality, but rather than being dark and gritty, this movie is fun with hilarious, yet intelligent dialogue. This is the truest comic book film. No, we're not given a bad pun about the villain's costume in the middle of really intense scenes. The movie is intense, intelligent, hilarious, and fun, which is a very odd combo for a movie one would expect to be very Hollywood.This movie spits in the faces of more serious movie-watchers. Even they will get absorbed into this movie for many reasons. Usually, in a Hollywood movie with the success this one was expected to accumulate, you'd see more sex and idiots on screen twisting the plot in the most ridiculous of ways. Well, Scarlett Johansson is not used for seduction on other characters or sexual appeal to viewers. She is here to play Black Widow and be a crucial part of the film! As for idiots, there are none. The characters in this movie are all smart and necessary to the story. All of them do a great job! Even Mark Ruffalo, whose presence will make you forget the great Norton was even the Hulk first.The story is just about as well-balanced as one could hope for between intelligence, action, tension, and flow. The characters' backgrounds are all tied together very well, and the story isn't centered around one character too much more than another. The main characters all get equal screen time and importance to the movie's monumentally huge and intelligent plot. For those who complain we're not given enough depth on characters, we were given a good amount of depth. If we would've gone any more in depth on any one of the characters, the flow of the movie would've succeeded less. We see enough from everyone.To cap this movie off, the action was superb! It's always exciting anytime there is fighting sequences, which are plentiful. The special effects are really well-done, which is expected from a movie with such a budget as this one had to work with. The money was all put to good use. Great action, great actors, great directing, great plot, great dialogue, great movie!!The only complaints one could have is ""They didn't stick with the comic books"" or ""These guys weren't the original Avengers."" This is a film. You cannot directly copy a comic exactly when making a comic book movie. It's a movie. It stands alone. Other complaints are just a few bad lines that are easily pardoned with how much the rest of the script outweighs the few bad lines.This movie spits in the faces of serious movie-watchers. It surely did in mine. I didn't think I'd come across a movie with such an ominous plot in which the manner of the characters isn't totally serious. This is the one great film that was able to do that and still maintain a level of greatness that it does. This is one of the greatest 2000's films. I rank it right up there with The Dark Knight, Return of the King, City of God, Inception, etc. One of the greats of our time.",8.0,2012-05,Saturday,"able:0.04, about:0.07, action:0.05, actors:0.03, all:0.08, always:0.04, amount:0.04, an:0.04, and:0.12, another:0.03, any:0.06, are:0.13, around:0.04, as:0.10, avengers:0.03, bad:0.13, be:0.04, being:0.03, between:0.03, black:0.03, book:0.06, but:0.02, character:0.02, characters:0.14, come:0.03, comic:0.11, could:0.06, dark:0.11, depth:0.13, dialogue:0.08, did:0.03, didn:0.06, do:0.05, does:0.03, done:0.03, effects:0.03, enough:0.07, even:0.07, everyone:0.03, exciting:0.04, expect:0.04, expected:0.08, few:0.07, fighting:0.04, film:0.08, films:0.03, first:0.02, for:0.09, from:0.04, fun:0.06, get:0.05, given:0.12, god:0.04, good:0.04, great:0.19, greatest:0.05, guys:0.04, had:0.02, have:0.02, here:0.03, hollywood:0.09, hope:0.04, how:0.03, huge:0.04, hulk:0.02, if:0.02, in:0.12, into:0.03, is:0.18, isn:0.08, it:0.09, job:0.03, johansson:0.03, just:0.06, knight:0.08, less:0.04, lines:0.08, main:0.04, make:0.03, making:0.04, many:0.03, mark:0.03, money:0.04, more:0.09, most:0.03, movie:0.25, much:0.05, no:0.03, norton:0.04, not:0.07, of:0.21, off:0.03, on:0.07, one:0.17, only:0.03, or:0.04, original:0.05, other:0.05, our:0.04, part:0.03, play:0.04, plot:0.11, put:0.04, rather:0.04, re:0.07, read:0.04, really:0.05, rest:0.04, right:0.03, ruffalo:0.03, scarlett:0.03, scenes:0.03, screen:0.06, script:0.04, see:0.04, sequences:0.04, serious:0.14, she:0.04, special:0.03, still:0.03, story:0.07, such:0.07, than:0.05, that:0.06, the:0.46, them:0.02, there:0.06, these:0.03, they:0.04, thing:0.03, think:0.03, this:0.16, those:0.03, time:0.04, to:0.12, together:0.02, too:0.03, up:0.04, used:0.04, ve:0.06, very:0.07, villain:0.03, was:0.08, we:0.14, well:0.09, were:0.02, when:0.02, which:0.13, who:0.02, widow:0.03, will:0.05, with:0.13, work:0.03, would:0.07, yet:0.04, you:0.05"

2012-04-26,"Over the past five years we have been exposed to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has introduced us to a multitude of characters. Finally, it all comes to a head in this massive ensemble. Following the arrival of the Norse God Loki (Tom Hiddleston), S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles a team of six of the most powerful individuals the world has ever seen to combat the threat. However, their egos and suspicions of one another create a lot of friction in the group. Many feared that the screen time of this film would be dominated by a single character, with the rest simply playing supporting roles. They needn't have worried, as each Avenger is given an appropriate amount of attention. Returning to their roles from the previous Marvel films are Robert Downey Jr. as the pretentious yet well-meaning industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Evans as the recently resurrected World War II hero Steve Rogers/Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Norse God Thor (Loki's stepbrother) and Scarlett Johansson as enigmatic spy Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy Renner expands upon his brief cameo in ""Thor"" as Clint Barton/Hawkeye, by far the most interesting member of the group. Replacing Edward Norton as Bruce Banner/The Hulk is Mark Ruffalo, who fills the role surprisingly well. Badass as usual is Jackson as Fury. We also see quite a lot of fan favorite Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg), who makes his most memorable appearance so far. Returning in supporting roles are Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Dr. Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard). Introduced in this film is Agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), who doesn't really get enough screen time to make a proper impression. While the entire cast is solid, the best performance by far is by Hiddleston. As the film's primary villain, he cuts an imposing figure, peering a death glare at the audience and relishing every word as he attempts to get inside the heroes' heads. Director Joss Whedon, the man behind ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" and ""Firefly"", once again shows his ability to create a well-made ensemble piece. Following in the footsteps of Jon Favreau, Kenneth Branagh, Louis Letterier and Joe Johnston, he was the ideal choice for this film. Whedon was able to cover all of the necessary areas, from the emotional impact of the death of a major character, to the film's many moments of humor and the many heart-racing action scenes. Another triumph is the film's special effects. The motion capture used to create the Hulk has made him look more realistic than any previous live-action portrayal, Loki's army of Chitauri aliens are a convincing force to be reckoned with and vehicles are created that could never exist in reality. Furthermore, Whedon alumni Alexis Denisof is unrecognizable as The Other, a mysterious villain who hints at what is going on behind the scenes (and what will come to the front in future installments). While it won't win any Oscars, The Avengers succeeds in all of the intended areas. A character-driven story with heart, action and humor, it brings these iconic characters to the big screen in a way that does them justice, and will thrill audiences from beginning to end.",8.0,2012-04,Thursday,"able:0.05, action:0.06, again:0.04, agent:0.11, all:0.05, also:0.03, america:0.03, amount:0.05, an:0.05, and:0.15, another:0.08, any:0.07, are:0.08, army:0.05, as:0.24, at:0.05, audience:0.05, avenger:0.05, avengers:0.02, banner:0.04, be:0.04, been:0.03, beginning:0.05, best:0.03, big:0.03, black:0.03, brings:0.05, bruce:0.04, by:0.10, captain:0.03, cast:0.04, character:0.08, characters:0.05, chris:0.08, cinematic:0.05, come:0.04, comes:0.04, could:0.03, director:0.08, does:0.03, doesn:0.04, downey:0.03, each:0.03, effects:0.03, end:0.04, enough:0.04, ensemble:0.10, entire:0.05, evans:0.04, ever:0.03, every:0.03, fan:0.04, far:0.12, favorite:0.05, film:0.14, films:0.03, finally:0.04, for:0.02, from:0.07, fury:0.07, get:0.06, given:0.05, god:0.09, going:0.04, group:0.10, has:0.07, have:0.04, hawkeye:0.03, he:0.08, hemsworth:0.04, hero:0.04, heroes:0.03, hiddleston:0.08, him:0.04, his:0.08, however:0.04, hulk:0.05, humor:0.08, in:0.16, interesting:0.05, iron:0.02, is:0.14, it:0.04, jackson:0.08, jeremy:0.04, johansson:0.04, joss:0.03, jr:0.03, loki:0.08, look:0.04, lot:0.07, made:0.06, make:0.03, makes:0.04, man:0.05, many:0.10, mark:0.03, marvel:0.05, moments:0.04, more:0.03, most:0.09, never:0.04, nick:0.04, norton:0.05, of:0.24, on:0.02, once:0.04, one:0.02, other:0.03, over:0.03, past:0.05, performance:0.05, previous:0.09, quite:0.04, really:0.03, renner:0.04, rest:0.05, robert:0.03, role:0.05, ruffalo:0.03, samuel:0.04, scarlett:0.04, scenes:0.06, screen:0.10, see:0.03, seen:0.03, simply:0.05, single:0.05, so:0.02, special:0.04, stark:0.04, story:0.03, team:0.03, than:0.03, that:0.05, the:0.54, their:0.05, them:0.03, these:0.03, they:0.02, this:0.06, thor:0.05, time:0.05, to:0.22, tom:0.04, tony:0.04, universe:0.05, us:0.04, used:0.05, villain:0.08, was:0.04, way:0.03, we:0.06, well:0.08, what:0.05, whedon:0.09, which:0.03, while:0.08, who:0.11, widow:0.03, will:0.05, with:0.05, won:0.05, world:0.07, would:0.03, years:0.04, yet:0.04"
2012-05-25,"An example of inspiring cinema directed for young and old alike, ""The Avengers"" is does it all in this recent block buster.

Robert Downey, Jr. is Iron Man once again, and he gives another uniformly perfect performance. Chris Evans is Captain America, and he too is outstanding as this superman-like individual fighting for truth and justice and the ""American Way"". Mark Ruffalo plays Dr. Bruce Banner/ The Hulk and he too is well cast and successful with his part. Thor is portrayed by Chris Hemsworth, and he too is exemplary with his performance. Of course, there is Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, the leader of this brave crew. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff, is very convincing and an extremely tough ingénue in a film which is not directed by Woody Allen. Joss Whedon has written and directed this smash hit in 3D, and I advise that it be seen with this medium, since the special effects are enhanced to the point of overwhelming reality.

2012-05-04,"I went to see The Avengers in a movie theater in Paris. It actually seemed kind of strange that it premiered there a week before it did in the United States. Nevertheless, I wanted to watch it in order to prove to myself that some Marvel Universe productions based on comic books can be outstanding. Unfortunately, as I left my seat I thought that, like all the previous one-superhero- shows, it disappointed me entirely.Why, should you ask?Basically, the plot is childish, but I wouldn't expect more from a big budget blockbuster made only to pleasure the masses. As of now, it can somehow achieve the greatest opening ever. Wow. It already made a fortune from the great marketing campaign that started weeks before the opening day. That's truly brilliant, considering WHAT is being advertised throughout the world as one of the best movies in years.I must admit, it is strangely awesome that they were able to assemble such a cast of stars and pack them into one two-hour film. The names speak for themselves. But what can be achieved with so many highly-paid actors when the whole idea behind the picture seems dull? I love to see all of the well-known faces shown on the screen together at one particular moment, but when the scene isn't entertaining the point is really becoming unimportant.The dialogues are cheap. They do not show any insight into the characters' positions in the circle of The Avengers. Of course, in order to fully understand who is who and the relations between the heroes it is mandatory to watch all of the movies that show the origins of every single person. Now I want to point point some out a few aspects that make the movie a little more enjoyable. There were a few nicely implied gags that made me laugh. Most of them were connected with Hulk's turbulent nature. And that is always a good thing to make fun of. Also the many sarcastic, but highly intelligent remarks made by Tony Stark made me believe that Iron Man must certainly be the most amazing guy in the entourage. Additionally I would like to note that you don't have to watch the movie in 3D in order to get the best experience (the enormous potential of this technology isn't actually given). All of the epic major explosions, blasts, rampages and spectacular fights are providing great special effects in themselves. This is the part that is probably the most pleasurable - when the Avengers team do not speak to each other, but just fight their way through evil forces in order to stop Loki, Thor's brother. Action sequences are decent and the camera motions that shifts between all of the battling heroes deserve a recognition.All in all, I have to say that I would much rather read the comic book while riding a subway to work than waste my time seating in the cramped cinema on a Thursday evening. Now I just have to hope that all the other 2012 epic superhero productions will be better. Because even after this 'slight' disappointment I still believe that this year will provide the greatest entertainment in this genre that the world has ever seen.",6.0,2012-05,Friday,"2012:0.04, 3d:0.04, able:0.05, action:0.02, actors:0.04, actually:0.08, after:0.03, all:0.14, already:0.04, also:0.03, always:0.04, amazing:0.03, and:0.06, any:0.03, are:0.06, as:0.06, assemble:0.04, at:0.02, avengers:0.06, awesome:0.04, be:0.08, because:0.03, before:0.07, being:0.03, believe:0.09, best:0.05, better:0.03, between:0.07, big:0.03, blockbuster:0.04, book:0.03, brilliant:0.05, brother:0.04, but:0.08, by:0.02, can:0.07, cast:0.03, certainly:0.05, characters:0.02, cinema:0.04, comic:0.06, course:0.04, day:0.05, did:0.03, disappointed:0.05, do:0.06, don:0.03, each:0.03, effects:0.03, entertaining:0.04, entertainment:0.05, epic:0.09, even:0.03, ever:0.06, every:0.03, evil:0.04, expect:0.04, experience:0.04, few:0.07, fight:0.04, film:0.02, for:0.02, from:0.04, fun:0.03, genre:0.05, get:0.03, given:0.04, good:0.02, great:0.05, greatest:0.10, guy:0.04, has:0.02, have:0.06, heroes:0.06, highly:0.09, hope:0.05, hour:0.05, hulk:0.02, idea:0.05, in:0.22, into:0.06, iron:0.02, is:0.13, isn:0.08, it:0.12, just:0.04, kind:0.04, left:0.05, like:0.04, little:0.04, loki:0.03, love:0.04, made:0.14, make:0.06, man:0.02, many:0.06, marvel:0.02, me:0.08, moment:0.04, more:0.05, most:0.08, movie:0.05, movies:0.05, much:0.03, must:0.07, my:0.05, not:0.04, now:0.10, of:0.19, on:0.06, one:0.08, only:0.03, other:0.05, out:0.02, part:0.04, plot:0.03, point:0.13, previous:0.04, probably:0.04, rather:0.05, read:0.05, really:0.02, say:0.03, scene:0.04, screen:0.03, see:0.05, seemed:0.05, seems:0.04, seen:0.03, sequences:0.04, should:0.03, show:0.08, single:0.05, so:0.02, some:0.05, special:0.03, spectacular:0.05, stark:0.04, stars:0.05, still:0.03, stop:0.04, such:0.04, superhero:0.05, team:0.03, than:0.03, that:0.28, the:0.54, theater:0.05, their:0.02, them:0.05, there:0.05, they:0.04, thing:0.04, this:0.07, thor:0.02, thought:0.04, through:0.04, throughout:0.05, time:0.02, to:0.25, together:0.03, tony:0.04, truly:0.05, two:0.04, understand:0.05, universe:0.04, want:0.04, watch:0.08, way:0.03, well:0.02, went:0.05, were:0.08, what:0.05, when:0.08, while:0.04, who:0.05, whole:0.04, why:0.04, will:0.05, with:0.03, work:0.04, world:0.07, would:0.05, year:0.04, years:0.04, you:0.04"

2013-01-27,"Honestly, I like the odd superhero movie but the makers of this are like the fat kid in Willy The Wonka who has to have all the chocolate. This production (sic) treats the entire audience as low IQ zombies (no offence to actual zombies intended). There is zero depth of character development and zero story line interest. At no time whatsoever do you ever feel a sense of suspense or danger. At no time do you care if any of the characters come to harm - well you kind of know that none of them will as their superheroes - obviously. And why even bother having humans with no super powers - Oh I forgot, the humans in it are the most magical, unbelievable fighting machines. They just stand there wasting anything in their path, and Im not talking about the super heroes here. Rambo is but a beginner compared to them.Every single facet of this farce is totally predictable from start to finish. Its one of those where you pray your transported to another reality and the bad guys actually win.Technically its all good except the sound department have again gone mental. The action scenes are incredibly loud and were at times quite painful on the ears (seriously) and then the speaking parts were often so whispered and muffled sounding. I'm sure during post the sound guys sit there with the best sound system money can buy - but the reality is their mix doesn't translate well across systems. Bad sound isn't the problem, its the post mixing. I hear this issue on far to many movies these days and its ruining many films.The acting by some of the cast is decent, considering the ridiculously poor script they have to work with. But in no way will any of them be remembering their part in this movie during their twilight years. This is a money and profile job - nothing more. Even then I do have to wonder if putting your name to this is actually worth it?. The directing is amateur hour. His/her (I don't know and don't care) focus is squarely on action and FX - so why not just have the FX team direct it as they certainly would have done a better job than the lucky ducky who managed to land this lucrative job. I do wonder if the director has actually ever watched a movie to see how one directs actors?Anyway, I cant say much more about this nonsense except if you enjoy a movie which is one long mind numbing boring action scene, aimed at a dumbed down populace - then this is for you.PS I cannot believe this movie gained so much favourable reviews.

2012-04-27,"I went into this movie with very high expectations cause I watched all the trailers about 30 times each. I will say from the very first 10 minutes of the films I was instantly blown away by the action and the course of the story. All the characters in this film get an equal amount of screen time, which is usually the problem in a film where you deal with multiple characters such as in this film. I applaud Joss Whedon for making this Marvel Masterpiece, the way everything fits together in this film is truly amazing and its close to impossible to find any holes in the story. Mr Whedon was the perfect person to have dealt with telling this story as he's a comic book fan, he nailed it 100%. I believe i'm going to see this film again tomorrow, it is just that awesome.

2012-04-27,"Avengers (all right, ""Avengers Assemble"" if you insist) is really quite extraordinarily good. It's pretty much everything that's fun about superhero comics translated directly onto the screen - I was hoping for as much from Joss Whedon and he delivered.Like Serenity and the Buffy season 5 finale, it's extremely well-structured so that everyone gets more than one moment to shine in both dialogue and action scenes; I can't think of another action movie that has so many characters and is so well-balanced between them all, and all the different combinations of arguments and team-ups between them.It's also extremely funny (but *mostly* not in that trademark Joss Whedon ""Buffyspeak"" way that some VERY WRONG people find ""precious"" and annoying). It has better Tony Stark dialogue than either Iron Man movie! Having said that, the funniest gags are visual ones that involve the Hulk...I often complain that superhero films' weakest parts tend to be their climactic action sequences: the stakes are raised, and believability is strained. Well, for once we have a superhero film whose best action scene comes at the end. It's one of the best-sustained action finales since The Matrix - and much better-directed than the incomprehensible shots of The Dark Knight. It's constantly spectacular and contains countless satisfying moments in both action and dialogue - most of which also happen to be very funny.But the best *single scene* in the whole film isn't an action scene! A standard phrase Joss Whedon has used in promotional interviews is ""I wanted to figure out why all these different characters should even be in the same room as each other"". Well, that scene where they *are* all in the same room as each other turned out to be the film's absolute highlight. Scenes like that are what I'll look forward to on subsequent viewings. There have been lots of action films that I've enjoyed at the cinema for their sheer spectacle but then have felt little desire to re-watch because that they didn't have much else going for them (Avatar comes to mind) - but this isn't one of them.The film's plot isn't exactly intricate: it's extremely tightly focused around the MacGuffin from Thor and Captain America. However, this isn't a bad thing: in a film of this scale, ensuring the characterisation and action is satisfying is an ambitious balancing act as it is, without adding a complex twisty-turny plot to the mix as well.The film doesn't carry any sort of larger real-world message; it's really just a movie about these specific characters - about guys in silly costumes beating the living daylights out of each other. But as far as movies about guys in silly costumes beating the living daylights out of each other go... well, it's hard to imagine how they could get much better.",10.0,2012-04,Friday,"about:0.12, action:0.20, all:0.10, also:0.06, america:0.03, an:0.05, and:0.19, another:0.04, any:0.03, are:0.09, around:0.05, as:0.15, assemble:0.05, at:0.05, avengers:0.04, bad:0.04, be:0.09, because:0.03, been:0.03, best:0.09, better:0.11, between:0.08, both:0.10, but:0.09, can:0.03, captain:0.03, characters:0.08, cinema:0.05, comes:0.09, comics:0.04, could:0.03, dark:0.04, dialogue:0.15, didn:0.04, different:0.09, doesn:0.04, each:0.13, else:0.05, end:0.04, enjoyed:0.05, even:0.03, everyone:0.04, everything:0.04, far:0.04, felt:0.05, film:0.14, films:0.07, find:0.05, for:0.08, from:0.05, fun:0.04, funny:0.08, get:0.03, gets:0.05, go:0.04, going:0.04, good:0.03, guys:0.10, hard:0.05, has:0.08, have:0.09, having:0.05, he:0.03, how:0.03, however:0.04, hulk:0.02, if:0.03, in:0.17, iron:0.03, is:0.11, isn:0.19, it:0.16, joss:0.10, just:0.03, knight:0.05, like:0.05, little:0.04, ll:0.05, look:0.05, man:0.03, many:0.04, mind:0.05, moment:0.05, moments:0.04, more:0.03, most:0.03, movie:0.05, movies:0.03, much:0.15, not:0.02, of:0.17, on:0.02, once:0.05, one:0.06, other:0.12, out:0.11, parts:0.06, people:0.04, plot:0.07, pretty:0.04, quite:0.05, re:0.05, real:0.05, really:0.06, right:0.04, said:0.05, same:0.08, scene:0.16, scenes:0.07, screen:0.04, sequences:0.05, should:0.04, since:0.04, single:0.05, so:0.07, some:0.03, spectacular:0.06, stark:0.04, superhero:0.09, team:0.04, than:0.09, that:0.22, the:0.35, their:0.06, them:0.12, then:0.04, there:0.03, these:0.07, they:0.07, thing:0.04, think:0.03, this:0.05, thor:0.03, to:0.15, tony:0.04, used:0.05, ve:0.04, very:0.06, visual:0.05, was:0.02, watch:0.03, way:0.03, we:0.03, well:0.16, what:0.03, whedon:0.10, where:0.04, which:0.03, whole:0.04, why:0.04, without:0.04, world:0.04, wrong:0.05, you:0.02"
2012-05-02,"Initially when I first saw the trailer I was a bit reluctant about this flick – I thought it would be another good, but average superhero movie. After watching it, however, I just had to admit: this was one of the best action movies I've seen in years.The story is a simple as that: Locki returns with his obsession of being a 'beloved' king and along with his army decides to dominate Earth. Then, Nick Fury makes a union with Iron Man, Hulk, Thor and Captain America (The Avengers) to save our planet.Reading this synopsis may make you think this is a silly movie, but it is because of this simplicity that 'The Avengers' is so good. The story just gets direct to the point without hesitation and involves the audience since the beginning. There is also some laughing moment between the action scenes – which I felt was great. Just to break the ice – Iron Man with his sardonic jokes.Another aspect I felt while watching it was how it was made to be unpretentious, but fun and entertaining. I have noticed that some recent Hollywood movies have been failing on these points – I mean, sometimes they try to make action films so 'complex' and serious – but why complicate it? We are just looking forward a nice film to relax and enjoy the time and 'The Avengers' provides it easily – at least for me it did.Then, mix all these aspects with a lot of explosions – yes, they destroyed Manhattan again! – astounding visual effects and a great cast (this time we have the best Hulk ever with Mark Ruffalo).

2012-04-27,"Avengers is a great movie with awesome action, and a story that is simple enough to follow. It doesn't matter if you have seen earlier MARVEL movies or not, although if you have seen them it will provide great character depth. Each character gets its own moments - both physically and emotionally, but quick witted on liners by Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.) and awesome action pieces by Hulk steals the show. Loki(Tom Hiddleston) has his moments to as major super villain. The movie has humor, and all in the right places. The screenplay, dialogues and dialogue delivery is very good and action pieces are the kind that you have never scene before, especially in last half hour.This movie is EPIC.In short, it a movie that you should not miss and if you do you will regret it later.

This movie is quite a lot of fun, especially if you like action. It's a roller coaster from beginning till the end and the story is not too shabby, either.

2012-05-27,"As someone who has not read Marvel comics, has not seen the films ""Captain America,"" ""The Hulk,"" ""Thor,"" or ""Iron Man II,"" this film failed to pull me in. As a standalone movie, ""The Avengers"" feels like a mishmash of rapid surface-level character introduction and way too much action. Little attention is given to character development, as it seems viewers are expected to come into the film with a degree of knowledge. However, this is not to say that I think the film would be great if I did have some knowledge of the backstory. There's little in the way of a moral here or a deeper meaning, as this is just a good-GUY-saves-world plot. It's one that (like many superhero movies before) makes me ask if character development or THOUGHT, for that matter, really are being extinguished by money-driven action. I wouldn't even call this a ""popcorn movie,"" as I found few laughs and absolutely no connection to the characters in my experience. I like action movies, but I need to be drawn in to the characters in order to CARE about the action. ""The Avengers"" didn't even try to draw me in, it just said ""here are the heroes, now watch them fight!"" If the first hour had established some human element for the heroes, I might have liked the action. As it stands, the audience is thrown into the arena with the invincible combatants, and expected to immediately feel for them despite their inherent invincibility. I must ask - why should I care about action when one side can't lose and I haven't been told otherwise? Why should I root for the Yankees? (The only reason I can see is because the ""bad guy"" Loki wears a ridiculous looking costume). I keep attempting to find redemption in society's reception of this movie. Maybe that's why I hope that I'm just missing a big part of the backstory. I'm a big Whedon fan, and came into ""The Avengers"" hoping to see some more of his magic. I was rewarded with a two-and-a-half hour snooze fest of CG action.

2012-04-30,"The fans of the franchise now, have another reason to smile, this time an even bigger one!! :-)Ever since the trailer of The Avengers went on air, from that very day I had been watching it daily twice at least. Already knowing that its got to be a fantastic film...somewhere I feared that hype often kills it!!Thank God!! Nothing like that happened...instead, I, after finally having watched the awesome Superhero flick, feel that this one was under hyped!!!Its a waayyyyyy tooo goooooddd!!!!! One of the best kick-ass action flicks EVER!F***!!! I don't have words enough to describe the excitement I'm in right now. Brilliant it is! Anyone who has ever read any Superhero comic book in his life, GO SEE the movie...Having dazzling set designs all amazingly well crafted into one package, director Joss Whedon to my amazement has given this Superhero feast, a nice new treatment. And that is that The Avengers despite having been put into Genres like Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi, surprise, surprise, it is Extremely funny too...I knew Tony Stark(aka Iron Man) would be delivering some witty lines here and there, but never was I expecting it to be sooo hilarious!! Amazing work!!6 Superheroes, the earth to save, It has EVERYTHING a fan-boy would ever ask for, even more!!After having successfully introduced us to Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America in their individual ventures, Marvel studios have done a brilliantly good job by developing this unbelievable spectacle!!One more thing that I would specially appreciate about The Avengers is that EVERY superhero gets his/her deserving screen space! Nobody was overshadowing.Iron Man is techy, Hulk is destructive, Thor being a Demi-god it must have been a really difficult task to group them up along with Black Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America who are already used to obeying orders. Plus with all that being in place initially they had their egos clashing against one another. Having all that resolved, the enemy is Loki, brother of Thor, there were Supernatural creatures that had to be blended within the perimeters of the world that had been developed. Man, this would have been one hell of a tough job!!Spectacular, jaw dropping action, excellent fun, smart and witty dialogues make this Superhero extravaganza a treat to watch!! Exceeds all expectations.I'm still working on believing it! It was that good... And well, I don't know if I should tell this in public but I, literally was sitting on the seat like a little child, clapping, whistling and laughing my lungs out, enjoying every scene of the movie.There is sooo much to write about but that would be unnecessary i guess, so only one suggestion in the end.....Don't miss this!!This definitely couldn't be any better. Hats off to Joss Whedon, the cast who delivered their performances with a panache and to the Marvel crew!!!This was by far the most entertaining memorable movie I have seen in my life!! Will cherish this for long..... I wish I had my friends with me...huh!! Nevermind..!! ;-)The Avengers.....Go!! Go!!

2012-04-25,"I just got back from the movie theater where I saw The Avengers. Without spoiling anything, I must say it is indeed a spectacular spectacular and I hope to find time to watch it again in the near future. It's an action bonanza laced with fine performances (I love the arguments between Captain America and Iron Man cleverly delivered by Chris Evans and Robert Downey, Jr.), clever humor and not surprisingly Marvel universe references. Anyone who is a comic reader or a Marvel universe fan will notice lots of fine details on the characters, the plot and the images. Even with the daunting challenge of presenting The Avengers as an entertaining all-star gathering, director Joss Whedon cleverly told the story while utilizing the fine talents of the stars.

2012-06-10,"It's finally here. OH MY GOD. As a big comic fan it's amazing to see how far the genre has come in the last decade. We finally get star studded spin-off featuring a large cast of some of the greatest characters. If you've been living under a rock, then you may not have noticed that over the last five years, Marvel have been churning out their big hitters and building up to The Avengers. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and Hulk join forces to stop Thor's brother, Loki and his alien army. Sure, the plot is simple, but that's what we want for a big smackdown. For any team we need a great leader and Marvel have found the best in Joss Whedon. With his familiarity with large ensembles he effortlessly gives every hero their due. He also manages to flesh out characters in very short scenes. We get a sense of Stark and Potts relationship, some back story for Black Widow and Hawkeye, the confusion of Rogers and so forth. He does his best work with Hulk. I've loved every incarnation of the Hulk so far, so I was wary of Ruffalo's performance. He captures it perfectly, going for a more nervous and geeky Banner. When the Hulk is unleashed, Whedon makes sure to not take it too seriously. Hulk gets the biggest laughs in this surprisingly comic film. The action is fantastic, with a number of exciting set pieces. The final battle has so many wonderful character moments immersed in the action, and they really do work as a team. There are a couple of shortcomings. The alien race is just pathetic, and never really feels like a threat. Add to that the whole mother ship destroyed and every alien dies plot convenience. The film lacks any real threat. We hear about the many people Loki kills, but we never see anything that relates to this. Without seeing the sacrifices made it's hard to get too involved. There are also a few moments where characters just happen to show up. These are things that are minor nitpicks. After all, the only way to do a perfect Avengers movie would be to have an unlimited budget and unlimited running time.

2012-04-29,"I wouldn't recommend it to a friend but I wouldn't try to persuade them not to see it either. I usually find IMDb ratings fairly accurate. The Current rating of 8.9 suggests this movie will be something special. Unfortunately all I saw was something very typical, very Hollywood and very predictable. As more people vote and the hype dies down this movies rating will fall below 8.Don't get me wrong, you will be entertained if you watch it.. The special effects are ... well.. Special. There are even several instances where you will laugh out loud. There are some genuinely funny parts that I wasn't expecting.The problem is the story line is very unoriginal and you're never gripped by what is unfolding. Think transformers. There are just too many clichés, and many instances where things are simply not plausible, even for superheroes. I know it's not meant to be realistic but you will be muttering under your breath ""yeah bull ___ "" at some of the outrageously unlikely feats. Ironman's mid-air ship repair is one particularly bad scene you should watch out for.The acting was acceptable given the script they were working with. It's hard to deliver a line well when it's a god awful cliché. It's the kind of thing where the actor just about looks at the camera and says ""Let's get these guys!"" or ""you're going to pay for that!"" It sounds like an overly negative review but that has a lot to do with my expectations given the IMDb rating.

2012-07-16,"These Marvel comics obviously have a lot of fans, and apparently whatever it was that fans (and many non-fans) were looking for in a Marvel film was fulfilled here, explaining the huge internet buzz, the vast amounts of money this has made, and it's current spot in the top 50 films of all time on the Internet Movie Database. This movie does have expensive looking action, and some comedic bits with lots of superheroes, but what it's missing is...pretty much everything else. The plot is uninteresting and quite honestly stupid, and nothing really is driving this story along. At times, to me, it grew boring, because there was nothing to get excited about besides action, big stars and comedy.After Norse god Loki steals the powerful potential super weapon ""Tesseract"" from the peace keeping S.H.I.E.L.D. agency, and mind controls a few people, Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) puts together a team of superheroes known as the Avengers, made up of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and eventually Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Loki is in cahoots with a group of aliens called the Chitauri, and plans to help them take over Earth. The Avengers must stop fighting with each other in order to protect the Earth...can they do it, or will the Earth be destroyed? (Take a guess).Director Joss Wheddon, known for his work on television series, does a fine job with the direction when it comes to action. The big action scenes are appropriately frenetic, and they look big and shiny. I appreciated that the action scenes were spaced apart from each other also, as to not overkill the action like the Transformers films. The fighting scenes between the Avengers was a bit overkill however. Half the movie is them disagreeing with each other, or Tony Stark being snarky with everyone. These scenes don't really have anything to them either. They aren't exciting. They are meant to be funny, but oftentimes comes off as more infantile in the humor department than anything else. They further the plot along, only in that the plot cannot proceed until these guys stop fighting. These scenes are supposed to work as character development, but it's almost unbelievable how stupid these guys are, and how unwilling they are to put their differences aside.The middle of the movie takes place on a ship, with the Avengers angry at each other, and this whole section of the movie just meanders. You could say that this part of the movie gives us the character conflicts and whatnot, which it does, but the Avengers' dislike of each other could have been introduced in something more important to the plot, instead of practically stopping the plot to have these guys get angry at each other. And that's really the movie's biggest problem is the plot. There's never really a feeling of dread, or that something bad could happen, and it's hard to care about anything that's happening. That's not to say watching Tony Stark bantering isn't amusing, or watching Bruce Banner go insane as the Hulk isn't interesting, but nothing ever truly feels at stake. When the film decides to kill off a character to add some level of emotion, and serve as a reason for these heroes to stop their childishness, it doesn't work on an emotional level. It comes off as a cheap way to further along the plot. The Avengers has some good elements to it. It's got a lot of charisma in the cast, and each character is given enough screen time I suppose. The action scenes are satisfying mostly, and some of the comedy isn't bad (while some does come off as a bit corny and pandering to the audience). The problem is the plot, where the villains never really come off as menacing, despite possessing a super weapon, and a main villain is Loki who is about as threatening as a teddy bear. There's nothing to the film, and nothing to really love about it, unless you are a big fan of these actors, the comics, or explosions. There's very little below the surface of the film, and without a good plot to move this along, we've essentially got one long Avengers origin story. Apparently many have fallen in love with this though, so if you like your movies big, dumb and full of buff dudes, you'll probably like this one quite a bit.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 140 mins.

Back in 2012 this was a big thing: after their individual films Iron Man, Hulk, Thor and Captain America (together with two top assassins) team up to battle Loki and an entire army of aliens. Now we know this was just the beginning of the MCU. It is still one of the stronger films of the franchise out there. The chemistry between those characters/actors works magic. And it is the fun in seeing them both verbally and physically fighting with each other that is the Ace of the MCU and it pretty much started here. It still misses the gravitas some of the later films have (the Coulson drama doesn't really hit off that well). The action is solid and still fresh (back in '12 it was still unique when an entire city was destroyed through superhero fighting). Oh it also features the best turn of Hiddlestone as Loki.

2012-08-12,"I've always watched Marvel films but I've never been the greatest fan of them. I find them entertaining but they are often similar and rarely deliver quite such the memorable and action-packed experience that 'Avengers Assemble' offers. Seriously, whether you are a Marvel fan or not, give this film a chance, it may very well surprise you.I can't think of any particularly large faults to this movie that are worth mentioning, the plot isn't exactly unique but that's not what I saw as the purpose of the film. The film's plot tied together the previous Marvel films featuring heroes such as Iron Man and Captain America very well, it then went on to set up and deliver a roller coaster ride of sci-fi action unlike anything I've ever seen before in a Marvel film.'Avengers Assemble' certainly beats the previous films in terms of CGI, action, characters and memorability. From the opinions of friends, I know that the film has even appealed to those that aren't directly a fan of sci-fi action. There is certainly something about the film that simply stuns the viewer and impresses them with up-to-date visuals and a fast-paced storyline. A fact worth mentioning is that, unlike previous films, 'Avengers Assemble' doesn't take itself too seriously. It's not a comedy, or a parody, but it does allow for humorous moments that actually made me smile more than some actual comedies have. This allows you to enjoy the film further I feel, rather than taking away the more serious elements.If you haven't seen the film already, make sure to find the time to watch it, it will entertain you in some way or another and is definitely worth at least one viewing.

2012-05-07,"It took Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America to build up to this, and was it worth the wait, Yes in deed.Nick Fury(Samual L. Jackson) brings together Captain America(Chris Evans), Iron Man(Robert Doney Jr), Thor(Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk(Mark Rufalo), Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner) in hopes of stopping Loki(Tom Hiddleston) from world domination.It was worth it all the way through. Samual L. Jackson this time is front and center, and really shines in the role of Nick Fury. So does everybody else, Mark Rufalo really brings his own to Bruce Banner, although I do miss Edward Norton in the role, Rufalo does quite well. And Tom Hiddleston is quite menacing as Loki, more so then he was in Thor(2011), he was the best villain, almost tops The Joker. The rest of the cast are pretty good also.

2012-09-27,"Living in a world of more than 7 billion people, one must consider this as a critical fact, without trying to counter-argue for any reason whatsoever: the diversity in opinions can be unimaginably huge.And what is the reason for this? What are the main variables that are to be held responsible for someone's opinions? Well, there is the environment we grow up & live in, for two big ones, with all their subcategories, like the people that surround us and their beliefs of any kind. If you grow up, for example, in a family that values honesty, they'll probably push you into becoming an honest being. If you grow up in a family that enjoys watching comedies in their free time, you'll probably grow a ""thing"" for comedies later on in your life - no matter how attracted you may become to other genres of movies, a comedy will always be something you enjoy for various reasons, the remembrance of your happy family moments for one.Let's say you're a fan of Sci-Fi movies. You most likely grew up watching such and you've definitely been taken your breath away by certain ""classics"", as we call them nowadays, that left you with some kind of a mental mark about how awesome they were. Alien, for instance. A totally breath-taking Horror film, a masterpiece for it's kind, it's era. So, to my point: It is wrong to compare any new film to the one that let you breathless. I mean, feel free to judge that what you just watched is better or worse, but you can't direct a whole review to why a movie ""rocked your world"" or ""totaly sucked"" based on your mental mark about your favorite movie and it's perfect, to you, characteristics, specifications & moments. Of course, there are reasons and places to do so, if for example there is an award to be given between two or more, but nothing more or less.I did enjoy The Avengers. I did enjoy the cast. I believe that Robert Downey Jr. acts in a very stylish, awesome for me way, that I might have enjoyed the movie only because I like him as Iron Man. Mark Ruffalo and Christ Hemsworth are very amusing to watch as well, their impersonations of The Hulk and Thor being incredibly amazing. Overally the cast fit their roles well-enough to create an enjoyable, rocking atmosphere that will hold you tight in place until the very end.There were plenty of moments where I was slightly disappointed, like the extreme damage and conditions that Iron Man's suit could sustain - the movie could have been better at certain points like these, but the overall experience compensated. Hey!, it's based on hardcore comic books after all, and director's Joss Whedon great attention to it's making is clearly noticeable, if you've read the comics.The movie was worth my time, and I give it a seven out of ten. I've seen a couple of better Action Sci-Fi movies, matter of personal preference, and there always must be place for even better ones, since human capabilities can't be imagined. Thus, a seven from me to The Avengers, makes this Action Sci-Fi a must-see to those that agree with me.

2012-07-16,"There are not many films that are good enough (In my opinion) to make me go and see it five times at the cinemas, HOWEVER from start to finish The Avengers was an excellent example of how to develop a reasonably detailed plot-line whilst maintaining an unrelenting series of action sequences.The chemistry between each of the already well established characters was fantastic. Getting a good balance of all personalities with wholesome and righteous from Captain America, sarcastic and nonchalant from Iron Man, zen and rage from Bruce Banner. They really managed to cover all the sides of human emotion and hero stereotypes.At the end of the day if you want the most unexpected, ground shattering storyline with serious real-life connections tho may not be the best movie for you.

2012-04-24,"This is one of the most awaited movies of all time - and for the legions of fans in Asia, the wait is going to be over soon. For those who have not yet booked their tickets, I suggest that they do so, preferably at the IMAX cineplex where the action in 3D can be overwhelming.I must say I was a bit skeptical that writer-director Joss Whedon (creator of TV's ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"") can pull off this six-in-one superhero flick. Will it be like assembling six major egos in a small room - and cramming their style? With the plot of 'six against one (Loki)', wouldn't that be overkill and unfair advantage? Will the storyline/plot measure up to the CGI and effects that take up a major part of its US$220 million budget? Will this Disney effort follow in the heels of John Carter and go downhill? All these doubts are dashed after 20 minutes into the movie - when we find Earth being threatened by demi-god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the head of S.H.I.E.L.D (for Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division) starts The Avenger Initiative. From here on, it is pure, Marvelous fanboy entertainment of the supreme order! You can bet this one is going to put Whedon among the ranks of top directors like Spielberg and Cameron.Those who have seen Captain America last year may remember the Tesseract, the all-powerful energy cube found at the bottom of the ocean. Loki, the megalomaniacal brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) manages to get his hands on it and plans to use it to summon his army of outer space warriors to take over the world.To stop him, Fury and his assistant Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) assemble the various 'superheroes' on his massive 'helicarrier' in preparation for war against Loki's forces. These include Steve Rogers' Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark's Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Dr Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Thor. Special agent Clint Barton, or Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) makes up the sixth member a bit later when Manhattan is being bombarded by outer space monsters.The climactic battle takes up almost all of the final half-hour but the whole movie is absorbing enough, thanks to a cleverly written script that incorporates a fine balance of sincerity and self-effacing wit. Indeed, before the Avengers battle the alien invaders, they fight one another, both physically and verbally. Like, Iron Man's quips when he first meets Thor: ""What's this, Shakespeare in the park?"" and ""Does your mother know you're wearing her drapes?"" Indeed, the punchlines are more powerful - and memorable - than the real punches.Whedon does not waste time re-introducing his characters. We are already familiar with Iron Man, Captain America and Thor. The physical talents of Scar-Jo's Black Widow are 'introduced' in an interrogation scene where she later beats the brains out of her interrogators while she puts her boss Agent Coulson on hold.I have always wondered how Mark Ruffalo will fare as the Hulk - and I am surprised he almost ran away with the show. His Dr Banner is a mellow guy hiding out in India before being 'persuaded' by Natasha to join The Avengers. On board Fury's helicarrier, we can see him doing his utmost to keep his temper in check - ""you must have been doing a lot of yoga"" someone jokes. And yes, when The Hulk emerges, it is really Incredible. Also watch out for Marvel Comics' Stan Lee who gets a self-effacing one-liner during the action scenes.One of the 'misses' of this film is that Natalie Portman's Jane is left out of Thor's story - except for a picture. This is in contrast to Stark's relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) which takes up quite a few scenes. And even though he has to face-off against six superheroes, Hiddleston's Loki is formidable and menacing enough as the arch villain. Of course, Jackson finally has a proper role here after cameos in the previous Iron Man and Captain America films.It really isn't about whether you're going to catch ""The Avengers""; it's how many times you will want to see it.",8.0,2012-04,Tuesday,"3d:0.04, about:0.02, action:0.03, after:0.06, against:0.11, agent:0.09, alien:0.04, all:0.06, almost:0.07, already:0.04, also:0.02, always:0.03, am:0.03, america:0.09, an:0.02, and:0.25, another:0.03, are:0.07, army:0.04, as:0.03, assemble:0.04, at:0.04, avenger:0.04, avengers:0.05, away:0.04, banner:0.06, battle:0.07, be:0.07, been:0.02, before:0.06, being:0.09, bit:0.07, black:0.05, both:0.04, brother:0.04, bruce:0.03, but:0.01, by:0.06, can:0.08, captain:0.09, cgi:0.03, characters:0.02, chris:0.06, comics:0.03, course:0.04, director:0.03, do:0.03, does:0.06, downey:0.03, earth:0.03, effects:0.03, enough:0.06, entertainment:0.04, evans:0.03, even:0.02, face:0.04, fans:0.03, few:0.03, fight:0.03, film:0.02, films:0.03, final:0.04, finally:0.04, find:0.04, first:0.02, for:0.09, found:0.04, from:0.02, fury:0.09, get:0.02, gets:0.04, go:0.03, god:0.04, going:0.09, guy:0.04, half:0.04, has:0.04, have:0.07, hawkeye:0.03, he:0.07, hemsworth:0.03, her:0.12, here:0.06, hiddleston:0.06, him:0.06, his:0.18, hour:0.04, how:0.05, hulk:0.06, in:0.16, incredible:0.03, into:0.03, iron:0.08, is:0.15, isn:0.04, it:0.10, its:0.03, jackson:0.06, jeremy:0.03, johansson:0.03, joss:0.02, jr:0.03, keep:0.04, know:0.03, last:0.03, left:0.04, like:0.06, loki:0.11, lot:0.03, makes:0.03, man:0.08, many:0.03, mark:0.05, marvel:0.02, may:0.04, minutes:0.04, more:0.02, most:0.02, movie:0.03, movies:0.02, must:0.06, nick:0.03, not:0.03, of:0.26, off:0.06, on:0.09, one:0.12, or:0.02, out:0.08, over:0.06, part:0.03, plot:0.05, previous:0.04, put:0.03, quite:0.03, re:0.11, real:0.04, really:0.04, renner:0.03, robert:0.03, role:0.04, ruffalo:0.05, samuel:0.03, say:0.03, scarlett:0.03, scene:0.03, scenes:0.05, script:0.04, see:0.04, seen:0.03, she:0.08, show:0.04, so:0.02, special:0.03, stark:0.06, stop:0.04, story:0.02, storyline:0.04, superhero:0.02, superheroes:0.06, take:0.07, takes:0.08, tesseract:0.04, than:0.02, that:0.08, the:0.48, their:0.04, these:0.05, they:0.04, this:0.09, thor:0.10, those:0.06, though:0.03, time:0.04, times:0.03, to:0.18, tom:0.03, tony:0.03, top:0.03, up:0.11, us:0.04, villain:0.03, wait:0.04, want:0.03, was:0.02, watch:0.02, we:0.08, what:0.02, whedon:0.07, when:0.09, where:0.06, which:0.02, while:0.03, who:0.07, whole:0.03, widow:0.05, will:0.11, with:0.06, world:0.03, written:0.04, year:0.04, yes:0.04, yet:0.04, you:0.09, your:0.03"

2012-05-05,"I'm writing this review from the perspective of an avid comic book collector, and Avengers fan.I absolutely loved the action in this film, from every one of the main characters. They fought like they do in the comic books, especially Captain America. It seems as if he had plenty of time to practice with that shield of his, the choreography of his fight scenes were better, and he showed the agility and super strength this time out. Chris Evans was very solid in portraying him, and acted like a true captain. Very authoritative.Even Thor used his hammer to its full capacity, making the most out of it. He used it to absorb and block kinetic energy, dish out energy in return, and he just felt more powerful than he did in his introductory film. He was a bit too serious in the film, gone was that positive attitude though.Iron man was his usual self, mostly there for comedic elements. Sometimes, it took away from the solemn tone of the action scenes, there were just too many jokes in the heat of battle and found it hard to laugh at times during his jokes. One thing I loved about his fighting scenes was how he used Captain America's shield to deflect his beams. So, so cool. Well choreographed! Now, the Hulk. In a nutshell, well, he stole the show! That's all I'm going to say. He looked so much better then he did in his film just several years ago, my how technology progresses in such short time! Now, the supporting cast did OK, Black Widow got more screen time then I expected. She is fun to watch, a great tough actress Johansson is. As is Renner, too bad he was limited in his action. I won't mention the other performances by Paltrow, Jackson and Skaarsgards...they were all just solid and short.Plotwise, well, nothing that complicated. It was a sublime story, but simple when looked above the surface. Aliens invade through a Stargate/Wormhole. Dark and evil energy is brought forth by the main Protagonist, who was fantastic as usual. Hiddlestone was just as menacing as he was in Thor, a fine actor indeed. Acting wise, he stole the show, and threatened mentally more than physically. That is rare in a Marvel film.Now, if a Marvel film would only have a top name directing it. I mean, DC movies get the best directors, Donner, Burton, Snyder, and Nolan. Am I missing one? The Avengers felt too confusing at times, a comedy for the most part, yet, having the violence and action of a war film. I didn't like that. And as for the 8.8 score and fantastic reviews, well, I can't rate a movie above an 7 if its missing a good soundtrack. Perhaps less CGI and a good composer would add more emotion to the film.

2012-12-30,"The Avengers (AKA: Avengers Assemble) is written and directed by Joss Whedon, with Zak Penn co-writing the story. It stars Robert Downey Junior, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddlestone, Clark Gregg, Samuel L. Jackson, Cobie Smulders and Stellan Skarsgard. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Seamus McGarvey.Asgardian outcast Loki (Hiddlestone) has struck a deal with the Chitauri to exchange the Tesseract for an army with which he can attack Earth and thus control it. With the Earth in mortal danger, S.H.I.E.L.D director Nick Fury (Jackson) activates the Avengers Initiative; a collection of super heroes and deadly assassins who, if they can actually come together as one united force, hold the fate of the Earth in their hands.I have no real frame of reference with The Avengers comic book world, when I was young I read a bit of Spidey, Batman and was kind of partial to The Fantastic Four, but I really don't remember story lines and gave up reading that sort of stuff once sport and exams came into my life. I love movies and as I enter the later stages of my forties I'm pleased to say I have a wide range of film genre interests. I have very much enjoyed The Avengers solo films so far, with the exception of Iron Man 2 which quite frankly is average at best, but the reality is that if The Avengers failed as a movie, that Whedon got it so wrong, then I wouldn't be foaming at the mouth or proclaiming that the director be stripped naked and whipped around the streets of Hollywood! As it is, with one or two minor irks aside, The Avengers is about as much fun as I have had with a movie in quite a few years.I wouldn't know if the makers got the essence right, or if the story is at one in the Marvel Avengers Universe, I just know that it is a right old blast and made a colossal amount of money at the box office, even trumping The Dark Knight Rises in that department. It's a film full of derring-do heroics, ripe witticisms, wonderfully staged action, simmering sexual tensions, ego collisions, charm, heart and splendid human interactions. It looks fabulous on Blu-ray, the art design, the colour photography and Silvestri's score rumbles like thunder and crackles like lightning, just as a super hero movie score should do. The cast performances are hugely enjoyable as they bounce off of one and other, feeding off the respective thespian energy with a knowing of the right tone to make this colourful comic book world be all that it can be. While Whedon, with a weight of expectation akin to Atlas holding the World on his shoulders, comes through with flying colours with astute pacing and an impressive marshaling of an acting army.Flaws? Jackson's Nick Fury could have done with more screen time and Cobie Smulders is sadly short changed as well. The Chitauri are only really a threat because of their sheer numbers, not because of any great alien design, and, well, The Hulk CGI hasn't really advanced much from the 2008 version, but really these are small itches rather than big ones. Is The Avengers the best film of 2012? It will be seen as such for many fans of the source(s) who have waited with baited breath for this coming together of their heroes, and that notion really shouldn't irk the more highbrow film fans out there. Me? No it isn't the best film of 2012, but as I found my self perched on the edge of my seat as the finale unfurls in a wave of explosive heroic energy, and I caressed my ribs from laughing out loud, I knew then that undoubtedly The Avengers is the most fun film of 2012. 9/10",9.0,2012-12,Sunday,"10:0.03, 2012:0.12, about:0.02, acting:0.03, action:0.02, actually:0.04, alien:0.04, all:0.02, amount:0.05, an:0.06, and:0.24, any:0.03, are:0.05, army:0.08, around:0.04, as:0.21, assemble:0.04, at:0.08, avengers:0.17, batman:0.04, be:0.09, because:0.05, best:0.07, big:0.03, bit:0.04, book:0.06, but:0.06, by:0.07, came:0.04, can:0.07, cast:0.03, cgi:0.03, chris:0.06, come:0.03, comes:0.04, comic:0.05, coming:0.04, could:0.03, dark:0.04, director:0.07, do:0.06, don:0.03, done:0.03, downey:0.03, earth:0.10, enjoyed:0.04, evans:0.03, even:0.02, fans:0.07, fantastic:0.04, far:0.04, few:0.03, film:0.12, films:0.03, for:0.05, found:0.04, four:0.05, from:0.04, full:0.04, fun:0.06, fury:0.06, genre:0.04, got:0.07, great:0.02, had:0.03, has:0.02, have:0.11, he:0.02, hemsworth:0.03, hero:0.03, heroes:0.05, his:0.02, hollywood:0.04, hulk:0.02, if:0.09, impressive:0.05, in:0.08, into:0.03, iron:0.02, is:0.14, isn:0.04, it:0.13, jackson:0.10, jeremy:0.04, johansson:0.03, joss:0.03, just:0.04, kind:0.04, knight:0.04, know:0.06, life:0.04, like:0.04, lines:0.04, loki:0.02, looks:0.04, love:0.03, made:0.03, make:0.03, man:0.02, many:0.03, mark:0.03, marvel:0.02, me:0.02, money:0.04, more:0.04, most:0.03, movie:0.04, movies:0.02, much:0.07, my:0.11, nick:0.06, no:0.05, not:0.02, of:0.31, off:0.06, old:0.04, on:0.06, once:0.04, one:0.07, only:0.03, or:0.07, other:0.02, out:0.04, performances:0.04, quite:0.07, rather:0.05, read:0.04, real:0.04, really:0.11, renner:0.03, right:0.10, robert:0.03, ruffalo:0.03, samuel:0.03, say:0.03, scarlett:0.03, screen:0.03, seen:0.03, short:0.04, should:0.03, so:0.04, stars:0.04, story:0.07, stuff:0.05, such:0.03, super:0.06, tesseract:0.04, than:0.02, that:0.13, the:0.50, their:0.07, then:0.06, there:0.02, these:0.03, they:0.04, this:0.03, through:0.04, time:0.02, to:0.06, together:0.05, tom:0.03, two:0.03, universe:0.04, up:0.02, very:0.02, was:0.03, well:0.04, whedon:0.08, when:0.02, which:0.05, while:0.03, who:0.05, will:0.02, with:0.22, world:0.09, writing:0.04, written:0.04, wrong:0.04, years:0.03"
2012-08-25,"This was a highly anticipated title for me and may be for everyone else as well. But when I actually saw this Movie, I don't think this movie deserves this type of rating. Its so much over rated.I don't mean this move is bad, the movie is good but so over rated and you will only find kid's stuff in there. I think this one is really made for little kids. Don't watch this movie expecting something like Iron Man 2 or Thor. It is not very well written and the plot is not very strong, not a serious movie. I think having this type of budged and all the great actors is such a waste. And I believe only the kids have rated it so high.If you want to enjoy this movie then do not expect anything like iron man or Thor, you will be disappointed if you will have those expectations.The major issue with this movie is its script and weak plot, the antagonist is incredibly cheap and stupid as well. They could have used some better ideas. Although there are a lot of special effects and a lot of actions which is good. But it just do not fits it to an 8+ it is an average movie which deserves something 6/10.

2012-09-30,"Has the global situation grown so bleak that the populace has regressed to comic books for escapism entertainment?

To sit in one place for an excess of 2 ½ hours and witness the destruction derby that is the apocalyptic bad guys (in the form of a light spear carrying Loki (Tom Hiddleston) against Samuel L. Jackson's SHIELD cast of make-believe folks - Robert Downey, Jr in armor, Chris Evans in his Captain America Halloween costume, Mark Ruffalo unconvincingly transforming into the Hulk, Chris Hemsworth as hammer wielding Thor, Scarlett Johansson as a pretty Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye all out to make life sustainable for the leasers like Stellan Skarsgård, Clark Gregg, and Colbie Smulders - is a feat in itself.For movies of this type this one has more color and imaginative loco devices that most and therefore I suppose it remains at the top of the heap.

2012-05-11,"I'm not the biggest fan of the setup movies for The Avengers. I think they're tremendously hit and miss, and not through some comic book fan need for accuracy but as stand alone films on their own merits. See, I like the odd comic book, but I'm certainly not a comic book fan. What I am a fan of is good, solid storytelling. You know - characters that evolve, logically sound motivations and tensions, good pacing, an antagonist defeated through skill rather than luck - that sort of thing. From this perspective, the setup movies fell mostly flat for me. Iron Man was fabulous fun but it's sequel was poor. The Hulk was meh. Captain America spent far too long without any actual Captain America in it, and Thor - hmmm was just a bit of an all round mess and lacked even eye candy set pieces to elevate it. So back a few years ago when it first became whispered in nerd circles that The Avengers was going to surface to tie all these movies together, I didn't really get much of a sense of excitement. A few years later, as the end credits rolled on Thor, I pretty much made up my mind that The Avengers movie was going to screw up badly. If the industry couldn't pull off a good movie with just one hero in it, how could they ever pull off one with six?Then I heard that Joss Whedon was writing and directing and my interest rekindled. After all, I've seen him handle symphonies of characters before - with the Scooby Gang and the Serenity crew. If anyone could do it, Whedon could.But still I was wary. Just didn't want to let my expectations get too high - superhero movies are notoriously difficult to get right after all. Maybe even Whedon would screw it up.Boy was I wrong.I don't think I've had this much fun at the cinema in years. Since the first Matrix movie in fact which was, what? Twelve years ago? (God I'm old). The Avengers had everything a good popcorn flick needs - major action setpieces, beautiful sfx, some neat and effective humor, yada yada yada. But none of that is what left my jaw on the floor. What really blew me away - and what compelled me to come here and write the first review I've done on IMDb in quite some time (years probably) - was just how perfectly done the script was. Every character is given their moment to shine, every interaction is perfectly in tune, this whole movie was the audiovisual equivalent of listening to a perfectly wrought symphony. Every moving part clicked into place so well that you couldn't have taken out one single character - not even the arguably 'second tier' characters of Hawkeye and the Black Widow - without the whole thing coming apart. This is no Batman or Pirates of the Caribbean, or Spider Man movie; because while those multi-protagonist movies were all quite adequate and entertaining, the characters and plots were often an out of focus mess. Not so in The Avengers. Everything clicks so perfectly I can't even find the words to describe it.

2012-07-15,"I admit it's been a while since I have seen this film but I have yet to give a proper review. Hopefully, this review can trigger the awesome feelings you had when watching The Avengers.This is what the Marvel movies have been leading up to, that is, every Marvel movie excluding the Spider-Man trilogy. The amount of hype behind this movie was tremendous; while waiting in line for The Avengers, the usher at the theater tells us that ""this is the best movie I have seen in 5 years"". That being said, it's extremely hard to go into this film without any expectations.So the question then is, was The Avengers good? If I can, I would call it Marvel-ous.Let's start with what I really enjoyed. The two strongest parts of The Avengers are the beginning and the end. When the film opens, we get to see the heros in their respective environments. And the opening scene with Black Widow stands out as one of the best. After Loki threatens Earth, the Avengers team has to assemble. Watching the team finally come together after waiting so many years, is a special moment. Now, the end was good because we finally get to see The Avengers work together as a team. While it took the entire movie for the Marvel heros to figure out that they are stronger as a unit than as individuals, it's worth the wait. How the camera panned across each hero who was doing something that effected the next person was stunning. To me, this felt the most like an actual comic book of video game.The humor and writing really stand out as good. I found myself laughing a lot more than I thought at this movie (and that works for this film). The Marvel movies have always been bright and very light hearted at times, and the script really made that aspect shine through.The two sides of the Hulk. The hulk was one of the best parts of this movie along with the relationship between Captain America and Iron man (I hope they set up the Civil War story). However, if I had one flaw with The Avengers, it would be Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner . Honestly, I thought both previous actors (Bana and Norton) played the part better.I know there is a ton more content to this film, but I should save that for when I get the film again on Blu Ray and have a fresh viewing.Overall, The Avengers is a superhero film done right. Everything just seemed to mesh and fall right into place. However, I am not giving it a 10 just yet, because The Dark Knight Rises is coming out soon and I believe that it will be better than The Avengers.9.0out of 10""Better clench up, Legolas""",9.0,2012-07,Sunday,"10:0.07, actors:0.04, after:0.07, again:0.04, along:0.05, always:0.04, am:0.04, america:0.03, amount:0.05, an:0.02, and:0.15, any:0.03, are:0.04, as:0.12, assemble:0.05, at:0.07, avengers:0.18, awesome:0.04, banner:0.04, be:0.04, because:0.06, been:0.09, beginning:0.05, being:0.03, believe:0.05, best:0.08, better:0.10, between:0.04, black:0.03, book:0.04, both:0.04, bruce:0.04, but:0.03, can:0.05, captain:0.03, come:0.03, comic:0.03, coming:0.05, dark:0.04, done:0.04, each:0.03, earth:0.04, end:0.07, enjoyed:0.05, entire:0.05, every:0.03, everything:0.04, expectations:0.04, felt:0.04, film:0.15, finally:0.09, for:0.07, found:0.05, get:0.09, give:0.04, giving:0.05, go:0.03, good:0.07, had:0.06, hard:0.04, has:0.02, have:0.12, hero:0.04, hope:0.05, how:0.03, however:0.08, hulk:0.04, humor:0.04, hype:0.05, if:0.05, in:0.05, into:0.06, iron:0.02, is:0.12, it:0.12, just:0.05, knight:0.04, know:0.03, let:0.04, like:0.02, line:0.05, loki:0.03, lot:0.03, made:0.03, man:0.05, many:0.03, mark:0.03, marvel:0.12, me:0.03, moment:0.05, more:0.05, most:0.03, movie:0.10, movies:0.05, next:0.05, norton:0.05, not:0.02, now:0.04, of:0.11, on:0.02, one:0.06, out:0.10, overall:0.04, part:0.04, parts:0.10, place:0.05, played:0.04, previous:0.04, really:0.08, review:0.09, right:0.08, ruffalo:0.03, said:0.04, save:0.05, scene:0.04, script:0.04, see:0.05, seemed:0.05, seen:0.06, set:0.04, should:0.04, since:0.04, so:0.05, something:0.04, special:0.03, stand:0.05, start:0.04, story:0.03, superhero:0.03, team:0.10, than:0.08, that:0.15, the:0.58, theater:0.05, their:0.03, then:0.03, there:0.02, they:0.05, this:0.16, thought:0.08, through:0.04, times:0.04, to:0.14, together:0.06, two:0.08, up:0.08, us:0.04, very:0.03, wait:0.05, was:0.11, watching:0.07, we:0.06, what:0.05, when:0.08, while:0.12, who:0.03, widow:0.03, will:0.03, with:0.07, without:0.04, work:0.04, worth:0.04, would:0.06, writing:0.05, years:0.08, yet:0.09, you:0.02"
2014-02-02,"Judging from this movie reception we could easily conclude that this is one of the best comic-book movies ever! But, truth be told, it is a pretty generic movie. It has all the favorite clichés: 'the evil' that will destroy the world, we have typical jerk->hero transformation (with pseudo sacrifice) and all the others 'unpredictable' character evolutions... I would call it a well-crafted movie. Action-scenes are good, dialog can be fun sometimes and the acting is nice. It just brings nothing new to the table and it is one of those movies, that you will watch and then remember a couple of scenes/lines from it and later on, you'll just remember a warm fuzzy feeling that it left in you.

2012-05-14,"Only one man in Hollywood that I could think of could take six superheroes and knit them together so seamlessly, giving them each a feeling of value to the team, have such a clever script and get the action sequences to such an exciting level. Whedon, after decades of hard work in television, has finally ascended from cult status and entered the big time with the highest grossing film of all time and an easy contender for one of the best movies in the genre of all time, if not certainly the most entertaining.I went in with very high expectations, expecting to enjoy it, but fearing that the film would be a bit beyond Joss's ability to make great. An ensemble cast of 8 main characters and it being the most anticipated film of the last 5 years with the studio breathing down the filmmakers' necks? That's a tough job description. I figured, it couldn't get better than 7/10, but I should've known not to doubt Whedon.Many will say that this film seems slow paced, but those are people who just want a popcorn flick with minimal character development and dialog. That said, if you pay attention to the dialog, this film manages to draw emotions from the audience, which is rare for a blockbuster type film. The film also manages to keep those scenes succinct enough to keep the audience from lulling. This film was made for the big screen, and was easily the most fun I've had at the theaters in my 28 years.If you are a fan of the comics, you will love how the characters all have their complex attributes displayed, and how all their strengths combine to form a team. You think, ""How will Captain America, Hawkeye or Black Widow be of any use when Iron Man, Hulk and Thor are out wrecking sh*t?"", but there they are adding a dynamic to the team that would sorely needed in their absence. Captain is a born leader, Black Widow is manipulative and cunning, Hawkeye is incredibly reliable support, Iron Man and Thor wreck sh*t, Fury is the soul of the team, and Hulk smashes. The movie spends a lot of time setting things up, but does it so efficiently that you never really find yourself getting tired of all the exposition. As the story moves along, the humor in the script shines. The acting is solid across the board, with exceptional work by Downey who provides much needed lightness and Ruffalo who absolutely nailed Bruce Banner in a way that wasn't whiny and pathetic like Bana's or Norton's. The ending is as somber as it is victorious, and Whedon sets things up for what I hope is a much darker and more introspective sequel.While certainly not the greatest film of all time, for the genre, it couldn't get any better in my opinion. A movie like this is why big theaters exist, and if you wait until it comes out on DVD, you'll be missing out.",9.0,2012-05,Monday,"10:0.04, absolutely:0.05, acting:0.04, action:0.02, after:0.03, all:0.11, along:0.05, also:0.03, america:0.03, an:0.07, and:0.24, any:0.07, are:0.09, as:0.06, at:0.02, audience:0.09, banner:0.04, be:0.07, being:0.04, best:0.03, better:0.07, big:0.10, bit:0.04, black:0.06, blockbuster:0.05, bruce:0.04, but:0.09, by:0.03, captain:0.05, cast:0.04, certainly:0.11, character:0.03, characters:0.05, comes:0.05, comics:0.04, could:0.07, couldn:0.11, development:0.05, does:0.03, down:0.04, downey:0.03, each:0.03, enjoy:0.04, enough:0.04, ensemble:0.05, entertaining:0.04, exciting:0.05, expectations:0.05, fan:0.04, film:0.21, finally:0.05, find:0.05, for:0.09, from:0.07, fun:0.04, fury:0.04, genre:0.10, get:0.09, getting:0.05, giving:0.05, great:0.03, greatest:0.05, had:0.03, hard:0.04, has:0.03, have:0.04, hawkeye:0.07, high:0.04, hollywood:0.05, hope:0.05, how:0.10, hulk:0.05, humor:0.04, if:0.11, in:0.15, iron:0.05, is:0.15, it:0.11, job:0.04, joss:0.03, just:0.02, keep:0.10, last:0.04, like:0.05, ll:0.05, lot:0.04, love:0.04, made:0.03, main:0.04, make:0.03, man:0.07, many:0.03, more:0.03, most:0.09, movie:0.03, movies:0.03, much:0.06, my:0.05, never:0.04, norton:0.05, not:0.06, of:0.21, on:0.02, one:0.04, only:0.03, opinion:0.05, or:0.05, out:0.08, people:0.04, really:0.03, ruffalo:0.03, said:0.05, say:0.03, scenes:0.03, screen:0.03, script:0.09, seems:0.05, sequel:0.05, sequences:0.05, should:0.04, so:0.05, story:0.03, such:0.08, superheroes:0.03, take:0.04, team:0.14, than:0.03, that:0.14, the:0.47, their:0.08, them:0.06, there:0.02, they:0.02, things:0.09, think:0.07, this:0.06, thor:0.05, those:0.08, time:0.13, to:0.16, together:0.03, until:0.05, up:0.05, ve:0.08, very:0.03, wait:0.05, want:0.04, was:0.04, wasn:0.05, way:0.03, went:0.05, what:0.03, whedon:0.09, when:0.03, which:0.03, while:0.04, who:0.09, why:0.04, widow:0.07, will:0.08, with:0.09, work:0.08, would:0.06, years:0.08, you:0.15"
2012-07-22,"Immediately after watching The Avengers, I was confused. All of my friends seemed to love it, the theater roared its approval as the credits rolled, and most of the reviews I've read are overwhelmingly positive. For these reasons, I'm not entirely sure I watched the same movie as everybody else, but I'm perfectly willing to comment on what I saw. The film opens with Loki stealing the Tesseract, an all powerful energy device that poses a significant threat to Earth's security. Thankfully, Nick Fury assembles the ""Avengers"", the group of superheroes who are the focus of the film. Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, and Mark Ruffalo all reprise their roles of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and the Incredible Hulk, while Scarlet Johansson and Jeremy Renner portray the Black Widow and Hawkeye. Every single one of these characters (Loki included) is entirely one-dimensional and frankly, boring to watch. With the possible exception of the Hulk, they are straight-forward, flawless superheroes, who have absolutely no trouble dispatching anyone who crosses them. This makes the prolonged action sequences particularly difficult to watch; you never doubt who is going to prevail. As for the central story of the film, it is a complete mess. It's an action movie in the truest sense of the word; every aspect of the plot is twisted to encourage more fighting sequences, which really prevents the film from moving forward at all. The story doesn't provoke further thought in any way, and really just serves to provide mindless action and downright terrible dialogue. In particular, Downey Jr. relentlessly delivers sarcastic insults every few minutes, which just aren't that funny (in my opinion). Once or twice, I found it amusing, but by the end of the movie I was sick of it. The other characters aren't much better, with the exception of Thor, who had a few funny moments. Despite everything I have said, there's no criticizing how the film looks. The CGI sequences are stunning, and the various locations in the film are visually pleasing. It doesn't break any new ground, but it's still entertaining. Overall, this is not a good movie. The characters are flat, static, uninteresting people portrayed by uninspired actors. The story is atrocious and riddled with holes. The action sequences are painfully long and predictable. And perhaps worst of all, when it was trying so hard to be funny, it simply wasn't. Looking at all the names that contributed to this movie, I am frankly shocked at the finished product. Joss Whedon is a brilliant director and writer (I loved Firefly), and most of the actors (particularly Downey Jr., Renner, and Ruffalo) are usually enjoyable. So I'm not quite sure where everything went wrong, but hopefully they can produce a more thoughtful sequel with their next efforts.

2012-05-08,"I'll make it simple:Best points: Action scenes, Scarlett Johansson, Iron Man, HulkLow points: Captain AmericaI went to see this movie in 2D because i don't like the 3D, but after awhile i was regretting it because the scenes are awesome and must be really great in 3D, even in 2D the Heroes and creatures seem to come inside the cinema.Captain America is so wrongly portrayed here, it's a mix of the old one of the comics in the 60's with the new one of Civil War, when the best comics of Captain America were in the 80's and 90's, he's supposed to be a man, not a kid, he's supposed to have a strong voice, not a sweet women lovable voice, he's supposed to be a bulk, not a normal gym guy, he's supposed to have an armor that shows respect and represents dignity, not a plastic suit that looks a carnival suit for kids, he's supposed to throw his shield like it was easy and light for him, and not heavy or with much effort, the shield it's supposed to be an extension of his arm and not his shoulder, He's supposed to be a leader and not someone who tells jokes, he never makes anyone laugh, he's the moral standards of every group, something that no Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, or other hero can do as him, because apart from his serum and special abilities he represents humanity at his best, not a playboy business man, or a God, or a monster, he's representing the best of mankind and human spirit, he's more then a soldier, and last but not least, he never takes a gun and starts shooting! Apart from that(because Captain America is one of my heroes) i can't give a 9 to this movie, all the scenes are great, Loki isn't that good as everyone says here, a god doesn't spit to a glass while talking, you don't even know if gods have saliva, it's not cool, but anyway i think it deserves a 9.5. Because i can't give that, and, although it doesn't respect Captain America spirit right, it's an awesome movie, 10 stars!Best part of the movie is the scene when Hulk starts fighting the bad guys, you won't get better excitement and thrill then this, not even on the Hulk movies, what a shame for those two...",10.0,2012-05,Tuesday,"10:0.04, 3d:0.10, action:0.03, after:0.04, all:0.02, although:0.06, america:0.13, an:0.09, and:0.24, anyone:0.06, are:0.05, as:0.05, at:0.03, awesome:0.09, bad:0.05, be:0.13, because:0.19, best:0.16, better:0.04, but:0.06, can:0.09, captain:0.16, cinema:0.06, come:0.04, comics:0.10, cool:0.06, do:0.04, doesn:0.10, don:0.07, even:0.10, every:0.04, everyone:0.05, fighting:0.06, for:0.06, from:0.06, get:0.04, give:0.09, god:0.10, good:0.03, great:0.06, group:0.06, guy:0.05, guys:0.06, have:0.07, he:0.39, here:0.09, hero:0.04, heroes:0.07, him:0.09, his:0.17, hulk:0.08, if:0.03, in:0.10, iron:0.06, is:0.05, isn:0.05, it:0.16, johansson:0.05, know:0.04, last:0.05, least:0.06, like:0.06, ll:0.05, loki:0.03, looks:0.06, make:0.04, makes:0.04, man:0.11, more:0.03, movie:0.08, movies:0.03, much:0.03, must:0.05, my:0.03, never:0.09, new:0.05, no:0.04, not:0.27, of:0.16, old:0.06, on:0.03, one:0.07, or:0.13, other:0.03, part:0.05, really:0.03, right:0.05, scarlett:0.05, scene:0.05, scenes:0.12, see:0.03, seem:0.06, simple:0.06, so:0.03, something:0.05, special:0.04, stars:0.06, takes:0.06, that:0.12, the:0.29, then:0.09, think:0.04, this:0.06, thor:0.03, those:0.05, to:0.19, two:0.05, was:0.05, went:0.06, were:0.03, what:0.03, when:0.07, while:0.05, who:0.03, with:0.04, won:0.06, you:0.05"
2012-05-06,"I am a fan of the recent Marvel superhero movies. Spiderman, Iron Man, The Hulk, Thor, and especially Captain America. The Avengers is better than all of those. All of the heroes in The Avengers get a moment to shine on screen, even Nick Fury. Going into the movie I was a little disappointed to know that Loki was going to be the main protagonist, but after seeing the film I can see why this was the case. The Avengers ties a lot of the previous movies together, and having Thor's brother as the bad guy made that more efficient. It's a long movie, but when it was over I didn't feel beat up and ready for the story to be over the way I do when trying to watch an entire Harry Potter movie. Even the Lord of the Rings movies seems too long to me, but thanks to a great story and even better dialog I never became impatient during The Avengers.The standout from The Avengers is clearly The Hulk. You spend most of the movie waiting for him to appear and it's amazing when he finally goes on a rampage. At two points during the movie The Hulk actually got applause from the audience.Highly recommended, I can't wait to see it again.

2012-05-02,"I'm pretty sure I had a grin on my face the whole 2 hours and 20 minutes, including the 20 minutes I waited after the film to check that there wasn't a sneak peek after the credits. It's got a great great story, which is relatively true to the comics. Stan Lee MUST have had a lot of creative input into it. Really makes a difference. Shows why his comics have been around for almost 80 years.Considering how many 'big' characters there are, the character development is fantastic. you really buy in to each of their personal agendas and feelings. The guy who plays the Hulk, is just incredible. Never seen him before, I don't think. He gives you the impression that he is a loaded gun that can crack at any point, fly of the handle and turn into this massive green smashing machine (which obviously he does). The tension is incredible. It's got laugh out loud moments liberally scattered throughout, that was making the whole cinema laugh. Most of them coming from either Robert Downy Jr, or weirdly enough, the Hulk.I have to say I felt really comic book geeky as there was one line that only comic geeks would have got. I laughed and about 4 other people behind me laughed. Ironicially enough we were also the people that stayed until after the credits.The last act has some of the best action sequences that have ever been put on film, period. The CGI, which there is a lot of, didn't feel like CGI. You are so engrossed and it is done so well, that you forget that it actually is CGI.It certainly helps to have a grounding in the Marvel films that preceded it, but it's definitely not necessary. I have seen them all, so I can't be completely certain, but I think you'd do OK even if you haven't. There are some quick flashbacks and some expository dialogue about what's happened in the other films, enough to bring you up to a good enough level to get it, I think. Obviously it's better if you've seen them, though, so if you haven't yet, I highly recommend filling in the gaps. I would say that, in descending order of usefulness, you should see: Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, Iron Man 2, Iron Man, and The Incredible Hulk.. Adding to that, my girlfriend hasn't seen any of them, I thought she would just think it was a geeky film, but she LOVED it, I was shocked. So much so that we'll be watching Iron Man 1 and 2 at her suggestion.I read loads of reviews saying that it is not worth watching in 3-D. I have to say, I completely disagree. There is a lot more they could have done with the 3-D element. For example, Hawkeye, with his arrows would be amazing, you know firing arrows at your face etc, but I prefer the subtle bits of 3-D when you do not even realise. When it doesn't distract you from the film. There are bits at the end of the last act, where there are bits of ash just floating about, in 3-D. Very subtle. Very Good.There is a bit after the initial credits, so stay for a bit, not a lot of people will get the character they show, as it is not a familiar villain, but it does set up for a sequel, which will struggle to top this movie.It is very rare that a movie lives up to the hype, especially for me, but this will be the movie of the year. Spiderman, Batman, will struggle to replicate the success, if they can, they will be amazing too.It's the best superhero film ever made, that's not hyperbole.Oh also Scarlett Johanson is in it and she is my favourite!",10.0,2012-05,Wednesday,"about:0.07, action:0.02, actually:0.03, after:0.11, all:0.02, almost:0.04, also:0.05, amazing:0.06, america:0.02, and:0.10, any:0.05, are:0.09, around:0.04, as:0.03, at:0.08, avenger:0.04, batman:0.04, be:0.09, been:0.05, before:0.03, best:0.04, better:0.03, big:0.03, bit:0.07, book:0.03, bring:0.04, but:0.09, can:0.06, captain:0.02, certainly:0.04, cgi:0.10, character:0.05, characters:0.02, cinema:0.04, comic:0.05, comics:0.07, coming:0.04, could:0.03, credits:0.13, definitely:0.04, development:0.04, dialogue:0.04, didn:0.03, do:0.05, does:0.06, doesn:0.03, don:0.03, done:0.06, each:0.03, end:0.03, enough:0.13, especially:0.03, even:0.05, ever:0.05, face:0.09, fantastic:0.04, feel:0.03, felt:0.04, film:0.09, films:0.05, first:0.02, for:0.07, from:0.04, get:0.05, good:0.04, got:0.10, great:0.04, guy:0.04, had:0.05, has:0.02, have:0.15, haven:0.08, hawkeye:0.03, he:0.07, her:0.04, highly:0.04, him:0.03, his:0.05, hours:0.04, how:0.03, hulk:0.06, hype:0.04, if:0.09, in:0.11, incredible:0.10, into:0.05, iron:0.06, is:0.19, it:0.23, jr:0.03, just:0.06, know:0.03, last:0.07, like:0.02, line:0.04, ll:0.04, lot:0.12, loved:0.04, made:0.03, makes:0.03, making:0.04, man:0.06, many:0.03, marvel:0.02, me:0.05, minutes:0.08, moments:0.03, more:0.02, most:0.03, movie:0.04, much:0.02, must:0.03, my:0.06, never:0.03, not:0.10, of:0.17, on:0.04, one:0.02, only:0.02, or:0.02, other:0.05, out:0.02, people:0.09, point:0.04, pretty:0.03, put:0.03, read:0.04, really:0.07, recommend:0.04, reviews:0.04, robert:0.03, say:0.08, scarlett:0.03, see:0.02, seen:0.11, sequel:0.04, sequences:0.04, set:0.04, she:0.12, should:0.03, show:0.04, so:0.13, some:0.07, story:0.02, superhero:0.02, sure:0.03, that:0.22, the:0.39, their:0.02, them:0.09, there:0.18, they:0.08, think:0.11, this:0.04, thor:0.02, though:0.03, thought:0.03, throughout:0.04, to:0.16, too:0.03, top:0.04, true:0.04, until:0.04, up:0.06, ve:0.03, very:0.07, villain:0.03, was:0.06, wasn:0.04, watching:0.06, we:0.05, well:0.02, were:0.02, what:0.02, when:0.05, where:0.03, which:0.10, who:0.02, whole:0.07, why:0.03, will:0.11, with:0.03, worth:0.04, would:0.09, year:0.04, years:0.03, yet:0.04, you:0.23, your:0.03"
2012-04-28,"This many reviews can't be wrong and now I'm part of that group. I won't spoil it with much details but the script is good, the directing is great and the action is just amazing. The biggest surprise for me was Mark Ruffalo's part. I was highly skeptical because of his look and the Hulk's but after seeing the entire movie I have to agree that he is the best Hulk version thus far. I am simply amaze at both Weldon and Mark's work. Just wow.The are two disappointing things for me though. First is Hawkeye. He's only smiles once in the movie and I bet you'll have a hard time finding that part. This is because I've grew up knowing Hawkeye more as a comedic/serious character and not just a pure serious character. That doesn't mean his part in the movie wasn't great. Second is Banner just showing up and agreeing to fight alongside the team. Sure one can make guesses but I much prefer that one was provided; either as Hulk wanting to protect others as he usually does, or as Banner and Hulk agreeing that he needs to help out so that others see him differently and accept him. But even this is overshadowed immediately by the next 10s after he arrives. That was just jaw dropping for me and the Avenger teammates LOL I have to suggest to those that haven't already watched the movie to pay close attention to the dialog's. Many of the lower reviews, especially from film critics, is because they really don't pay attention to the dialog's and rate it down. Plus, you'll see why I enjoyed the Hulk immensely in this movie.Many people are turned off on the fact that it is an alien invasion scene even the so-called hardcore comic fans. I will have to remind everyone here that for most comic superheroes the big, world killer scenarios are from outer space, from aliens. It doesn't matter if it's DC or Marvel, it's exact SAME situation. It's not a copy of Transformers 3 since Michael Bay made up the story in the first place and did a poor job at it. Transformers 3 is a copy of what comic books have been using for ages.Don't be surprise but eventually Superman will have Doomsday and his portals. Green Lantern is guardian of the UNIVERSE, don't see how one gets upset at an Alien force coming in to destroy Earth or any other planet that is in their area of protection. Batman and the Justice League will have their Aliens and so forth. Really, what are you complaining about then? That there are too much Aliens? How are you going to introduce them then and still remain true to the story? That's what I thought. Mindless comic book fans that ""think"" they know better...pffft.If you're happy with just the superhero fighting human villains on and from Earth fine. Stay that way. But don't go bitching because eventually the story of ALL superheroes will involve aliens. You're precious Batman will involve aliens, it's just not there in the form of movies YET. Joker has a big part in aliens and Earth's destruction. Get with it people.As for people complaining about the lack of character development well the answer is simple. Go and watch the respective movies about the super hero you are disappointed about. There are two Iron movies, 2 Hulks, One captain America, One Thor. And while Black Window and Hawkeye don't have their own movie yet they did have a little history in the movie about them. They are the less popular heroes of the team that's why. So again, why are people even complaining about this issue in the first place?Seriously though I sometimes think people are just too anal to think clearly, even hardcore fans.",9.0,2012-04,Saturday,"about:0.13, action:0.02, after:0.05, again:0.03, alien:0.07, all:0.01, already:0.04, am:0.03, amazing:0.03, america:0.02, an:0.04, and:0.24, any:0.03, are:0.19, as:0.08, at:0.06, avenger:0.04, banner:0.06, batman:0.08, be:0.03, because:0.10, been:0.02, best:0.02, better:0.03, big:0.05, biggest:0.04, black:0.03, book:0.03, both:0.04, but:0.09, by:0.02, can:0.04, captain:0.02, character:0.07, comic:0.10, coming:0.04, development:0.04, did:0.05, disappointed:0.04, does:0.03, doesn:0.07, don:0.12, down:0.03, earth:0.10, enjoyed:0.04, entire:0.04, especially:0.03, even:0.09, everyone:0.03, fact:0.04, fans:0.10, far:0.03, fight:0.03, fighting:0.04, film:0.02, first:0.07, for:0.09, from:0.08, get:0.02, gets:0.04, go:0.05, going:0.03, good:0.02, great:0.04, group:0.04, hard:0.04, has:0.02, have:0.15, haven:0.04, hawkeye:0.08, he:0.11, help:0.04, here:0.03, hero:0.03, heroes:0.02, highly:0.04, him:0.06, his:0.07, how:0.05, hulk:0.09, if:0.04, in:0.13, iron:0.02, is:0.17, it:0.12, job:0.03, just:0.15, know:0.03, less:0.04, little:0.03, ll:0.07, look:0.04, made:0.02, make:0.03, many:0.08, mark:0.05, marvel:0.02, me:0.07, more:0.02, most:0.02, movie:0.09, movies:0.06, much:0.07, next:0.04, not:0.05, now:0.03, of:0.13, off:0.03, on:0.04, once:0.04, one:0.08, only:0.02, or:0.06, other:0.02, others:0.07, out:0.02, own:0.03, part:0.16, people:0.14, place:0.08, re:0.07, really:0.04, reviews:0.08, ruffalo:0.03, same:0.03, scene:0.03, script:0.03, second:0.04, see:0.06, seeing:0.03, serious:0.09, simple:0.04, simply:0.04, since:0.03, so:0.07, still:0.03, story:0.07, super:0.03, superhero:0.02, superheroes:0.06, sure:0.03, team:0.06, that:0.23, the:0.40, their:0.07, them:0.05, then:0.06, there:0.06, they:0.08, things:0.03, think:0.08, this:0.06, thor:0.02, those:0.03, though:0.06, thought:0.03, time:0.02, to:0.16, too:0.05, transformers:0.08, true:0.04, two:0.06, universe:0.04, up:0.06, ve:0.03, was:0.06, wasn:0.04, watch:0.02, watched:0.04, way:0.03, well:0.02, what:0.06, while:0.03, why:0.09, will:0.11, with:0.04, won:0.04, work:0.03, world:0.03, wrong:0.04, yet:0.07, you:0.12"
2012-09-06,"You can sum up Avengers in one wordFUN. Some of the world's greatest comic book characters all together in one movie, kicking ass to save us puny humanswho wouldn't want to see that? And as great as it is to see the Avengers come together to save the world, some of the most fun is had when they butt heads and pound on each other just like in the comics. Iron Man vs. Thor, Thor vs. Hulk, Iron Man vs. Captain America.great stuff.Director Joss Whedon does a solid job showcasing all the Avengers without forcing too much story into one movie. Rounding out the individual superhero movies that have been leading up to this was no easy challenge. From Jon Favereau's good Iron Man movies, to the marginal Captain America, and the abysmal Thor pic. Whedon molds the good and bad that he had to work with from the past stories and made an entertaining film.I'm not so sure I would crown The Avengers as the top comic book movie of all time (which is currently still The Dark Knight in my mind), but it was a blast seeing all the Marvel characters finally uniting in the same movie.

Well... there is no story, just special effects - lots of them. There is no plot. Nothing makes sense, unless you know the characters' backgrounds ...and if you do, you will think this movie should be at least an hour longer, so the screenwriter could squeeze some actual dialogues in between all the action. If you take away all the eye-candy, this movie would be less than 15 minutes long - major flunk, imo. This is a movie to forget about.

2012-06-03,"Unless you are the sort of cinematic snob who can only appreciate avant-garde short subjects in tiny projection rooms, then chances are pretty good that you'll have a rollicking good time watching this 2012 megawatt adventure epic. I certainly did, and I wouldn't consider myself a die-hard Marvel comic book fan. I enjoyed the derring-do and ironic humor that infused the comic book films preceding this one, but director/screenwriter Joss Whedon really whips together all the formula elements that made ""Iron Man"" (1 & 2), ""The Incredible Hulk"" (the 2008 version), ""Thor"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" purely entertaining into something that miraculously makes the larger-than-life dimensions of the superheroes more instantly relatable. A top-notch cast certainly helps as does the armada of technicians who pull off the effects in all their 3-D, eye-popping glory, of course, but much of the credit really needs to go to Whedon for making this film as much fun as a comic book.Running a surprisingly fleet 143 minutes, the potentially convoluted plot allows Nick Fury, a character heretofore limited to tantalizing post-credits scenes in the previous movies, to take center stage. He's the surly one-eyed leader of S.H.I.E.L.D., the peacekeeping agency who must quickly recruit a team of superheroes to do battle with Loki, the deceitful half-brother of Thor, the Norse deity of thunder. Loki has brainwashed archer supreme Hawkeye and brilliant physicist Dr. Erik Selvig (already seen in ""Thor"") while stealing a cosmic cube called the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of seemingly limitless potential, from a remote research facility. Fury recruits Black Widow, a former Russian spy last seen in action in ""Iron Man 2"", to gather the troops including a highly reticent Bruce Banner a.k.a. the Hulk. Meanwhile, Iron Man, Captain America and Thor have to learn to get along before facing the enemy.Loki turns out to be the least of their problems as the Tesseract unleashes a powerful alien race known as the Chitauri, which leads to the inevitable battle royale on the devastated streets of Manhattan. While the state-of-the-art action scenes are everything you want them to be, it's really the film's unexpected sense of humor that consistently buoys the story. Realizing the escalating level of implausibility, Whedon smartly provides clever lines and scenes to everyone (and not just Robert Downey, Jr.) For instance, after Thor proclaims Loki solemnly as his Asgardian brother, Black Widow points out that he killed eighty people in two days to which Thor points out Loki was adopted. Later, in the most crowd-pleasing scene, the Hulk grabs a character by his leg and whip-slams him into the floor like he's beating a dust rag. The defiance of logic and physics is par for the course here, and Whedon's kid-like attitude and deft hand make it all the more exhilarating.The physically fit cast work surprisingly well together as an ensemble. While Downey's scene-stealing as Iron Man is a given, Chris Evans' Captain America, Chris Hemsworth's Thor, Mark Ruffalo's digitally altered Hulk, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye all get their moments to shine. As Loki, Tom Hiddleston effectively conveys the inferiority complex that drives his villain with slithery cunning, while Samuel L. Jackson and Clark Gregg take full advantage of expanded roles as Fury and Agent Coulson respectively. The mistake most filmmakers make in showing an Armageddon situation is applying too much soul-baring gravitas to the proceedings. That's definitely not Whedon's take as he never lets us forget that we are watching a comic book come to life. It's gratifying to watch a popcorn movie that actually lives up to the hype in all its commercial glory.",9.0,2012-06,Sunday,"2012:0.04, action:0.04, actually:0.04, after:0.03, agent:0.05, alien:0.04, all:0.08, along:0.04, already:0.04, america:0.07, an:0.04, and:0.18, are:0.08, as:0.20, avenger:0.04, banner:0.03, battle:0.07, be:0.04, before:0.03, black:0.08, book:0.13, brilliant:0.04, brother:0.08, bruce:0.04, but:0.03, by:0.02, can:0.02, captain:0.07, cast:0.07, certainly:0.09, character:0.05, chris:0.07, cinematic:0.05, come:0.03, comic:0.11, course:0.08, credits:0.05, definitely:0.04, did:0.03, director:0.03, do:0.06, does:0.03, downey:0.06, effects:0.03, enjoyed:0.04, ensemble:0.05, entertaining:0.04, epic:0.04, evans:0.04, everyone:0.03, everything:0.03, fan:0.03, film:0.04, films:0.03, first:0.03, for:0.05, from:0.02, full:0.04, fun:0.03, fury:0.10, get:0.05, given:0.04, go:0.03, good:0.04, half:0.04, hard:0.04, has:0.02, have:0.04, hawkeye:0.06, he:0.10, hemsworth:0.04, here:0.03, hiddleston:0.03, highly:0.05, him:0.03, his:0.08, hulk:0.08, humor:0.07, hype:0.04, in:0.14, incredible:0.04, into:0.06, iron:0.09, is:0.04, it:0.04, its:0.03, jackson:0.04, jeremy:0.04, johansson:0.04, joss:0.03, jr:0.03, just:0.02, last:0.04, least:0.04, life:0.08, like:0.04, lines:0.04, ll:0.04, loki:0.15, made:0.03, make:0.06, makes:0.03, making:0.04, man:0.09, mark:0.03, marvel:0.02, minutes:0.04, moments:0.04, more:0.05, most:0.06, movie:0.01, movies:0.02, much:0.08, must:0.04, never:0.03, nick:0.03, not:0.04, of:0.22, off:0.03, on:0.02, one:0.04, only:0.03, out:0.07, people:0.03, plot:0.03, pretty:0.04, previous:0.04, really:0.07, renner:0.04, robert:0.03, ruffalo:0.03, samuel:0.04, scarlett:0.03, scene:0.07, scenes:0.09, seen:0.06, sense:0.04, short:0.05, something:0.03, story:0.02, superheroes:0.06, take:0.11, team:0.03, tesseract:0.09, than:0.03, that:0.15, the:0.53, their:0.07, them:0.03, then:0.03, this:0.04, thor:0.16, time:0.02, to:0.24, together:0.05, tom:0.03, too:0.03, top:0.04, two:0.04, up:0.02, us:0.04, villain:0.03, want:0.04, was:0.02, watch:0.03, watching:0.07, we:0.03, well:0.02, whedon:0.13, which:0.05, while:0.14, who:0.08, widow:0.09, with:0.03, work:0.03, you:0.06"

2012-08-17,"What can I say about the Avengers that everyone else hasn't already said? Well, believe the hype! it's great! why? well numerous reasons. One of them is the director they chose for the job of bringing one of the most iconic super teams in comics to life.Joss Whedon has showed time and time again that he knows about both the Marvel Universe (see his run on Astonishing X-men) and Team dynamics(See Firefly or any of his other works)and he works his magic to the max here. another reason is the great cast. while all good, two performances really stand out to me. The first one is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk and the second one is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. While I enjoyed Ed Norton's Banner, I felt something was missing from him, Likability. Mark Ruffalo had Likability. Tom Hiddleston's Loki was a great villain that really had that sinister aura about him and he's better here than he was in Thor. Another Reason is the action. Not only does the final scene have An epic battle that rivals Robots trashing Chicago in Transformers 3 (This is way cooler) But other great action scenes come throughout the movie. one of my favorites is the scene at the beginning where Loki steals the Tesseract/Cosmic Cube and takes down a whole bunch of S.H.I.E.L.D agents including Nick Fury and Hawkeye. Also, The plot is fairly simplistic but what really makes this movie shone is the character dynamics. So final verdict: possibly the best movie of the summer of 2012.

2014-12-06,"Between a massive advertising blitz and some none-too-subtle hints that Marvel has been dropping in their films for the last four years, Joss Whedon's Avengers adaptation is one of the most eagerly anticipated blockbusters in recent memory. With most of Marvel's flagship characters- played by some of Hollywood's biggest stars- assembled together in a big budget production co-written and directed by the man responsible for Buffy and Firefly, the premise alone is enough to make fanboys swoon. This is a project with some very high expectations to meet. And having seen it, I for one would say that it has met them.It would not be much of a stretch to say that the Avengers is what every summer blockbuster wants to be. Given a few hundred million dollars and near total creative control, what director wouldn't want to make a film like this. In its two and a half hour running time, it delivers a coherent storyline, several likable, well developed protagonists, and enough action and explosions to show up Michal Bay.I mention this notorious director because his Transformers films, particularly the latter entries, have made millions on the idea that brainless fight scenes, gratuitous pyrotechnics, and more than a little T&A are all it takes to make an action movie; no acting, writing, wit, or originality needed. But Avengers shows that that's not true. Like a certain other superhero franchise due to release its final installment later this summer, Avengers works as much because of its human drama as its action and special effects. One of the main reasons the Fantastic Four movies didn't work, aside from weak screenplays and wooden acting, was that we never bought the idea that the actors on screen were a team. In the first film, they utterly lacked the kind of chemistry that would be expected of friends and co-workers. In the second entry, the chemistry was so forced that they seemed like a sitcom family. Avengers suffers from neither of these problems. Chris Evens, Chris Hemsworth, Robert Downy Junior, Scarlett Johansen, Samuel L Jackson, and Mark Ruffalo not only shine on their own, but also work seamlessly together as part of a team, playing of each other's strengths and personalities.Between Stark's cynicism, casual arrogance, and roguish charm, Cap's loyalty and earnestness, Banner's demur, unobtrusive nerdiness, and Thor's zeal and new found humility, all of the leads get the chance to establish themselves as well rounded characters, and to remind us why we liked them in the first place. And like a real team, the characters don't always get along from the moment they first meet. They keep secrets. They question each others' motivations and commitments. They get on each others' nerves. And they certainly let their egos clash. In fact, some of the best fight scenes are between the heroes. But like real people, they put aside their differences and their egos. They learn to trust each other and work together, in a way not nearly as sappy or clichéd as it suddenly sounds when I'm writing it. The casting of Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury continues to seem like a better and better idea all the time. He might not be able to go all out, what with this being a PG-13 production, but there were moments that, for me at least, very much invoked fond memories of Pulp Fiction. Tom Hiddleston also does very good work as the villainous Loki. His air of condescension and supreme self confidence makes him instantly loathable, and the hint of jealousy and subtle desperation in his voice, together with his piercing, wide eyed stare gives the unmistakable impression that something is definitely not right inside his head. Watching the heroes give him the beating he deserves is a supremely satisfying experience.And like I said, the action is great too. The numerous fights and shootouts are excellently choreographed and filmed, and the climactic alien invasion is stunning in its size and complexity. It's like a non-sucky Battlefield LA, and the cost must have been astronomical. I'm also highly impressed at how long the film was able to keep the action and sense of excitement going. From start to finish, the final battle lasted roughly half an hour, without getting bogged down or becoming overly repetitive.Add in some typically Whedon-esque humor and a fair number of insider references to the comics, Avengers is mighty entertainment, and everything that fans could have hoped for. I look forward to Marvel's inevitable follow-up, and to the director's next project. I don't know why it's taken so long, but Joss Whedon has finally arrived in Hollywood, and I expect to see much more of him in the near future.",9.0,2014-12,Saturday,"able:0.08, acting:0.06, action:0.08, actors:0.03, alien:0.03, all:0.05, along:0.04, also:0.07, always:0.03, an:0.04, and:0.40, are:0.05, as:0.12, at:0.04, avengers:0.09, banner:0.03, battle:0.03, be:0.06, because:0.05, been:0.04, being:0.03, best:0.02, better:0.05, between:0.08, big:0.02, biggest:0.04, blockbuster:0.03, but:0.07, by:0.04, certainly:0.04, characters:0.05, chris:0.06, comics:0.03, could:0.02, definitely:0.03, didn:0.03, director:0.08, does:0.03, don:0.05, down:0.03, each:0.09, effects:0.02, enough:0.06, entertainment:0.04, every:0.03, everything:0.03, expect:0.03, expectations:0.03, expected:0.04, experience:0.04, fact:0.03, fans:0.03, fantastic:0.03, few:0.03, fight:0.06, film:0.05, films:0.05, final:0.07, finally:0.03, first:0.06, for:0.07, found:0.04, four:0.08, franchise:0.04, from:0.07, fury:0.03, get:0.07, getting:0.04, give:0.03, given:0.03, go:0.02, going:0.03, good:0.02, great:0.02, half:0.07, has:0.06, have:0.05, having:0.03, he:0.04, hemsworth:0.03, heroes:0.05, hiddleston:0.03, high:0.03, highly:0.04, him:0.08, his:0.10, hollywood:0.08, hour:0.08, how:0.02, humor:0.03, idea:0.12, in:0.17, is:0.10, it:0.10, its:0.12, jackson:0.06, joss:0.05, keep:0.07, kind:0.03, know:0.03, last:0.03, least:0.03, let:0.03, like:0.14, liked:0.04, little:0.03, loki:0.02, long:0.06, look:0.03, made:0.02, main:0.03, make:0.07, makes:0.03, man:0.02, mark:0.02, marvel:0.06, me:0.02, might:0.04, moment:0.04, moments:0.03, more:0.04, most:0.05, movie:0.01, movies:0.02, much:0.08, must:0.03, never:0.03, new:0.03, next:0.03, nick:0.03, no:0.02, not:0.09, of:0.21, on:0.06, one:0.05, only:0.02, or:0.06, other:0.06, others:0.07, out:0.02, own:0.03, part:0.03, people:0.03, place:0.04, played:0.03, put:0.03, real:0.07, right:0.03, robert:0.02, ruffalo:0.02, said:0.03, samuel:0.06, say:0.05, scarlett:0.03, scenes:0.05, screen:0.02, second:0.03, see:0.02, seem:0.04, seemed:0.04, seen:0.02, sense:0.03, show:0.03, so:0.03, some:0.10, something:0.03, special:0.03, stark:0.03, stars:0.04, start:0.03, storyline:0.04, summer:0.08, superhero:0.02, takes:0.04, team:0.08, than:0.02, that:0.16, the:0.39, their:0.10, them:0.04, there:0.02, these:0.02, they:0.16, this:0.06, thor:0.02, time:0.04, to:0.20, together:0.08, tom:0.03, too:0.05, transformers:0.04, true:0.04, two:0.03, up:0.04, us:0.03, very:0.06, want:0.03, wants:0.04, was:0.04, watching:0.03, way:0.02, we:0.05, well:0.04, were:0.04, what:0.06, whedon:0.07, when:0.02, why:0.06, with:0.05, without:0.03, work:0.11, would:0.06, writing:0.08, written:0.04, years:0.03"
2012-05-07,"OK glad to start doing reviews on IMDb. The Avengers 'WHAT A MOVIE' seems to be the line on everybody's lips. Well I am going to say after seeing it both 3D and 2D that I can make an honest objective opinion.The special effects which whether you like it or not is one of the movie's highlights. YES they are GOOD and nicely done BUT why the 3D? Why did I pay for a 3D movie where the 3D was never used in his pure awesomeness? Yes it's cheesy and cheap to see boulders, pieces of buildings tires, arrows explosions and all sort of stuff flying towards you but it's ALSO FUN & that's why you go to see it in 3D. Well let me tell you this movie HAS NONE of that. No Sir it's just simple digital 3D shots of New York and other stuff! NOTHING SPECIAL...sad to see that after 3-4 years AVATAR still holds the CROWN it should give you an idea about this.Acting is good all the way to great. AND YES Tony Stark (Robert Downey JR. steals the show) which can be good if your a fan like me but can also be bad for the rest of the crew. He is great the others are OK. HULK is amazing but then again he is CGI!The story and here is where it starts to get annoying. Guys some of these characters did not have they're own movie so it's hard to relate to them get to care for them especially when you won't have enough time to do so...So why so much Black Widow? Then again why no drama no connections between them. I honestly expected to see Captain America fall for Black Widow as the comic books say. Still it's the 1st part so there is time but make's you feel like you haven't been treated with the whole cake but a cookie.Going to the action scene is where I get disappointed! Alien Invasion??? Where in the middle of New York with no real damage to the city. What happened to the BIG BOOMS and explosions. Where the hell was the ARMY? Where were all those special weapons STARK created for so long. Where the hell was WAR MACHINE as the Air Force Commander. No Sir here you will only see a bunch of cops (fat ones also) fighting alongside our 6 fellas to protect the city. And the only idea the government has is to NUKE the city 10 minutes after the invasion. Very ORIGINAL it was one of those sad moments in my life as a movie enthusiast where I actually did MISSED Michael Bay and his explosions and action scenes. Again you can make an idea about the War Scene.Ending this review with my last disappointment! I know I know it'a a PG movie but PLEASE stop making it so if you going to loose every bit of drama left in the movie.

2012-05-06,"Superman: The Movie, The Dark Knight and The Avengers. Yes ""The Avengers"" does indeed stand tall amongst the greatest superhero movies of all time.A stellar cast assemble to create a marvel of a film, pun definitely intended. The special effects are top notch and never look out of place like superhero movies of the past. However it is truly the story that is most appreciated since it is the final act of an intricate tightly woven plot that has been building through the current generation of Marvel films (Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger) and ends with the best superhero finale ever conceived for the big screen. Yes its that good. The only factor that could have been reduced was the amount of humour and sarcasm following certain kick-ass scenes which could have benefited with a touch of cool. In retrospect the humour mostly gets it right and compliments the ""comic book"" feel of the movie, which is what we have all desperately wanted for so long: A comic book movie that truly sets your mind free like the comic books and cartoons we all read and watched growing up thinking anything was possible.I applaud you Marvel as ""The Avengers"" now stands as one of the greatest, if not the greatest superhero movie of all time.",10.0,2012-05,Sunday,"all:0.12, america:0.04, amount:0.09, an:0.04, and:0.19, anything:0.07, are:0.04, as:0.07, assemble:0.08, avenger:0.08, avengers:0.10, been:0.10, best:0.04, big:0.06, book:0.12, captain:0.04, cast:0.06, comic:0.15, cool:0.08, could:0.11, dark:0.07, definitely:0.07, does:0.06, effects:0.05, ever:0.06, feel:0.07, film:0.04, films:0.05, final:0.08, first:0.05, for:0.06, gets:0.07, good:0.04, greatest:0.26, has:0.04, have:0.10, however:0.07, hulk:0.04, humour:0.18, if:0.04, in:0.03, incredible:0.07, iron:0.04, is:0.10, it:0.07, its:0.05, knight:0.08, like:0.08, long:0.07, look:0.07, man:0.04, marvel:0.12, mind:0.08, most:0.05, movie:0.11, movies:0.08, never:0.06, not:0.03, now:0.06, of:0.26, one:0.03, only:0.05, out:0.04, past:0.09, place:0.08, plot:0.06, read:0.08, right:0.06, scenes:0.05, screen:0.06, since:0.07, so:0.04, special:0.06, stand:0.09, story:0.05, superhero:0.19, that:0.14, the:0.52, thor:0.04, through:0.07, time:0.08, to:0.02, top:0.07, truly:0.17, up:0.04, was:0.06, watched:0.07, we:0.11, what:0.04, which:0.10, with:0.06, yes:0.16, you:0.03, your:0.06"

2012-04-27,"I rarely review any movie titles, purely because I watch so many films it would be impossible to review them all. Avengers Assemble however was a special case.I not only rate this as the best comic book movie ever crafted, but also as one of the best films ever made. It had heart, comedy, action, animation, character development, suspense; all neatly encompassed in a smooth and flawlessly flowing Joss Whedon storyline.Each character has his/her moment of glory and not one of the actors/actresses feel short of the high expectations placed upon their shoulders. Chris Evans as Captain America is and always will be my favourite character in this Marvel film series and he shined brighter than ever in his second role reprisal.I cannot more highly insist you see this film whilst it is IN THE CINEMAS!

2012-05-07,"I went into this movie with an assumption. I figured that the action scenes would be awesome. Marvel had shown that they were very capable of great action sequences and this would be no exception.However, action alone doesn't make a good movie (matrix sequels). This was the part that I was worried about. Would the story and characters be good enough to match the explosive action? The answer is a resounding YES! Great character interactions, hilarious dialog, a true comic book story (not deep like Dark Knight but fun like Iron Man). All of the characters have roles that feel natural and the dialog flows. Robert Downey Jr getting Joss Whedon lines is as good as it sounds and I never realized how hilariously awesome the hulk could be.There are a few problems I had with the movie such as Captain America's back story, no wait I really just hated the Captain America movie.

2012-11-19,"Loki opens a portal to steal the tesseract right from under Fury's nose while converting two of Fury's sidekicks to his cause. He plans on opening a giant portal so that aliens can invade the earth and he can become the ruler over earthlings.Fury starts the Avenger initiative. Get all heroes, superheroes, semiheroes together to save the planet- even though his council doesn't agree entirely. So we get the scenes of these guys being recruited for the mission- as usual for heroes, against their will. There's Iron Man and the Hulk and their normal selves, some Russian agent chick, Captain America, and even Thor shows up.For more than an hour they fight amongst each other as is required of movie characters these days. But they do capture Loki in the process. Oddly he seems to want to be there. They realize he's up to something and the Russian chick is sent to find out what that is. It turns out to be rather underwhelming. Now Loki's people attack the flying aircraft carrier where everybody is. That forces these goofs to join forces and get serious.Loki escapes, opens the portal, aliens attack NY, the avengers respond and have to find a way to close the portal. But Fury wasn't entirely honest with them. He's up to something.Everything goes pretty much by the numbers. Loki is the star here by far. Of the heroes, Downey's character is the only somewhat memorable one. He manages to be a bit funny, cocky, but not too arrogant. Renner is pretty intense and interesting. Thor is likable. The other's don't do a whole lot. Jackson as always plays himself, or rather a caricature of himself. Why does he still get hired? The Avengers isn't as awesome as Thor nor as awful as Captain America. It's somewhere in between. Your standard summer blockbuster with serious CGI carnage a bit too reminiscent of some Transformers movie. We clearly don't need to see another movie with giant alien worms destroying skyscrapers, please. Whedon did his work and saved this from becoming some crappy Michael Bay clone. The script and dialog are alright. The whole idea just doesn't work all too well for me. All these ridiculous heroes-some human, others superhuman, others CGI, together. At least when it's all and said and done it's somewhat exhilarating but about 40 minutes too long. Intros are fine but we don't need that much of an intro let alone the obnoxious bickering amongst the main characters.",7.0,2012-11,Monday,"about:0.03, against:0.06, agent:0.06, alien:0.05, all:0.09, always:0.05, america:0.06, an:0.06, and:0.20, another:0.05, are:0.05, as:0.17, at:0.03, avenger:0.06, avengers:0.05, awesome:0.05, be:0.08, become:0.06, being:0.04, between:0.04, bit:0.10, blockbuster:0.06, but:0.11, by:0.06, can:0.06, captain:0.06, cgi:0.10, character:0.03, characters:0.06, did:0.04, do:0.08, does:0.04, doesn:0.10, don:0.11, done:0.05, downey:0.04, each:0.04, earth:0.05, even:0.07, everything:0.05, far:0.05, fight:0.05, find:0.11, for:0.08, from:0.06, funny:0.05, fury:0.17, get:0.14, goes:0.06, guys:0.06, have:0.02, he:0.22, here:0.04, heroes:0.15, his:0.10, hour:0.06, hulk:0.03, idea:0.06, in:0.04, interesting:0.06, iron:0.03, is:0.14, isn:0.05, it:0.07, jackson:0.05, just:0.03, least:0.05, let:0.05, loki:0.16, long:0.05, lot:0.04, main:0.05, man:0.03, me:0.03, minutes:0.06, more:0.03, movie:0.06, much:0.07, need:0.11, not:0.02, now:0.04, of:0.12, on:0.03, one:0.02, only:0.04, or:0.03, other:0.07, others:0.11, out:0.06, over:0.04, people:0.04, pretty:0.10, rather:0.12, renner:0.05, right:0.05, said:0.05, save:0.06, scenes:0.04, script:0.05, see:0.03, seems:0.06, serious:0.13, so:0.05, some:0.13, something:0.09, star:0.06, still:0.04, summer:0.06, superheroes:0.04, tesseract:0.06, than:0.03, that:0.08, the:0.39, their:0.06, them:0.03, there:0.06, these:0.16, they:0.08, this:0.02, thor:0.09, though:0.05, to:0.24, together:0.07, too:0.15, transformers:0.06, two:0.05, up:0.09, want:0.05, wasn:0.05, way:0.04, we:0.11, well:0.03, what:0.03, whedon:0.04, when:0.03, where:0.04, while:0.05, whole:0.10, why:0.05, will:0.03, with:0.07, work:0.09, your:0.04"
2012-05-07,"Wow, it has finally arrived. Marvel has had one hell of a project, coming up with movies exploring the origin stories of some of the most iconic superheroes of all time while adding small but subtle connections to each other as a way to show fans what is coming over the horizon. The result is an all-out marvel mash as Earth's mightiest heroes have come together to face a threat no one hero could possibly face alone. They are the Avengers.Loki, the god of mischief, has come to conquer the Earth with an unspeakable alien force to back him up. To make matters worse, he has obtained an ancient artifact with virtually limitless power as his disposal. In desperation, Nick Fury, director of the peace-keeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., assembles together the greatest heroes the world has ever seen: Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Incredible Hulk. If these extraordinary independent individuals can learn to work together, their combined might be enough to conquer this global threat.This is every comic book geeks dream team and dream movie. The faces we have all grown up with and come to love finally together in one film. Normally, such a task is highly risky because not only do the filmmakers have to be faithful to the comics, but also appeal to what the fans would want to see in The Avengers, not to mention avoid any plot holes. Thankfully, this movie does it all plus more. It is, dare I say it, incredible! The action scenes are some of the best in the superhero genre, lots of shooting, punching, and, of course, smashing. Things get really insane and everything in sight gets totally destroyed as the forces of good and evil duke it out. All the characters have practically equal back story, interactions, and amount of fighting, even characters like Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Nick Fury. With this, not one seems left out or doesn't get enough of these elements. Dialog is written very well and there's a surprising amount of comedy throughout the film (and it's hard not to laugh with it). There's lots of great moments and none of it seems the least bit corny.In conclusion, this will satisfy anyone, especially the fans. Everything people hope to see is brought to life and it kicks serious butt. With fantastic action scenes, excellent special effects, well-written script, cool music, and surprisingly great comedy, The Avengers is sure to satisfy in every way. On a scale of one to ten, I would give this movie a twenty (it's a shame I can't physically give such a rating)! Go check out this awesome flick and enjoy!

2012-04-28,"Here is the movie they were preparing us for. 'Iron Man'. 'Captain America'. 'Thor'. This was where they would eventually go. And brother, it didn't disappoint. Joss Whedon's magnum opus boasts more stars than the paramount logo and more capable direction and a more taut script than most of the so-called 'superhero' movies made. The movie featured an interesting mix of Marvel heroes coming together as a team when the Earth is in crisis, to save the world. From a spectacular intro where Loki arrives unexpectedly at SHIELD hq to the brilliant final showdown, 'Avengers' is a thrill ride, never letting go. This is *the* summer blockbuster that people should be lining up to see. Lots of action, lots of thrills, superheroes and and a badass villain. Every scene of the film is dripping with homages to superhero fiction. The one liners are numerous and never seem forced. Iron man's quips are just as well timed as always. Enhancing the action and thrills is the soul of the film which lies in its subtle use of emotions. Joss Whedon has done a remarkable job in adding a huge wave of emotion that runs over the film. Iron man is the machine with a heart, who never shows it. the Hulk is the definition of all heart and no mind to control it. And most surprising of all, Black Widow comes with a beautifully nuanced performance. All hints of fear, love and hatred evident in her subtle reactions. Scarlett Johansson is a casting choice to be applauded, as is Mark Ruffalo since I now cannot imagine anyone doing better justice to the role. The only flaw I could think up was the Marvel universe as such. I don't understand why the X-men weren't considered for the Avengers program (legal rights to the characters issues).

2014-05-04,Avengers is a movie that is must watch for everyone but still i don't get one thing.......why was all the plot so artificial.The fight sequence is beautiful and there are lot of awesome moments. I just wonder if such a technology was used properly. Until the end the whole system and everyone seems to be just acting to support some story which was terribly boring. none of the intelligent mind can grasp it positively. Everything was so much made up that it feels as if it was made just to maintain a length until the fight scenes can be filmed. Its terrible that the producer even invested in such a weak project. The effect with hulk are the main attraction. most of the characters in my opinion degraded their image as a superhero during UN-REQUIRED fight shots.For me this was a super enjoyable movie but i would love to see it using forward button.

2013-12-10,"The Avengers falls nowhere short of delivering a fiery and action packed roller coaster ride of explosions. The movie spends its time passing on the spotlight to each avenger, showing off his or her unique ways of dominating enemies and overcoming hazardous obstacles. Seeing all of our favorite superheroes unite under one common enemy is an exciting thought and was inevitable from one day working its way into a movie. Having an army of superheroes to save the world from utter destruction isn't always a bad thing, but for a film, sometimes less is more. While The Avengers offers many good fighting scenes, special effects, and cool futuristic gadgets that make your head spin, the fundamentals of a good film are simply lacking. The main problem with this movie is it's plethoric cast of superheroes. There are way too many to center on at once. As hinted earlier, the movie focuses too much on showing off each character one at a time, constantly switching the audience's support from one to another. Throughout the movie, there is a constant struggle for dominance between each avenger that involves boasting, smack talk, bouts, and interferences. Pretty soon the audience is divided up rooting for their favorite hero, and the whole idea of the main villain is dropped completely! The story is simple and clear: kill Loki. Scene after scene however, that mission is forgotten by two or more of the avengers trying to display their macho-ness to one another. Unlike many great movies, this plot line is drastically linear and bare to the bones in meaning. In the midst of the film, I thought I was watching an intense WWA match from the future. Six superheroes is just too many for one movie. The filmmakers did a good job focusing on each hero, but that is all they had time for. I can't help but think, if they only had two, maybe three main heroes, they would have had enough time to develop a more interesting and meaningful plot. Decades ago, we saw for the first time great and innovative movies like Star Wars, Terminator 1 and 2, Platoon, Alien, and (just last decade) The Dark Knight. All of these films were able to focus on several main characters, villains, and a storyline that were all intricately tied together and saturated with meaningful and thought-provoking ideas. In light of The Avengers' wide and warmly welcomed reception, it seems that the standards and expectations for ""good films"" has switched to a more dry and corny interpretation. All The Avengers truly has to offer is wild action scenes, interpersonal conflict, and imaginative applications of special effects. These assets however are known for never having the capability of elongating a films success and keeping it in the fond memories of its viewers. Movies like Star Wars, which originated in the 70's, lacked horribly in intense action, and animation, but the qualities of a good story and its creativity keeps it so popular to this day. Other examples of movies that only glimmered for their achievements in animation are ones like Avatar, which was quickly forgotten because it lacked a fundamentally solid story to remember. The Avengers is merely eye-candy that satisfies Marvel fans and audiences seeking captivating fight scenes.

2015-11-02,"When this movie first came out I was somewhat excited. I hadn't seen ratings like that very often (8.8 right off the bat), and I was fairly new to IMDb at the time too. Unfortunately, it really wasn't anything special. The plot itself is pretty lackluster. It's just an average action movie in terms of story. Sure, there's nothing really wrong with that, but nevertheless it wasn't very well-done.The characters are just the same as the plot: nothing special. Sure, we get lots of looks at how well they fight, as well as a little bit of arguing, but that's about it. The character development wasn't amazing in this movie. Sure, they had the other Marvel movies to develop the characters separately, but that's hardly an excuse not to put effort into this movie. The action, which is the only thing The Avengers contains, is all just fine. Everyone's just extremely overpowered, human or not, to an unrealistic level. Overdone fights aren't really my thing, considering how commonly we see them. Overall The Avengers is nothing special. Sure, it was risky for Joss Whedon to put all the Marvel characters into one universe, and he actually pulled it off, but giving points to this movie for that is like giving it points for it's creation. The character and plot were very average, and the action was rather un-amusing.

Even if you don't like comic book movies: See it. What I find amusing is that Ironman was never really the top billing of The Avengers. It was always Captain America... until now. Robert Downey Jr. steals every scene that his name is first on the credits. Seriously, he's that awesome. I was also surprised with Mark Ruffalo's performance as The Hulk. He was great! His scenes with Robert Downey Jr. are some of the most memorable. I also haven't seen the Thor flick but the guy who played them was really good and really seemed into character. Hawkeye was cool and Scarlett Johanssen is hot. Okay, the plot? Bad guy named Loki wants to take over the world and does a really good General Zod impression (Kneel before me!) and Avengers try to stop him. What's funny is that he looks tough in the beginning but then turns into a rag doll at the end. Just ask The Hulk. And whatever injustice the previous movies had done to The Hulk certainly makes up for it here.Just see it! It's a lot of fun and it's what summer movies are supposed to be.

2014-07-26,"It's yet another glossy Marvel fantasy which seems to divide opinion – so I think it's one of best average films I've ever seen. It's entertaining, noisy, violent, and you just know who's going to win; mind you, New York was left in ruins yet again. The Marvel plot should run that New Yorker's should just leave everything as it is to save time for the next alien foul-up. Can the producers re-use any of the cgi cartoon conflagration scenes to pad out the next movie?Bad god Loki forcibly gathers a force around him in order to take over Earth and get one over his brother the good god Thor. Meanwhile in the growing chaos Samuel L. Jackson is responsible for assembling a force of superheroes to save the planet: Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, Black Widow, Thor and eventually Hawkeye. It's a shame Capt. America didn't get his moments readjusting to life in the 21st century, I. Man's slappable whimsicality was reduced, Hulk sure had some fun in his far too brief meeting with Loki, Johansson looked just as serious and good with her kit on. Personally there could have been more room for character interpolations and plot and less building-crunching battle at the end, but I suppose that's what appeals more to the kids. But I must admit that in the thick of it I was wondering where was Popeye and could he have polished the baddies all off a little quicker than this lot. And fancy a future US government signing off the building of a mammoth flying aircraft carrier – with teleportation maybe just around the corner the whole concept of travel – and battle – will be altered. I came away almost impressed at the style over substance brazenness of the film itself but very impressed with Tom Hiddleston's smooth performance as Loki; maybe an Eton education helps perfect acting with a cold heartless demeanour.I loved the after-credit ending section tying back in to the plot, and although if stripped of the cgi it's pretty simple fare I enjoyed it. Not a bad nor a great film - even if compared to Battleship; but it's barmy and just lively and fast enough to suspend belief for two hours.

2012-05-11,"If you have been a fan of the core Marvel Studios' films since 2008's IRON MAN, where the beginnings of the ""Avengers Initiative"" were first teased and carried through into the 2010 sequel as well as THE INCREDIBLE HULK, THOR and CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER, then the AVENGERS will not disappoint. In fact, it very well might make you question why the other franchise films weren't as good as this fast- paced, funny, superhero showdown.Marvel has been very focused and dedicated with the development of its properties under the Disney banner – and they no doubt wish that the Spider-Man and X-Men franchises could return to their fold, as it was the success of these earlier films that brought Marvel Comics out of bankruptcy – and has been providing solid entertainment from its creators and stars alike; by Odin's beard, Sir Kenneth Branagh directed THOR. Enter Joss Whedon, who created a weekly TV show in BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER that was a near-perfect example of a live-action comic book, to deliver a heavily-anticipated yet so-easy-to-fail production of getting such a diverse character set in a movie that worked. And worked it did.The film gets off to a slow and even somewhat murky start as Loki, Thor's mischievous half-brother, played with a Anthony Hopkins-worthy sneer by Tom Hiddleston, appears, escapes from and is responsible for the destruction of a SHIELD HQ as well as the spiriting away of a few supporting characters including Stellan Skarsgard's Dr. Selvig, also of THOR, and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, getting the full movie treatment here, all under the semi-impotent glare of Samuel L. Jackson's one-eyed spy Nick Fury. Obiously Loki never saw Samuel L's wallet from another film.The movie picks up with the re-introduction of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow as Whedon has some fun showing what moves he could have presented in BUFFY if he had an Avengers-sized budget backing him up, but it truly gets bright when the three protagonists, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, finally appear and, of course, get into a wrestling match to prove who has the biggest repulsor/shield/hammer. Once the team finally assembles, insanity, and the hilarity that often follows, ensues. Oh, and Mark Ruffalo proves that the Hulk can indeed smash.Joss Whedon's adept skills, he also writes the screenplay, prove to be the other superhero powerhouse as he successfully created a production that pleases the hardcore fanboy who is aware of Thanos, the mainstream movie audience who thinks that Tony and Pepper are destined for each other, and his own loyal, core fan base of Browncoats. Each hero gets their own time to shine in situations worthy of a comicbook splash page. The rough-up dust-up of a third act that entirely deals with the assembled team involved in a street-level brawl in NYC against, what else, an invading alien army, could very well have became tedious, as admittedly, the obligatory interstellar menace is faceless, forgettable and seemingly invented for the sales of action figures, but the action, humor and allure of these powerful heroes is truly something unique and that magic is perfectly captured on the screen.2008 saw the release of both IRON MAN and Warner Bros.'

2012-05-06,"Simple-minded live-action comic book extravaganza uniting Earth's resident superheroes to thwart Thor's adoptive brother Loki and his faceless army from destroying the world. The 3D effects aren't terribly good, though the film looks expensive and is top-heavy with crushing destruction (taking place in Manhattan, somewhat disconcerting in the post-9/11 years), coupled with blisteringly loud sound effects. Robert Downey Jr. brings his usual panache to the fore as Tony Stark/Iron Man, and Chris Evans is a wonderfully well-scrubbed Captain America, but others in the all-star cast (particularly Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson, Mark Ruffalo and, in a cameo, Gwyneth Paltrow) just appear to be slumming. The script (by Joss Whedon, who also directed) could only be amazing and complex to comic book fans who haven't been comic book fans for very long.

2012-12-19,"The Avengers was the first movie I saw in theaters three times, and for darn good reason. It sets the bar so high for comic book movies. DC is (was) seriously in a lot of trouble after The Avengers came out. If you have seen each of our hero's individual films, you will easily enjoy The Avengers ten times more. You will be also ten times more excited to see everything played out. I also feel like I need to say that I was very, very nervous when I heard The Avengers was announced. In film, we like to focus on one character, and we like to see that one person change over the course of the movie. It's hard to keep track of multiple characters, which is why the single-hero format works so well. Otherwise we end up with meathead city, like The Expendables. Gross. Luckily, we have The Avengers instead.So our unlikely heroes team up together to defeat Thor's brother, Loki. Luckily, all of these overpowered world savers are used to having each other as company, PSYCHNOTREALLY. They all have pretty big egos, let's be honest, but we don't see just how big their egos are until they all share one movie together. Jump ahead, they have to learn how to cope with one another, and just barely tolerate each other in order to stop the world-destroying threat.There is some absolutely wonderful cinematography, put together by Seamus McGarvey. Did I mention how clever the script is? Joss Whedon poured his fricking essence into the pages of writing, and it pays off so very nicely. I don't feel like The Avengers was missing anything that ticked me off. I also have never been so excited for a sequel before in my life.

But, if you have watched every previous movie, if you like the characters, then prepare yourself, because Joss Whedon has put together one of the best movies ever made by man!!thats the thing about this movie, its not really a movie on its own, i mean, it expects you to know the characters, and thats just what it has to be. This is not really a movie but a cinematic experience. If the other marvel movies are as getting to know somebody, flirting with that somebody, foreplay, the avengers is sex. Thats the best way i can put it.You can really fell that Whedon knows and loves this characters, because he takes the core elements of each of the avengers personalities and uses them for building the problems, the humor, the companionship. I have to say this is the best team assembly i have seen. This movie has the best humor, the best action, the best acting, the best characterization, the best everything.For the first time, i felt a nerdgasm, I'm not lying or exaggerating, i felt it.Any person who criticizes this movie did not get it at all, did not get the point of it, because the avengers will change cinema forever, i mean it.I love good movies, i do, i know a lot of movies and I'm not a person that watches only Hollywood movies, but i can say this.

2012-05-07,"I should start this review by saying that I am a massive comic book fan and have been for as long as I can remember. Whenever a new comic book movie comes out I get very excited and am either satisfied, more than satisfied, disappointed or mildly annoyed when I actually see the damn thing. The Marvel Cinematic Universe (Earth-199999) has been building steadily since ""Iron Man"" (more than satisfied) and has been coming along nicely brick by brick with ""The Incredible Hulk"" (yet to see), ""Iron Man 2"" (satisfied), ""Thor"" (satisfied), ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" (more than satisfied) adding more and more detail and continuity to the mountain. We have now reached ""The Avengers"" (more than satisfied) which climbs to the peak of the mountain to take it's place as the epitome of an awesome movie. I went into ""The Avengers"" excited, disbelieving that this was actually happening and very, very scared about how much I would enjoy it due to the MASSIVE hype surrounding the film. I came out in a state of great pleasure and I thank the stars that Marvel Studios chose cult television genius Joss Whedon to direct and write it. Why did I love this movie so much? 1. Joss Whedon brought the spirit, skill, humour and knowledge that this film needed. His previous works that I have seen, ""Dr. Horrible's Sing- A-Long Blog"" and ""Firefly"" prove that he can create great drama and many memorable lines both meaningful and hilarious. His twenty-five issue run on ""Astonishing X-Men"" proves that he knows Marvel characters very well and can write great superheroes with very human flaws. 2. The actors were downright perfect for their roles and each one got an equal role to play. Robert Downey Jr.(Iron Man/Tony Stark),Chris Evans(Captain America/Steve Rogers), Chris Hemsworth (Thor, God of Thunder) and Samuel L. Jackson (Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.) have already proved in previous films that they are great choices for Marvel's movies. Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow/Natasha Romanov) got just enough screen time in ""Iron Man 2"" to show she was a GOOD choice for the character, but in this she proves to be the best we could possibly ask for. Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye/Clint Barton) appeared for five seconds in ""Thor"" to shoot an arrow or two so he obviously proved nothing in that movie, but in this one he proves to be a superb choice for one of my long-time favourite Marvel characters. Mark Ruffalo (The Hulk/Bruce Banner) is the only main newcomer in this film due to Edward Norton and Marvel disagreeing with each other after ""The Incredible Hulk"" and proves to be a perfect choice for Bruce Banner, certainly better than Eric Bana in the horrible outing ""The Hulk"". Tom Hiddleston (Loki, God of Mischief) proved excellent in ""Thor"" and continues his excellence in this. Clark Gregg (Agent Phil Coulson) plays the only character created specifically for these films and has become a fan favourite through his brief appearances in previous Marvel pictures. Agent Coulson really gets his chance to shine in this film and shine he does. 3. It set things up very nicely for future entries in the series.4. The character interactions were incredible and all of the heroes and villains were smartly developed, something you can be guaranteed in a Joss Whedon production. 5. It looked great, the costumes, the fight scenes e.t.c were all very well designed. 6. It had heart, something you don't get in most blockbusters. 7. Stan Lee's cameo. 8. Post credits sequence. 9.

2012-05-14,"In the days leading up to The Avengers release I was so excited that I could barely contain myself. My girlfriend warned me not to get too excited or I would be left disappointed from my own high expectations of it. It was good advice but I simply couldn't help myself. Going into the cinema my expectations were as high as they had ever been for a movie, and yet still I was blown away. From start to finish I was rooted to my seat, with my eyes fixed to the screen. With fantastic visuals, incredible fight scenes and even some witty humor thrown in (some may think this weird but it fits in beautifully). The plot itself is not complex but is interesting and does ""The Avengers"" name justice.Still I think what made this movie so great is the movies that came before it. As soon as the movie starts you already have these characters you know, deep characters each with their own story-line.

2012-05-20,"First of all....WOW! I saw it in IMAX 3D and it was just amazing. The story, the acting, the tension, the character relationships, comic relief. Flawless. Just a work of art. I personally think that all of the Marvel movies in the last decade have been great. Movies directed by true comic fans. All leading up to this one moment in cinema history. And they did not let us down:) It's so ironic that most of the ""modern"" action movies are so far fetched. Fake. Pop hype served with sex and a big dose of ""let's come up with a really crazy story to top last years block-buster"". It get's old. This movie, somehow, has a sense of honesty and realism. No doubt, ""super-hero"" magic.

2012-04-27,"The anticipation for this film has been building up so many months since the showing of the solo movies about each of the heroes that comprise this superstar group -- Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, and finally, Captain America. These individual films were all very good on their own, so very expectations are foisted on this special film that would unite all of them in one big adventure. Even though I am out of town now, that did not stop me from catching this film with some Marvel comics geeks. And for once, a film has come that fulfills it's advanced hype, and then some!The film follows how these heroes were called together and assembled by Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. to retrieve a blue high-energy cube called the Tesseract stolen by the Asgard god Loki. It was fun how the film depicted the clash of their individual big egos of the heroes, and they did not really get along with each other right away, as would be expected. There is humor along with the high-intensity action. I felt though that some ""funny"" scenes involving Tony Stark were too self- indulgent for comfort in a ""team"" film like this.It was great to see all of these heroes get their fair share of screen time, even the lesser known ones, like the super-archer Hawkeye (the very busy Jeremy Renner) and the amazing fighter Black Widow (stunningly portrayed by the beautiful Scarlett Johansson). The others played their characters as they did in their solo movies, and amazingly, they all worked so well together here: the imperious Thor by Chris Hemsworth, the patriotic Captain America by Chris Evans and the haughty Tony Stark / Iron Man by Robert Downey Jr. People doubted if Marc Ruffalo could take Ed Norton's place as Dr. Bruce Banner and the Hulk, but Ruffalo actually imbued this character with a unique charm previously unseen in other incarnations. The Hulk received the loudest cheers from the crowd! Even the ever-loyal Agent Coulsen (Clark Gregg) gets his moment to shine.This film is a definite must-see not only for all fans of Marvel comics, but for fans of action/fantasy films in general. This is real triumph for director Josh Whedon.  Don't miss the extra scene included in the middle of the final credits for it will surely get you excited.",9.0,2012-04,Friday,"about:0.03, action:0.05, actually:0.05, agent:0.07, all:0.11, along:0.12, am:0.05, amazing:0.04, america:0.06, and:0.15, are:0.03, as:0.07, away:0.06, banner:0.05, be:0.03, been:0.04, big:0.08, black:0.04, bruce:0.05, but:0.04, by:0.19, captain:0.07, character:0.03, characters:0.03, chris:0.09, come:0.04, comics:0.10, could:0.04, credits:0.06, did:0.12, director:0.05, don:0.04, downey:0.04, each:0.08, evans:0.05, even:0.11, ever:0.04, expectations:0.06, expected:0.06, fans:0.10, felt:0.05, film:0.22, films:0.08, final:0.06, finally:0.05, for:0.15, from:0.06, fun:0.04, funny:0.05, fury:0.04, get:0.11, gets:0.05, god:0.05, good:0.03, great:0.03, group:0.06, has:0.06, hawkeye:0.04, hemsworth:0.05, here:0.05, heroes:0.15, high:0.10, his:0.03, how:0.08, hulk:0.08, humor:0.05, hype:0.06, if:0.03, in:0.12, individual:0.13, iron:0.06, is:0.06, it:0.07, jeremy:0.05, johansson:0.05, jr:0.04, like:0.06, loki:0.03, man:0.06, many:0.04, marvel:0.06, me:0.03, moment:0.06, movies:0.06, must:0.05, nick:0.04, norton:0.06, not:0.07, now:0.04, of:0.21, on:0.05, once:0.05, one:0.02, only:0.04, other:0.07, others:0.06, out:0.03, own:0.05, people:0.04, place:0.06, played:0.06, real:0.05, really:0.03, renner:0.05, right:0.05, robert:0.04, ruffalo:0.08, scarlett:0.05, scene:0.05, scenes:0.04, screen:0.04, see:0.06, since:0.05, so:0.08, some:0.10, special:0.04, stark:0.09, stop:0.06, super:0.04, take:0.05, team:0.04, tesseract:0.06, that:0.10, the:0.46, their:0.16, them:0.03, then:0.04, there:0.03, these:0.12, they:0.09, this:0.15, thor:0.06, though:0.10, time:0.03, to:0.05, together:0.07, tony:0.10, too:0.04, up:0.03, very:0.10, was:0.05, well:0.03, were:0.10, whedon:0.04, widow:0.04, will:0.03, with:0.09, would:0.07, you:0.03"

2012-05-21,"Okay, I'm expecting a full-packed action film but instead I get a more drama than action film. I'm not saying it's bad, it's just not as I expected in an 'ultimate' superheroes movie. Ultimate as more superheroes = more awesomeness.However, most of this film is more about battle of ego than saving the world, actually their ego are the real threats to this world. Except Hulk which seems there purely for action, the others need some push and a good person must die, like saving the world is not enough cause and a retaliation/revenge gives better reason. So some reel time is waste for this 'superhero drama' instead for action. I kind of disappointed with these 'selfish' superheroes. Luckily, Hulk gives several comic relief and save the movie.The action is slowly build up towards the end (too slow for me) but it pays off in the final battle. Not as spectacular as I expected but in the end it provides just enough reason why there must be a team like Avengers in this Marvel Universe. The thing that disturbed me the most is those Americans, those people who happen to be in the wrong time at the wrong place - well, not only in this film but also others like the Transformers series, etc. The city streets has become the battle ground and those mortal, ordinary people still there in the streets, watching very closely like it's just a parade or a flash mob and deliberately provide themselves as collateral damages. What's wrong with these people? Is every Americans so stupid or have suicidal tendencies? Audience can except the collateral damages, the panicked citizens, people runs for their life in the 1st 3 minutes of the battle, but after that the filmmaker should simply have a scene of these people watching from afar, behind road blocks with police guard, peeking from a secure hide-out etc.The execution is good but the script could be improved. We already know they are superheroes and there are already prequels for each character so instead of taking lots of time talking out of their differences, let these characters solve their differences in battle over battle before the final one. Lots of battle, lots of action's awesomeness. Therefore, my grin could last for days. They also failed to explain why Hulk can transform from an uncontrollable destroyer into a cooperative teammate in no time which feels like I miss some important scenes.The use of CGI - after several 'heavy CGI' films - is starting to become dull.

2012-06-17,"So here it is. After nearly fifty years, The Avengers have finally made the transition from page to screen, and best of all, it does not manage to disappoint. Much of this is down to Joss Whedon and the pitch-perfect casting.At first, the choice of Whedon as director surprised me somewhat. I really like Whedon, don't get me wrong, but with a background in television and his most notable cinematic efforts being the screenplay for the first 'Toy Story' and the unfortunately overlooked 'Serenity', he struck me as an odd choice. But make no mistake, that even with millions more dollars at hand, Whedon fortunately remains true to himself; keeping humour in sight, with plenty of instantly quotable quips and wisecracks throughout. He is confident and assured with these treasured characters, managing to juggle all these superheroes (and one super ego).We're all used to (most of ) the cast members by now; Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Chris Evans as Captain America, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson, Tom Hiddleston as Loki; but we also have some new players in the form of Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Mark Ruffalo as Hulk. What is most brilliant is that all the actors impress. I was eagerly anticipating seeing Evans as Rogers again, after falling in love with his solo effort, but it was in fact Ruffalo who struck me the most. His portrayal as the tortured Bruce Banner was nuanced, believable and very human, applying emotion to a difficult role. Hiddleston was true pleasure as the villainous Loki, giving a fantastic performance and wonderfully delivering many great lines.One quibble I had was Hawkeye's lack of screen-time, but that can be ignored as I suspect he will either get a spin-off or have a larger role in the sequel. This is the very opposite to say Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy; instead of being dark, realistic and multi-layered, this is the very synthesis of a big, bright summer movie, a blast from start to finish with humour and large action sequences. While Loki's army were a bit too Transformers-esque for my liking, I still thoroughly enjoyed the film, and exited the cinema with a satisfied smile on my face. Overall, an excellent blockbuster which deserves the praise it's getting.

Unfortunately i read Reviews and got misled by this high rating on IMDb. I expected much but i got an average action movie. The movie was not entertaining by profoundness. It was an 2 1/2 hour orgy of visual fireworks. This may be awesome for under aged persons but this definitely is not satisfying an audience that wants a story, good character description and most important a movie which is not completely foreseeable.IMDb should consider that their rating system lacks crucial information about the age of the Reviewers.

2012-05-16,"How I would love to have championed Joss Whedon for this. But alas, no.The Avengers is not a great movie. Avengers is a boring movie.OK, I saw it in 3D. The only other film I've seen in 3D was Avatar and - this may also indicate to you I'm not a movie snoot - I rather thought Avatar was OK, unlike many who say it's awful. You would be right therefore, to infer that the novelty of 3D hasn't exactly had a chance to wear thin on me yet.Let's just get the 3D out of the way: for me, it was like watching a holographic projection, very unreal. Often there were only 2, maybe just 3 planes of focus and sometimes this made the focus too oddly focused!, e.g. a wobbling briefcase in the foreground that looked like something out of Toy Story. Also, some of the action with Johanssen is frantic CGI cartoony acrobatics, and in 3D this just looks even more of a mess, anything but exciting! I was cautioned not to see in 3D - that person was right. The print isn't compensated for by the darkening effect of the glasses. I think it affected me too. Eye-fatigue, plus the combination of how those glasses make the film so dark, plus a major major flaw in the film, caused me to give up on consciousness and spare my eyeballs more than once.Yes, in 3D at least, this film is too dark to see what's going on. Detail becomes elusive and the 3D focus only allows you to see one or two parts of the screen - everything else is often deliberately way out-of-focus. This makes the film visually uninteresting (especially for us 'autistic' background viewers ;-).And the major major flaw.. Oh, I might have already let that slip: this movie is boring! Surely I can't be so bored that easily by a film I've never seen before! It's impossible! Avengers: yes, there's some showy effects that may impress those that can get off on over 2 hours of blam blam blam but me: yaaaawwn! Honestly, I was expecting to enjoy The Avengers, especially since I kinda liked the Thor movie (nothing to do with Portman, who does very little for me). And also, my total non-appreciation for The Avengers goes against what I'd hoped... that I could say something great about this film, and be able to champion Joss Whedon for a new era of Sci-Fi movies. Serenity was good, very good - albeit with forgivably TV-movie quality. Unfortunately, it seems, budget wasn't the limiting factor and I've now lost interest.Duncan Jones, do you hear?",1.0,2012-05,Wednesday,"3d:0.40, able:0.06, about:0.03, action:0.02, against:0.05, already:0.05, also:0.10, and:0.14, anything:0.05, at:0.03, avengers:0.11, be:0.07, before:0.04, boring:0.11, but:0.06, by:0.06, can:0.06, cgi:0.05, could:0.04, dark:0.10, do:0.07, does:0.04, effects:0.04, else:0.06, enjoy:0.05, especially:0.09, even:0.03, everything:0.04, exciting:0.06, film:0.18, for:0.14, get:0.07, give:0.04, goes:0.06, going:0.04, good:0.05, great:0.06, had:0.03, have:0.05, hours:0.06, how:0.07, in:0.13, is:0.10, isn:0.05, it:0.10, joss:0.07, just:0.08, least:0.05, let:0.10, like:0.05, liked:0.06, little:0.04, looks:0.06, love:0.04, made:0.04, make:0.04, makes:0.04, many:0.04, may:0.10, maybe:0.05, me:0.19, might:0.06, more:0.06, movie:0.11, movies:0.03, my:0.06, never:0.04, new:0.04, no:0.03, not:0.07, nothing:0.05, now:0.04, of:0.20, off:0.04, on:0.10, once:0.05, one:0.02, only:0.10, or:0.03, other:0.03, out:0.09, over:0.04, parts:0.06, rather:0.06, right:0.09, saw:0.05, say:0.08, screen:0.04, see:0.09, seems:0.05, seen:0.07, since:0.05, so:0.05, some:0.06, something:0.09, story:0.03, than:0.03, that:0.15, the:0.34, there:0.06, think:0.04, this:0.14, thor:0.03, those:0.09, thought:0.05, to:0.18, too:0.11, two:0.05, up:0.03, us:0.05, ve:0.13, very:0.10, was:0.15, wasn:0.05, watching:0.04, way:0.07, were:0.03, what:0.06, whedon:0.07, who:0.06, with:0.06, would:0.06, yes:0.11, yet:0.05, you:0.10"

2012-09-20,"There are several reasons why this film fails as something a person should ever watch more than once. Firstly, there is a major lack of plot twists or changes to the story that might keep you on the edge of your seat; everything about the plot is insultingly linear and predictable and follows the most basic structure of 'goods versus evil' with a predictable injection of basic virtue and morals - in this case 'unity' and 'teamwork.' are clearly highlighted.Secondly, the film manages to insult your most basic intelligence by showcasing unnecessary antics that are nothing more than fantastical nonsense. Think of an action scene and describe it in words; this is a way to bypass the lush graphics and realize that: a) while Iron Man is in space and is flying away from the portal, he somehow changes direction in the vacuum of space and returns through the portal. The Hulk, who cannot fly, jumps a few hundred feet in the air and catches Iron Man before bouncing off to safety. b) Nick Fury is violently gunned down, dusts himself down in time to evacuate the base. c) Captain America is shot down, dusts himself down and carries on. d) Black Widow, who also is incapable of flight, gives Captain America psychic eyeballing to communicate she wants to jump ten times her height into the air by bouncing off your shield so I can hijack a space-orcs flying motorcycle which is speeding towards us from a distance.One could argue that it is not meant to be realistic and is mere entertainment. What becomes salient about Avengers Assemble is that there are no rules. The heroes never get stuck, never get challenged, they're never in any recognizable danger, there are no puzzles, any challenge is overcome easily and characters do as they please. No rules means no mystery, no interest and nothing to keep you on the edge of your seat.Finally, the antagonist was hardly foreboding to ever present a sense of danger or worry against so many heroes, all equal protagonists, all dreadfully dull - especially Bruce Banner.",8.0,2012-09,Thursday,"about:0.08, action:0.03, against:0.07, all:0.05, also:0.04, america:0.08, an:0.04, and:0.27, any:0.10, are:0.16, as:0.06, assemble:0.07, avengers:0.03, away:0.07, banner:0.06, be:0.03, before:0.06, black:0.05, bruce:0.06, by:0.08, can:0.04, captain:0.08, characters:0.04, could:0.05, do:0.05, down:0.25, entertainment:0.08, especially:0.06, ever:0.10, everything:0.06, evil:0.07, few:0.06, film:0.07, finally:0.07, from:0.07, fury:0.05, get:0.09, he:0.04, her:0.07, heroes:0.09, hulk:0.03, in:0.17, into:0.05, iron:0.07, is:0.29, it:0.04, keep:0.14, man:0.07, many:0.05, might:0.07, more:0.08, most:0.09, never:0.16, nick:0.06, no:0.22, not:0.03, nothing:0.12, of:0.19, off:0.11, on:0.10, once:0.07, one:0.03, or:0.08, plot:0.10, re:0.06, scene:0.06, sense:0.07, she:0.07, should:0.06, so:0.07, something:0.06, story:0.04, than:0.09, that:0.13, the:0.32, there:0.15, they:0.07, think:0.05, this:0.07, through:0.06, time:0.04, times:0.06, to:0.22, us:0.07, wants:0.08, was:0.03, watch:0.04, way:0.05, what:0.04, which:0.04, while:0.06, who:0.08, why:0.06, widow:0.05, with:0.03, you:0.06, your:0.22"
2012-06-10,"Now I'm always getting a ton of hate for my opinion on The Avengers, so I'm prepared for many people to disagree with me. To start off, I am a huge Marvel fan, have been since I was young, so I'm not someone going in without a clue.Avengers is a solid superhero movie, with superb acting from much of the cast (it's fairly unanimous Ruffalo and Downey Jr. stole the show), great visuals, and terrific action choreography. But I still believe it to be overrated, and that is when people jump out at me. I'm not saying it's a bad film, I definitely enjoyed the viewing, especially in theatre. I couldn't really see myself caring to see it again though, not to say I would never; I just don't have a strong urge to. I am still excited for the sequel, there's no doubt about that, it will most likely be more of the same, and enjoyable. The thing about Avengers, and all of the other Marvel Studios productions (Thor, Captain America, Iron Man series) is that I don't feel they do what Christopher Nolan's Batman series has accomplished - and that is transcend the superhero genre. There is so much emotion and depth to both Batman Begins and even more so The Dark Knight, that Avengers could not even hold a candle to them. I suppose you could argue that would be due to the fact that the source material might be better for the Batman films, but I still feel the overall atmosphere of the Marvel Studios movies are less character development, more poppy in your face action sequences and quirky one liners. Again, that is not to say that is a terrible thing, it just doesn't bring Avengers, or any of the others up past 'good' for me, they do not reach great. Some people argue that the character development is great, and although I will agree that it's much better in The Avengers than any of the other Marvel films - because it had to be - it still doesn't reach compelling to me, just entertaining.",7.0,2012-06,Sunday,"about:0.07, acting:0.05, action:0.06, again:0.10, all:0.02, although:0.06, always:0.06, am:0.11, america:0.03, and:0.18, any:0.09, are:0.03, at:0.03, avengers:0.16, bad:0.05, batman:0.20, be:0.14, because:0.04, been:0.04, believe:0.06, better:0.09, both:0.06, bring:0.07, but:0.05, captain:0.04, cast:0.05, character:0.07, could:0.09, couldn:0.07, dark:0.06, definitely:0.06, depth:0.07, development:0.12, do:0.09, doesn:0.11, don:0.08, downey:0.04, enjoyed:0.06, entertaining:0.05, especially:0.05, even:0.08, face:0.07, fact:0.06, fan:0.05, feel:0.10, film:0.03, films:0.09, for:0.12, from:0.03, genre:0.07, getting:0.07, going:0.05, good:0.03, great:0.10, had:0.04, has:0.03, have:0.05, huge:0.06, in:0.08, iron:0.03, is:0.16, it:0.18, jr:0.04, just:0.09, knight:0.06, less:0.06, man:0.03, many:0.04, marvel:0.13, me:0.15, might:0.06, more:0.10, most:0.04, movie:0.02, movies:0.03, much:0.11, my:0.03, never:0.05, no:0.04, not:0.16, now:0.05, of:0.13, off:0.05, on:0.03, one:0.03, opinion:0.07, or:0.03, other:0.07, others:0.06, out:0.03, overall:0.06, past:0.07, people:0.14, really:0.04, ruffalo:0.04, same:0.05, say:0.09, see:0.07, sequel:0.07, sequences:0.06, series:0.13, show:0.06, since:0.05, so:0.12, some:0.03, start:0.06, still:0.19, superhero:0.08, than:0.04, that:0.25, the:0.34, them:0.04, there:0.06, they:0.06, thing:0.10, thor:0.03, though:0.05, to:0.23, up:0.03, was:0.02, what:0.03, when:0.04, will:0.07, with:0.05, without:0.05, would:0.07, you:0.03, your:0.05"

2012-06-07,"Here's a simple, fun, well-made summer movie. It's not great by any measure, nor does it ever try to be. What it does have is a director who understands that the source material is essentially comic book fluff. None of these characters have the depth that Batman or the X-Men do, but they do have cool powers and cool personalities that make for a decent story and some great action set pieces.The most epic of these sequences takes place in – you'll never guess, never, not in a milllion years – New York City! While the scene lacks originality in location, it does make up for it in sheer excitement. Iron Man goes rocketing around town in spectacular aerial battles with the Chitauri, who are as disposable as the Foot Soldiers from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Hawkeye sits on a perch on top of a building and casually snipes more Chitauri out of the air with his bow and arrow. The Hulk, well, he smashes. His chaotic leaping and random crushing of the puny aliens is spectacular to watch.

2013-01-30,"Anyone gave 5 to 10 stars for this absurdity who is past 18th birthday , not a comic book publisher Marvel Fanboy and does have a girlfriend please raise your hand.No one ? Thought so. The movie is atrocious. There is a plot a plus compared Transformers movies but it is so simplistic and full of tropes , deux-ex-machinas ( I lost count how many times Loki's magic staff was used to explain everything and advance story from brain washing to destroy portal opening device ) , stereotypes , predictability and cheap juvenile PG-13 jokes it becomes a parody. I wonder that was the intention. Self mocking with movie concept , characters , genre etc. Because there is no way this movie goes unpredictable or might surprise you. Ending credits might have said ""From producers of Scary Movie"" or ""Meet the Spartans"" Final CGI explosion filled fight scene (another parallel to Transformers movies ) against alien invaders where no one was harmed due to rating was so messy with headache inducing 3D scenery you either had to get out of theater for fresh air or close your eyes and ears ( I did former ) The result is box office inflated animation due to marketing hype. Except CGI special effects overuse it has little cinematic quality. Actors try to make something out of their characters but child like character material gives them little chance on that.Comic book fan boys.

2012-04-29,"The Avengers is what we all dream about on reading those superhero comics and watching the movies. We always would love the concept of having all superheroes assembled and fighting for justice and that if such a thing happens, nothing ever could happen to our planet Earth. However, rational thinking would suggest putting them all in one basket would make movie making quite difficult since the logistics of bringing an all conquering villain along with the bonding of the superheroes would change the dynamic of the superhero movie concept and can be a double edged sword if not handled properly. Certainly they cannot make a movie where the heroes are summoned to fight evil and they come and finish the job and they leave. It has to be more complicated than that for the movie to succeed and it is.Hats off to the director and writers of this movie since they not only have a villain who is manipulative, evil and quite powerful with his own army who can provide quite a challenge to the heroes but also have handled well the tricky scenarios of putting all the heroes in the same room. Hulk, Iron Man and Thor are all used to fighting outside of the law as vigilantes in their own movies. These three would normally have no problem working together. The bonding between Ironman and Hulk was depicted aptly since they are both scientists and vigilantes. However, the presence of Captain America, black widow and hawk-eye, who are all used to following orders and work for the law, within this mix creates a lot of tension in the air when they start interacting. The blame games and one-liners are ON and believe me, the one liners from RDJ are really cracking. All this makes for a compelling first half.Obviously, the second half is all about how they work together to destroy the enemy. Its predictable, but its fun and visually awesome as well. Visually its a spectacle and must be watched in 3D. The movie is not without its cons though. For one, I really thought, with Loki as the villain, Thor should have had a better role to play. Unfortunately he was severely under utilized. Scarlett is given an expansive role (I should say her body in that tight fighting outfit is awesome. She is hot) which sometimes even outshines Captain America and the rest.Watch it.

2012-09-11,"Based on the hype, I expected The Avengers to be one of those classic comic book movies that leave you breathless and amazed. Helmed by Joss Whedon, lead up to by several other comic book movies, I really thought this would be amazing.But it's not amazing, it's good. It's about Iron Man good, which puts it a notch above Thor, a notch below Captain America, and several notches above Iron Man II and the Incredible Hulk.There's just not a lot to it. Captain America was a good movie because it delved into the character, but here the movie rarely goes deeper than the occasional witticism. The only character theme is some squabbling, but this comes across as kids on a playground (although it is entertaining to see the movie play the ""what superhero could beat what superhero game""), and resolves itself perfunctorily. This is not what I expect from Joss Whedon; it's what I would have expected from Whedon directly after he made the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie.This is not to say that the movie is not enjoyable. It does have some cool special effects here and there and it moves along at a quick pace. The performances are generally good; I particularly liked Mark Ruffalo's laid-back Hulk. It's got some very cute moments sprinkled in, although they feel a little lost among the endless battles.It's a good movie, and if you want a fun popcorn flick this would be a good choice, but it's not a classic.",7.0,2012-09,Tuesday,"about:0.05, after:0.06, along:0.08, although:0.16, amazing:0.12, america:0.09, and:0.17, are:0.04, as:0.03, at:0.04, avengers:0.03, back:0.07, be:0.11, because:0.05, book:0.13, but:0.12, by:0.09, captain:0.09, character:0.10, comes:0.08, comic:0.11, cool:0.08, could:0.06, does:0.06, effects:0.05, entertaining:0.07, expect:0.08, expected:0.17, feel:0.07, from:0.08, fun:0.06, goes:0.09, good:0.25, got:0.07, have:0.07, he:0.05, here:0.13, hulk:0.08, hype:0.08, if:0.05, in:0.03, incredible:0.07, into:0.05, iron:0.09, is:0.13, it:0.34, itself:0.09, joss:0.11, just:0.04, liked:0.08, little:0.07, lot:0.06, made:0.05, man:0.08, mark:0.06, moments:0.07, movie:0.17, movies:0.09, not:0.21, of:0.02, on:0.08, one:0.04, only:0.05, original:0.09, other:0.05, performances:0.09, play:0.09, really:0.05, ruffalo:0.06, say:0.06, see:0.04, some:0.14, special:0.06, superhero:0.10, than:0.05, that:0.06, the:0.33, there:0.08, they:0.04, this:0.13, thor:0.04, those:0.07, thought:0.07, to:0.13, up:0.05, very:0.05, want:0.07, was:0.03, what:0.18, whedon:0.16, which:0.05, would:0.15, you:0.07"
2012-04-29,"Marvel studios took a leap of faith in handing this project to the brilliant Joss Whedon. After all, his only other film that got a cinema release (Serenity) failed to even recoup its budget at the box office. They must have seen something in him, though, because this film is, in every sense of the word, Epic!It could so easily have just been Iron Man And His Sidekicks, but Whedon's fine grasp of characters gives everyone involved their fair share of screen time without the film dragging for a second. Tony Stark / Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) is all cock-sure and swagger. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is every inch the demi-god that has Earth ""under his protection"". Steve Rogers / Captain America (Chris Evans) is a man so far out of his own time he feels alien to the world he now lives in. Most enigmatic of the group is Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow (Scarlett Johansen), who is a master manipulator and reveals only as much as she wants you to know, and Cliff Barton / Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) who is both mentor and partner to her. Their history is one that needs its own film!The real joy of the piece, though, is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / The Hulk. Banner lives an isolated life, barely keeping ""the other guy"" in check, when Nick Fury sends Black Widow to recruit him. In a nice twist, it is Banner who is needed, not Hulk. Ruffalo is, by far and with all due respect to Eric Bana and Ed Norton, the best Banner AND Hulk to date and is given 2 of the films most memorable moments.Tom Middleston chews up the scenery as Loki, every bit as evil as Thor is good, with a plan for each of The Avengers in turn.Samuel L Jackson is given more to do as Nick Fury than ever before. He is the master control of The Avengers Initiative, so confident in each of his heroes he is willing to defy orders from his superiors.Visually stunning with great character developments, awesome special effects and a breathtaking pace, you never feel the 2 hr 10 minute running time. Popcorn will be left behind as you laugh and cheer through this ride.With the obligatory Stan Lee Cameo (although he is not the best cameo in the film) and Joss Whedon's trademark sucker-punch both in place, Avengers Assemble (as it is known in the UK) is by far the best superhero film to date.

2012-05-06,"And so the most awaited movie of the year, the Avengers is released, and I went with the whole family to see it !! Not sure why anyone would come here and read some reviews about it, i mean let us face it, you already made your decisions to go and see it, you just want to make sure !! a hugely marketed movie like this will always attract people to go and see it, it is very hard to ignore all the big fuss and all those giant billboards and adds of it everywhere !! I went in with huge expectations, and it had to be said that the movie did not let me down,however, i believe it is way too overrated and over hyped ! the movie starts out very slowly, and for the first hour or so, i felt some boredom creeping in, or was it my exuberant mood and impatience for the action to starts ? there was just too much stretch of boring speech and slow scenes of the gathering of the Avengers in the first hour or so.I was expecting a roller coaster of action / adventure scenes from start to finish and i guess i was slammed in the face by the slow built up in the beginning. my two younger daughters "" 5 and 6 "" certainly got bored and fidgety, which added to my frustration.Having said that, the movie is a success in what its trying to do, which is gathering all those super heroes together in one film, it was entertaining and enjoyable over the whole run. I just thought that the plot was nothing special, just your average cartoonish plot of an evil villain who wants to rule the world, the serious dialog involving the main plot was boring and empty with no interest in it, however, when the funny scenes and dialog jump in, its really enjoyable and pure fun.Each of the characters had an almost equal screen time, although, the roles seems uneven with the highest importance going to Iron man, and a lot of time went into trying to explore the Black Widow and Hawkeye relationship but failing in adding any strong background about those two characters, did not feel or care much about them.the Hulk was also sort of put on the side, not clear what his involvement was into the team, supposedly he knows much about the Gama radiation, but i was puzzled with him, at times he was completely out of control and not distinguishing between the heroes and Villains, and other times, he was completely submissive to his fellow super heroes.It was clear that iron man was running the show, maybe the leader some how, which i liked since he is among my favorites, his quarrels with Captain America were fun and there seemed liked a power struggle between the two !!Thor was another character put on the side, did not have a big impact other than his brother being the villain !! Sameul L Jackson's character Nick Fury was the most annoying as the leader of the Avengers, his speeches and his overall role were useless and annoying, very frustrating and if i were a super hero, i wouldn't join a team that he leads. just an empty character.certain parts of the plot were lame and silly, like when a certain character in the movie was killed, and his death was the ultimate reason for the Avengers to finally join together was a bit too corny.Now the good parts !! because once the action starts, it really is brilliant !! some very impressive visuals and solid action scenes with the involvement of the Avengers, especially the final fight in the end, it was superb, although not entirely original "" some similarities to the last Transformers movie "", still very enjoyable and the kids certainly were impressed and glued to the big screen with excitement.So in Summary, the Avengers is not the best movie ever made, and not in anyway a masterpiece, however, it is entertaining and is original as the first film with multiple superheroes in it. the first half gets a 6.5 out of 10, but then the 2nd half of the movie gets a solid 9 !! my 8 year old son says its a 10 !! :)Moebardi.blogspot.com",7.0,2012-05,Sunday,"10:0.05, about:0.08, action:0.06, all:0.04, almost:0.03, already:0.03, also:0.02, although:0.06, always:0.03, america:0.02, an:0.05, and:0.33, another:0.03, any:0.02, anyone:0.03, as:0.03, at:0.02, avengers:0.08, be:0.01, because:0.02, beginning:0.03, being:0.02, believe:0.03, best:0.02, between:0.05, big:0.07, bit:0.03, black:0.02, boring:0.07, brilliant:0.03, brother:0.03, but:0.04, by:0.02, captain:0.02, care:0.04, certainly:0.07, character:0.08, characters:0.03, come:0.02, did:0.07, do:0.02, down:0.03, each:0.02, end:0.02, entertaining:0.05, especially:0.03, ever:0.02, evil:0.03, expectations:0.03, face:0.07, feel:0.03, felt:0.03, fight:0.03, film:0.03, final:0.03, finally:0.03, first:0.08, for:0.04, from:0.02, fun:0.05, funny:0.03, fury:0.02, gets:0.06, go:0.05, going:0.03, good:0.02, got:0.03, had:0.04, half:0.06, hard:0.03, have:0.01, having:0.03, hawkeye:0.02, he:0.09, here:0.03, hero:0.03, heroes:0.06, him:0.03, his:0.13, hour:0.07, how:0.02, however:0.09, huge:0.03, hulk:0.02, if:0.02, impressive:0.04, in:0.16, into:0.04, iron:0.03, is:0.10, it:0.17, its:0.06, jackson:0.03, just:0.08, last:0.03, let:0.06, like:0.03, liked:0.07, lot:0.02, made:0.04, main:0.03, make:0.02, man:0.03, maybe:0.03, me:0.02, most:0.04, movie:0.10, much:0.06, my:0.09, nick:0.03, no:0.02, not:0.12, nothing:0.03, now:0.02, of:0.16, old:0.03, on:0.03, once:0.03, one:0.01, or:0.07, original:0.07, other:0.04, out:0.05, over:0.05, overall:0.03, parts:0.07, people:0.02, plot:0.09, power:0.03, put:0.06, read:0.03, really:0.04, reason:0.03, reviews:0.03, role:0.03, said:0.06, scenes:0.09, screen:0.05, see:0.05, seemed:0.04, seems:0.03, serious:0.04, show:0.03, since:0.03, so:0.06, some:0.09, special:0.02, start:0.03, still:0.02, super:0.07, superheroes:0.02, sure:0.06, team:0.05, than:0.02, that:0.06, the:0.53, them:0.02, then:0.02, there:0.03, this:0.01, thor:0.02, those:0.08, thought:0.03, time:0.03, times:0.06, to:0.17, together:0.04, too:0.07, transformers:0.03, two:0.08, up:0.02, us:0.03, very:0.10, villain:0.05, want:0.03, wants:0.04, was:0.25, way:0.02, went:0.10, were:0.10, what:0.03, when:0.04, which:0.06, who:0.02, whole:0.06, why:0.03, widow:0.02, will:0.02, with:0.11, world:0.02, would:0.02, year:0.06, you:0.03, your:0.05"
2019-08-15,"First I rated this movie a 10 back in 2017 as during that time I was still brainwashed under the MCU. I thought they were prefect movies. I'll keep Avengers 1 as 10/10 instead of giving it a 6/10.
It's great for being a movie on this scale it's just not near the best movies or superhero movies in terms of story and development.Back in 2012 I was MCU hyped and practically worshiped the MCU and praised movies like Avengers 1. At the time in 2012 Avengers 1 I felt was the greatest thing ever.Now in 2019 my views on Avengers 1 and the MCU has changed completely. MCU does not deserve the hype it gets from the general audience and media.
Avengers 1 even for a first take was pretty generic where it still has unanswered plot holes.Avengers 1 is a good movie on its own comparison. Its overrated generally speaking. It has brainwashed fans/kids/fanboys (like I was). I was ignorant to the flaws and worshipped an ugly looking movie like Avengers 1. I once worshipped the MCU like a damn fool.MCU and the Avengers 1 ruins its self with lack of character/story development, under used villains, weak heroes and pointless jokes.Other than Loki, hela and Thanos all villains are jobbers. All the heroes are treated as highly durable in terms of plot device and plot armour.Recommendation: Watch this movie for fun while drinking a beer or some food with a lot of sugar otherwise you may get brainwashed like I was. In addition, if your will power is weak don't watch this movie or any MCU movie.",10.0,2019-08,Thursday,"10:0.20, 2012:0.13, all:0.05, an:0.03, and:0.20, any:0.05, are:0.06, as:0.08, at:0.03, audience:0.06, avengers:0.23, back:0.11, being:0.05, best:0.04, character:0.04, development:0.13, does:0.05, don:0.04, even:0.04, ever:0.05, fans:0.06, felt:0.06, first:0.08, for:0.08, from:0.03, fun:0.05, get:0.04, gets:0.06, giving:0.07, good:0.03, great:0.04, greatest:0.07, has:0.11, heroes:0.09, highly:0.07, hype:0.07, if:0.04, in:0.16, instead:0.07, is:0.04, it:0.13, its:0.13, just:0.03, keep:0.07, like:0.16, ll:0.06, loki:0.04, looking:0.07, lot:0.05, may:0.06, mcu:0.56, movie:0.16, movies:0.14, my:0.04, not:0.06, now:0.05, of:0.10, on:0.09, once:0.06, or:0.11, other:0.04, own:0.06, plot:0.14, power:0.07, pretty:0.06, some:0.04, still:0.10, story:0.08, superhero:0.04, take:0.06, than:0.04, that:0.02, the:0.23, they:0.03, thing:0.06, this:0.09, thought:0.06, time:0.07, to:0.02, used:0.07, was:0.19, watch:0.08, were:0.04, where:0.05, while:0.06, will:0.04, with:0.05, you:0.03, your:0.05"
2012-05-04,"RATING: See it in theaters (Rating System: ""See it in theaters,"" ""Wait for the instant download,"" ""Don't waste your time"")Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the half-brother of Thor has returned to Earth to pave the way for a wave of destruction at the hands of evil aliens. But secret agency S.H.E.I.L.D has been preparing by analyzing the mysterious Tesseract – an blue-glowing cube of unharnessed infinite power. Loki steals the Tesseract and it is up to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), leader of S.H.I.E.L.D to pull together a team of the world's first super heroes to defeat Loki and return the Tesseract from whence it came. The heroes are known as The Avengers and they are Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner).The Avengers is a recipe for disaster. It is an ensemble cast of players, each of whom is a third magnitude star in his (or her) own right. Whenever you get this many egos in the room at one time, there is bound to be in-fighting. And in fact, this is what happens in the movie. The heroes can't get along. They jockey for alpha-male status, only to find that they are equals, each with his own unique strength. And yet, both on the screen and in reality, they find a balance. Each actor brings his own ingredients to the mix. And each actor plays his (or her) character to perfection; as if it were their own film.Another problem is backstory – there is a lot of it. Some of these characters have been brought to the collective consciousness in their own debut films of the last couple of years (Iron Man, The Hulk, Thor, and Captain America). If you've seen their films then you have an idea of who they are already. The other two needed a bit more introduction and it was skillfully interlaced with the action.And then there's the problem of interaction – 6 main players plus Fury and Loki implies 28 different relationships. And that's a hard act to pull off in just 142 minutes.Still, writer/director Joss Whedon (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" ""Serenity"") pulls it all off with apparent ease. The story is relentless in its pace and still fills us in on who the characters are and what they contribute. There's an amazing scene when the characters are at their lowest point (close friends are dead, the team is dispersed) and they expose each other's weaknesses. The souls of our heroes are left bare. This gives us nowhere to go but up.And indeed, up we go. To beat their combined foe, the team must pull together: each member using their special gifts to turn back an invading force.But as amazing as the film is, there are problems. The last climactic scenes are a series of improbable battles in the heart of New York City. Mind you, these battles are carried out with much more precision than the garbage whirlwind of the Transformers films. But, due to the PG-13 nature of the film, we find little bloodshed and a lot of tumbling skyscrapers.Which brings me to the biggest problem I have with the film: just how strong are these super heroes? Hulk, besides being hulking, is apparently impervious to direct bullet and missile fire. Captain America can apparently withstand the full force of alien hand grenades. Iron Man takes a licking and keeps on ticking. And Thor, with his mighty hammer seems to be able to stop anything, but still goes flying when monsters whip their tails. And for the other two (who remind me of the Professor and Marianne from Gilligan's Island – ""and the rest""), when there is a battle they are sent off to do reconnaissance or direct traffic lest they be trampled or crushed. They may be more of a liability than they are worth.Finally, I want to talk about the unsung hero of the Marvel universe: Stan Lee. Lee has a cameo appearance in every Marvel action movie. He is held as sort of the progenitor of modern hero lore. As such, he is a special icon in the comic book (and now movie) realm. All legends spring from his fount. There is a name for that kind of hero – they are called gods.So, for outstanding story, characters, special effects and an amazing ""boot"" (not even a reboot) of a new franchise, I recommend you see it in theaters.",7.0,2012-05,Friday,"able:0.04, about:0.02, action:0.03, actor:0.07, alien:0.03, all:0.03, along:0.03, already:0.03, amazing:0.08, america:0.06, an:0.10, and:0.26, another:0.03, anything:0.03, are:0.22, as:0.08, at:0.05, avengers:0.03, back:0.03, battle:0.03, be:0.06, been:0.04, being:0.02, biggest:0.04, bit:0.03, black:0.02, book:0.03, both:0.03, brings:0.07, brother:0.03, brought:0.04, but:0.06, by:0.02, came:0.03, can:0.04, captain:0.06, cast:0.03, character:0.02, characters:0.07, chris:0.05, comic:0.02, different:0.03, director:0.03, do:0.02, don:0.02, downey:0.02, each:0.13, earth:0.03, effects:0.02, ensemble:0.04, evans:0.03, even:0.02, every:0.02, evil:0.03, fact:0.03, fighting:0.03, film:0.06, films:0.07, finally:0.03, find:0.10, first:0.02, for:0.09, franchise:0.04, from:0.05, full:0.03, fury:0.05, get:0.04, go:0.05, goes:0.04, half:0.03, hard:0.03, has:0.05, have:0.04, hawkeye:0.02, he:0.04, hemsworth:0.03, her:0.07, hero:0.08, heroes:0.11, hiddleston:0.03, his:0.12, how:0.02, hulk:0.05, idea:0.04, if:0.04, in:0.18, iron:0.05, is:0.17, it:0.11, its:0.02, jackson:0.03, jeremy:0.03, johansson:0.03, joss:0.02, jr:0.02, just:0.03, kind:0.03, last:0.06, left:0.04, little:0.03, loki:0.08, lot:0.05, main:0.03, man:0.05, many:0.02, mark:0.02, marvel:0.04, may:0.03, me:0.04, mind:0.03, minutes:0.03, more:0.05, movie:0.04, much:0.02, must:0.03, new:0.05, nick:0.03, not:0.01, now:0.03, of:0.28, off:0.08, on:0.05, one:0.01, only:0.02, or:0.07, other:0.06, our:0.03, out:0.02, own:0.14, point:0.03, power:0.03, rating:0.07, recommend:0.03, renner:0.03, rest:0.03, right:0.03, robert:0.02, ruffalo:0.02, samuel:0.03, scarlett:0.03, scene:0.03, scenes:0.02, screen:0.02, see:0.05, seems:0.03, seen:0.02, series:0.03, so:0.02, some:0.02, special:0.07, star:0.03, still:0.08, stop:0.03, story:0.04, such:0.03, super:0.05, takes:0.03, team:0.07, tesseract:0.11, than:0.04, that:0.04, the:0.45, their:0.13, then:0.05, there:0.12, these:0.07, they:0.20, this:0.03, thor:0.07, time:0.04, to:0.22, together:0.04, tom:0.03, transformers:0.04, two:0.06, universe:0.03, up:0.06, us:0.06, ve:0.03, wait:0.03, want:0.03, was:0.01, way:0.02, we:0.05, were:0.02, what:0.04, whedon:0.02, when:0.06, which:0.02, who:0.06, widow:0.02, with:0.08, world:0.03, worth:0.03, years:0.03, yet:0.03, york:0.04, you:0.07, your:0.03"

Jeremy Renner and Robert Downing Jr saved this film. Renner is a top notch action star in the making.

2012-04-26,"Hey guys. I've written a HUGE review of this. Here is the first few paragraphs. Head over to www.thecrat.com to read my full review.Disclaimer: if you're anything like me, you want to go into The Avengers as blind as possible. I will try to avoid addressing the majority of the plot, but when I have to clearly address plot points I will mark them as spoilers.2012 is gearing up to be the biggest year in film ever. With new entries into some of the most beloved franchises of all time (Lord of the Rings, Alien, James Bond and Batman) it is a good year to be a film geek. The first of the year's massive releases arrives in the form of The Avengers (sorry, Hunger Games, you have the box office, but not the scope to join the heavy hitters). The question everyone (or just geeks) is asking: is this the best comic book film ever? I would have to answer with an emphatic no. This film is big, huge in fact, and it gets a lot of things right. But I also think, considering the pedigree and lead-up to this film, The Avengers should have been a game-changer. Unfortunately, it is not.The Avengers is the culmination of the 'Marvel Studios' Cinematic Universe'. Marvel has created a series of films starring their heroes (Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and The Incredible Hulk) that all coincide in the same reality (just like the comic books). This connectivity has been planned from the start so that when Marvel was ready, they could join these characters into a single film. That moment has arrived with The Avengers. The Avengers is primarily made for fans of these films: if you have skipped the previous films and missed the back-story, you may find that your enjoyment of this new entry is limited.The plot of The Avengers sees the demigod Loki (the great, snarling Tom Hiddleston) planning to enslave the entirety of the human race. Minor spoilers: after his exile in Thor, Loki finds himself in a strange portion of the universe, one controlled by an alien race known as the Chitauri (the identity of this race is inconsequential, and it is revealed within the first few moments of The Avengers). Loki plans to use the Chitauri's numbers to achieve his goal of world domination. Once Loki makes his presence known on earth, it is up to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to unite earth's mightiest heroes into a force capable of combating Loki and the Chitauri.The man primarily responsible for this cinematic interpretation of the comic is Joss Whedon. Whedon acts as the writer and director of The Avengers and it is far and away his biggest undertaking yet. Mainly known for his television work (Buffy and Firefly), Whedon has only ever directed one other film: the low-scale (compared to The Avengers) Serenity. Marvel Studios has a reputation of hiring risky or untested (in big budget films) actors and directors to make their films (the recovering addict Robert Downey Jnr as Iron Man, the relatively unknown Chris Hemsworth as Thor) and the majority of these decisions have paid off gloriously. Unfortunately, Whedon isn't exactly one of them. Despite being an authority on geek culture, Whedon's pacing, plot and cinematic eye are good, but they still leave a lot to be desired. This is a quantum leap in terms of his career and Whedon (mostly) steps up to the plate. The Avengers would be a daunting prospect for any director, let alone one with a single film under their belt. Whedon is largely regarded for his writing and in The Avengers it is very much hit and miss. He nails the characters' voices and his dialogue is mostly fantastic (except for a few Downey Jnr quips – but knowing him, I'd imagine they are improvised).However, his basic plot framework is quite muddled. A film of this calibre should function like a well-oiled machine, not feel like it is made out of spare parts.

2018-03-23,"""The Avengers"" is the first 'team up' movie for the MCU combining Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor. Alongside with Black Widow, Hawkeye, Nick Fury, and of course, The Hulk. To fight the maniacal and oddly comical in all the best ways, Loki, Brother of Thor and part Frost Giant. And this movie is everything you could ever think you would want in a super hero collaboration film. Joss Whedon wrote and directed this film to perfection. With the team up of everyone being seamless and interesting with various conflicts throughout and the almost certain that they could never work together ever until the end. Each character feels used amazingly with comedy being brought in perfectly, drama at the perfect times, and a whole hell of a lot of action in this 143 minute film. With expanding on a lot of the small quirks of each character and the nail biting tension throughout the film done by the fantastic direction and great feel of this film. Joss Whedon put in all he could ever do in this film and executed it perfectly. The writing by Whedon is also flawless. When I first saw this film in 2012, I honestly thought these actors were real with how fluent and smooth their dialogue was combined with the A+ acting done too by each and every cast member, even the 'one scene' actors shown throughout. Not a single actor had any opinion in the writing of the film and with solely Whedon writing it, you can see how well of a writer he is and how smooth he can make the conversations in this film. Especially my favorite parts of the dialogue are the small on going jokes throughout the film with each character, it brings the light out of some of the darkest scenes and can make each and everyone as memorable as possible. I remember quoting this film like it was a religious text or something with how well written it is. The acting is once again perfect. Robert Downey Jr. plays once again a flawless Tony Stark with either his smooth and slick execution of every line, to him hiding snacks throughout the sets to add to his quirky character that the audience has grown to love and appreciate in the film. New Comer Mark Ruffalo in the MCU also kills it as Bruce Banner/Hulk with his uneasy performance and social awkwardness too. Everyone else, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson also do amazingly with their roles with a smooth balance of comedy and seriousness in each of their scenes. The casting in this series is still flawless and I don't want to change a single cast member with their respective roles. The Avengers is a fantastic movie that will be put down in history as one of the best superhero movies to ever exist and should deserve its popularity and praise for its technical accomplishment and storytelling milestone.

2012-05-05,"I couldn't wait to see th Avengers. I thought that it would be on the same level as the Iron Man movies, Thor and Captain America. Sadly its more on par with the two Hulk movies instead. I have to admit that I am a fan of superheroes but I really wasn't into the Avengers as the cartoons contains too many whiny characters, well the movie is no different. There is too much preaching by Nick Fury, Captain America is too angry (angrier than the Hulk in fact), way too much Tony Stark and too much exposition about science that we really don't care about. The only characters that really shine on screen are Black Widow (wonderful kick ass fight screens, woman with power without superpowers), Hawkeye, Thor, Loki (until he starts getting boring) and Agent Colson. Joss Whedon usually knows how to temper his characters better but in this movie he really put together some awful dialog. Yes some of the jokes were funny but in between there were long periods of just boring stuff. It's too bad I know this will make a lot of money but it could have been so much better.

2015-09-14,"The Avengers is a great movie and I think it's because of what they wanted to do with this film in Phase One of Marvel's cinematic universe and this movie pays off quickly.The action is just amazing and the final fight at the end is just top-notch. You already know what the plot is about so I don't have to go over it, but I will say that the story was light hearted and dark at the same time and you had some humor. The ending fight was the longest fight scene ever shown in this film.Robert Downey Jr is great as Iron Man and he does get a lot of screen time. Chris Evans plays Captain America and he does an amazing job, Chris Hemsworth and Jeremy Renner were both good as Thor and Hawkeye and they have done a very interesting job with their characters. Mark Ruffalo was cool as Bruce Banner / The Hulk and he does motion capture for the Hulk and it was really great to see him as a superhero. Scarlett Johannson plays Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff and she could not done better in this film, but the one person who really was great is Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Thor's brother and he makes a good villain. James Spader is gonna do better as the title character, Ultron in the upcoming sequel in the 2015 Marvel Studios film, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"", which will be released this Friday on May 1st, 2015 and it is really cool to hear and see him as Ultron.Aaron Taylor-Johnson is going to rock as Quicksilver, but I think Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen's sister, Elizabeth, is hot as Scarlet Witch and she's gonna do great in that part, but Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury is good in the screen time he has in this film, but he only has a cameo or small part in the new Avengers movie, which I will review on Friday May 1st, 2015 and I think it's going to be a good film to start off the summer 2015 movie season.The visual effects are really impressive and really cool in this movie, especially The Hulk in this film. The music by Alan Silvestri is fantastic and amazing. I could not believe the music that I heard in this film and it was amazing to hear it. The film's running time feels like it's three hours long, but it is only 2 hours and 42 minutes long, so the movie moves on very quickly.Overall, I love THE AVENGERS and I am giving it an 8 / 10. Marvel has outdone themselves with this film and they will continue to outdo themselves with other future Marvel movies and it's not like every day that a four-year plan pays off with such praise and hype, but this paid off wonderfully.",9.0,2015-09,Monday,"10:0.04, about:0.03, action:0.02, already:0.04, am:0.04, amazing:0.14, america:0.03, an:0.05, and:0.37, are:0.02, as:0.20, at:0.05, avengers:0.08, banner:0.04, be:0.04, because:0.03, believe:0.05, better:0.06, black:0.03, both:0.04, brother:0.04, bruce:0.04, but:0.12, by:0.03, captain:0.03, character:0.03, characters:0.02, chris:0.07, cinematic:0.05, cool:0.14, could:0.06, dark:0.04, day:0.05, do:0.10, does:0.10, don:0.03, done:0.08, downey:0.03, effects:0.03, end:0.04, especially:0.04, evans:0.04, ever:0.03, every:0.03, fantastic:0.04, feels:0.05, fight:0.12, film:0.22, final:0.05, for:0.02, four:0.05, fury:0.04, get:0.03, giving:0.05, go:0.03, going:0.07, good:0.09, great:0.12, had:0.03, has:0.07, have:0.04, hawkeye:0.03, he:0.16, hemsworth:0.04, hiddleston:0.04, him:0.07, hours:0.10, hulk:0.07, humor:0.04, hype:0.05, impressive:0.05, in:0.19, interesting:0.05, iron:0.02, is:0.19, it:0.16, jackson:0.04, jeremy:0.04, job:0.08, jr:0.03, just:0.05, know:0.03, like:0.05, loki:0.03, long:0.08, lot:0.03, love:0.04, makes:0.04, man:0.02, mark:0.03, marvel:0.10, may:0.09, minutes:0.05, movie:0.10, movies:0.02, new:0.04, nick:0.04, not:0.06, of:0.06, off:0.14, on:0.06, one:0.04, only:0.06, or:0.03, other:0.03, over:0.03, overall:0.04, part:0.08, plot:0.03, really:0.13, renner:0.04, review:0.05, robert:0.03, ruffalo:0.03, same:0.04, samuel:0.04, say:0.03, scarlett:0.04, scene:0.04, screen:0.07, see:0.05, sequel:0.05, she:0.10, so:0.05, some:0.03, start:0.05, story:0.03, such:0.04, summer:0.05, superhero:0.03, that:0.07, the:0.33, their:0.03, they:0.07, think:0.10, this:0.17, thor:0.05, time:0.10, to:0.13, tom:0.04, top:0.04, universe:0.04, very:0.06, villain:0.04, visual:0.05, was:0.11, were:0.03, what:0.05, which:0.06, who:0.03, widow:0.03, will:0.11, with:0.09, year:0.04, you:0.04"

It's just one of those action-packed, no-intellect-required movies. For this to be #34 in the top movies of all time is shameful. I'm sure many people can think of 250 movies that're far superior to this one.The acting itself was fine, although it did seem a little awkward at times. The dialogue did get extremely cheesy, although it was good cheesy.

2012-04-24,"I deliberately avoided seeing any trailers or pictures or anything that might have reduced the impact of The Avengers, but I don't think it would have made any difference. Simply put Joss Whedon has succeeded where so many others have failed in the past, most notably DC Comics,to bring comic book characters to the real world and the big screen,without alienating the fans or confusing the newbies, and seemingly the hardest task, to make it a good movie. An indication of how he has succeeded is my poor 11 year old daughter, who gets dragged to all the Iron Man, Green Lantern, etc, movies with me and her brothers and she suffers through them quietly (mostly). However after leaving The Avengers she declared it her favourite movie ever. I can't comment on how you would enjoy this movie without the back story contained in the previous Marvel/Avengers Characters movies, but I think that pretty much everyone alive today has some knowledge of who Iron Man, The Hulk and Captain America are, you should be able to work the rest out from there. I saw it in 3D and it was good, but I wouldn't say the 3D is a must.

2012-05-07,"The movie gets high marks for not being hokey. In fact great effort was put in the movie to make it a movie. It gets a well done from me. You have to suspend any logic or common sense to be entertained. If you can, this movie will keep you occupied for over 2 hours. Don't be tempted to make sense out of the story because it leads to questions that invite logic and common sense. The comics can get away with so much because in that world, it comes across as that is what happens in that world. Trying to transfer comics to the screen becomes challenging because trying to bring a super hero to reality is not easy. So we settle for the next best thing which is to make it entertaining. The director pulls that off quite well. In the end, you want to ask your self if you got your monies or tickets worth. The answer is yes. This is not a movie that invites you to come back and see it again. There are no memorable scenes which is its only flaw all things considered.

2012-05-04,"The Avengers is not as good as The Dark Knight, I'm just going to say that from the off, the storyline is escapism and it has some genuinely funny moments in it, but it doesn't have the deep characters or visual spectacle. Joss Whedon's script keeps the film going, and lets be honest, this film could have been a train wreck. What makes The Avengers tick is the relationships that each of the characters have with one another. This is where the film really takes flight, when all the characters are in a pressure cooker together, it gives the film weight and suspense especially with Mark Ruffalo's Hulk. Joss Whedon should be given a lot of credit for crafting such a cohesive and well thought out script.The Dialogue is what keeps it above board, visuals have never been Joss Whedon's strong suit, but I did notice a wink to his first feature film Serenity in zoom shots in the action sequences (see Serenity's finale as the ship falls from the sky). The film doesn't look bad by any means it just has the same sheen that the other Marvel films seem to support, but it didn't really have a choice following suit from its predecessors. But lack of visual flair is sometimes what makes me dislike these movies, they look too clean and have a sheen that makes it look too much like a cartoon for my personal taste. Other Superhero film don't seem to have this ""sheen"", making them more visually pleasing to me - the Nolan and Burton Batman's spring to mind as well as the Marvel Xmen films.The film works equally as well in 2D as it does in 3D, the ""third"" dimension is not needed here, the visual storytelling (though nothing groundbreaking) stands on its own two feet, making the 3D gimmick unnecessary. Its very difficult to score this film as it is by and large a fantastic superhero film, thats enjoyable from beginning to end. But enjoyment isn't all I mark it on, was the story original, well no not at all, it was an accumulation of its heroes solo films. Were the visuals good, yes, but they weren't anything you haven't seen in other similar films. The Avengers is fun and Joss's ingenious and humorous dialogue will make you come back for another sitting, but by and large this isn't a anything more than a summer popcorn film, not that it tries to be more either.

2012-04-26,"Four years ago Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury appeared in Iron Man's end credit scene and whipped the comic book geek-world into a frenzy; it was a hint at larger things to come within the Marvel universe and the fans knew it. Since then we've witnessed a franchise (including The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America) that has excelled in self-referential plugs, character cameos and plot crossovers, all building a giddy excitement towards the main show: The Avengers. It was worth the wait.Writer-director Joss Whedon has concocted a perfect blend of mouth-watering action, laugh-out-loud humour and eye-blistering CGI. Whether it's the excellent Thor vs Iron Man vs Captain America rumble in the forest, the mind-boggingly spectacular 30 minute finale in downtown Manhattan, or any scene with the Hulk, the bruising action is choreographed and executed with a flair not seen in any of the aforementioned standalone movies and, along with the series' best CGI, is likely to have your jaw on the ground. Similarly, the script and dialogue is crafted with such a high level of intelligence and wittiness that every joke hits the mark – the Hulk's reaction to Loki belittling him had me in tears – and the story roars along at a cracking pace, allowing you to glide over the minor gaps in plot. However, perhaps Whedon's most amazing feat is how he balances the screen time among the mammoth cast (who continue their great work from the franchise's previous instalments); he has kept every character in focus, yet never over-shadowing the others, resulting in an ensemble piece that clicks from the get go. The opening act may be a tad slow, but this superhero adventure is a rollicking good ride with genuine awe-inspiring moments.

It made me laugh, get tear eyed, marvel in wonder at pure awesomeness, jump out of my seat, tremble in fear, its just great. Sorry I can't find he words still. As large as he hype to this movie is, it still didn't do justice to how awesome this movie is. gosh!!!Great job Joss Whedon. He really is a passionate comic book writer who does justice to this ensemble, shuffling up things to boiling point between characters and I can't even start to describe his major villain whose actor gives an Oscar worthy performance.Never had a bad-ass bad guy that kept me awestruck this much since he matrix. Tom Hiddlestone does justice to this character in a way that truly signifies a real god of mischief. Scheming and plotting with thoughts and plans coming at split second intervals, Tom Hiddlestone still gives his character that dynamism of a brainiac with deep inner pain that you'd think could boil over at any moment.Mind blowing movie for a super hero generation. If u are a comic book fan, you would drool over this movie and I'm not just saying. If you are not even, there's no reason why you shouldn't watch this movie still.

2012-05-10,"This would be a good movie to take the family to for a movie night, it has everything you would expect from a big summer blockbuster - lots of eye candy with fancy special effects, a simple and understandable straight forward plot, the good guys and bad guys are well defined and in stark black and white so its easy to know who to root for and against.The best part of the movie is the humor, it has a tongue in cheek type style and there are some good laughs in the movie. Its definitely a light-hearted movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.It loses some points for basically being too oriented for a kids audience, it was not really my kind of movie because its almost like a Disney theme park ride, and simple minded in a sense.

I will make this promise, if you see it you will love it!!! If you do not love it, sorry movies are not your thing! Also a shout out to Robert Downey, Jr.( aka. Iron man) he did great!

2012-06-05,"It so happened that ""The Avengers"" has quite naturally and comfortably occupied the box office throne. It almost effortlessly managed to get to the very top and join the selected company of such distinguished titans as ""Avatar"", ""Titanic"", ""Harry Potter"", ""The Lord of the Rings"", and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"".In addition to the dazzling box office glory, ""The Avengers"" is enjoying an unprecedented public love of epic, almost unhealthy, flirting with obsession proportions.Currently ""The Avengers"" confidently occupies the 39th position among the best movies of all time on IMDb – higher on the list than ""Citizen Kane"", ""Alien"", ""American Beauty"", ""Vertigo"", ""The Green Mile"", ""Once Upon A Time in America"",""Amadeus"",""Some Like It Hot"", or ""Gone With The Wind"".The reviewers on Netflix are ecstatic and gush with admiration: ""This was the best super hero movie ever! It had a great plot, and I enjoyed it incredibly!"" ""It has heart! It has humor"" ""Not a dull moment. The cast did an amazing job"" ""I loved this movie. It was fantastic"" ""This movie was amazing! All of the heroes were excellent"" ""The truth is that you can't scream enough praise for this movie""And in the middle of all this euphoric madness, in the midst of all this frenzied rage, in the epicenter of all this outrageous triumph of the mediocrity produced by the never staying idle, overworked Hollywood assembly lines, we can barely hear a few sane, sober voices saying in a childlike amazement ""Wait a minuteThe Emperor is naked!""Yes, despite its colorful, glaring clothes mostly made of special effects, ""The Avengers"" is almost completely naked: there is no story, no good scenes or dialogs, no acting (because there is no substance), no core, no depth, no intrigue, no tension, no mystery, no heart, and, yes – no humor.What is called humor in ""The Avengers"" does indeed have one positive component in it: there is no bathroom jokes so common in the modern comedies. No one is burping, vomiting, breaking winds, showing naked buttocks, doing any other indecencies or saying any other obscenities. Unfortunately, the humor in ""The Avengers"" has also a negative side: it is very primitive and quite unfunny.The special effects in ""The Avengers"" are impressive, but chaotically purposeless, and not breathtaking or intelligent or deeply symbolic as in ""Avatar"" or ""The Lord of the Rings"".The amounts of an exciting action in ""The Avengers"" are vast, and the density of the movie stars would make any blockbuster jealous. Nevertheless, those looking for anything more than a liberally seasoned with primitive humor collection of sloppily connected action sequences and special effects will be utterly disappointed.However, judging by the box office success of ""The Avengers"", nothing else is at all needed... A bunch of the familiar from childhood pathetic cartoonish super heroes cheerfully kicking butts of a little less cartoonish, but still pathetic villains and almost effortlessly but incredibly heroically saving the world in their spare time is just enough to make most movie goers extremely happy.There is nothing mysterious about this - after all, the most popular restaurant in the world is not a restaurant with the best food, or the most famous and skillful chef, or the nicest location, or the most elegant atmosphere, or the most exquisite wine list.The Emperor of restaurants is McDonalds – a familiar from childhood good bargain with standard, very basic, not very healthy, but at the same time very addictive menu.Those highly praising the story, the acting, and all the other non- existent components of ""The Avengers"" become like a patron, who after visiting a local McDonalds would suddenly blurt out something like ""What an elegant atmosphere we enjoyed when we visited McDonalds last time! The waiters were so attentive! The menu was so intriguing! The food was of finest quality and don't forget about the location – the nicest in town!""The hard truth is that whereas in my hypothetical example with McDonalds everyone understands that the patron talks nonsense, most of the moviegoers will not notice a striking discrepancy between the cheap, unimaginative fast food action they see on the screen and all the high praises that ""The Avengers"" receiveIndeed, Wisdom is found on the lips of the discerning, but a rod is for the back of one who has no sense.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com",6.0,2012-06,Tuesday,"about:0.04, acting:0.05, action:0.04, after:0.05, alien:0.03, all:0.11, almost:0.12, also:0.02, amazing:0.05, america:0.02, an:0.07, and:0.15, any:0.07, anything:0.03, are:0.04, as:0.03, at:0.03, avengers:0.15, back:0.03, be:0.01, because:0.02, become:0.04, best:0.06, between:0.03, blockbuster:0.03, but:0.06, by:0.04, can:0.04, cast:0.02, depth:0.04, did:0.02, disappointed:0.03, does:0.02, don:0.02, effects:0.06, else:0.03, enjoyed:0.06, enough:0.05, epic:0.03, ever:0.02, everyone:0.03, excellent:0.03, exciting:0.03, fantastic:0.03, few:0.03, for:0.04, found:0.04, from:0.03, get:0.02, good:0.03, great:0.02, had:0.02, hard:0.03, has:0.08, have:0.01, hero:0.03, heroes:0.04, high:0.03, highly:0.03, hollywood:0.04, however:0.03, humor:0.14, imdb:0.04, impressive:0.04, in:0.19, is:0.19, it:0.10, its:0.02, job:0.03, just:0.02, last:0.03, less:0.03, like:0.05, lines:0.03, little:0.03, looking:0.03, love:0.03, loved:0.03, made:0.02, make:0.04, moment:0.03, more:0.02, most:0.12, movie:0.07, movies:0.02, my:0.02, never:0.02, no:0.28, not:0.07, nothing:0.06, of:0.24, on:0.07, once:0.03, one:0.04, or:0.18, other:0.06, out:0.02, plot:0.02, quite:0.06, same:0.03, scenes:0.02, screen:0.02, see:0.02, sense:0.03, sequences:0.03, so:0.06, some:0.02, something:0.03, special:0.07, stars:0.04, still:0.02, story:0.04, such:0.03, super:0.05, than:0.04, that:0.06, the:0.66, their:0.02, there:0.07, they:0.02, this:0.08, those:0.05, time:0.09, to:0.04, top:0.03, very:0.10, wait:0.03, was:0.06, we:0.07, were:0.04, what:0.04, when:0.02, who:0.04, will:0.04, with:0.09, world:0.05, would:0.04, yes:0.06, you:0.01"

They do not over show one person more then the other. You see them all the same amount which makes the movie so much better! Perfect! I have no complaints about this movie! There has been a lot of people arguing about Mark Ruffalo playing The Hulk. People are worrying that he will not be as good as Edward Norton from the incredible hulk. Well I have news for you... He is better!!!!! He should have been playing hulk/bruce in all the other movies! 10 out of 10 for The Avengers!!!! Fantastic in imax 3d! Fantastic in 2d! Fantastic Movie!

2012-08-07,"I actually was not expecting to be that good but I really got to say that was one of the best movies I have ever seen. A really good plot, the biggest and most amazing scenes of battle ever, spectacular performances by our heroes and all the cast, awesome visuals effects and another amazing soundtrack.One of the things that really impressed me was the fact the each hero received the right amount of time on the screen and for that was possible to see how much work did everyone do.Of course, once more we have the amazing performance of Robert Downey, Jr as Iron Man that gives us the humor and bravery that we wanted to see by this character. But he is not the only good actor in the movie, we also have Chris Evans as Captain America that delivers the leadership needed, Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow that show us how amazing a woman can be in a situation of danger, Chris Hemsworth as Thor that gives us that bravery, strenght and performance we wanted to see from him, Tom Hiddleston as Loki that delivers the big villain with no compassion that this movie needed, Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson funny and brave as always, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill the new woman with a lot of potential, Stellan Skarsgård as Dr. Erik Selvig also great performance, Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye a actor that show us archery like no one and spectacular performance, our Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury funny and amazing as always and another new entrance in the film, Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner / Hulk that delivers the incredible Hulk we all wanted to see.

2013-05-19,"When you stick Iron Man, The Hulk, Thor and Captain America in a film you know its not going to be a walk in the park with tea and scones on a bench. And indeed, there is so much destruction here that when the dust settles, I was amazed to see anything standing at all. True, they may save the Earth, but I bet the property damages in doing so run into the billions. Any insurance guy watching this would have five simultaneous cardiac arrests, so if you fall into that category best to stay home and plan some more obnoxious ads for daytime. But that's another story...There are laughs a-plenty too, with Tony Stark's (AKA Iron Man) flippant comments, Steve Rogers's (AKA Captain America) fish-out-of-water situation, The Hulk's (AKA Bruce Banner) efforts not to GET MAD and Thor's (AKA er... Thor) utterly straight-laced persona. The clash of personalities and their different methods of dealing with the opposition just add to the fun, and Samuel L Jackson has his best role in ages as the eyepatched hard-as-nails leader who puts them together. There is also another member played by Scarlet Johansson called the Black Widow, but I apologise for saying that her part felt like tokenism to pacify all you feminists out there. Sorry, girls. Now make a peanut butter sandwich and finish the washing up. *Slaps her bottom*.There's never a dull moment, and ALL the money is there on the screen. Or in the Cayman Islands accounts of the stars.

It will not do a lot of good for viewers who expect quality in acting, serious plot and dramatic ending w/ special after-effect. Sci-fi battle/actions and latest special effects (and equipment) having no real stand-out personality (you can see from the talk) amount to not much for one to remember the movie about in the line of many other movies that fall in the same footsteps; that is, this action intense extravaganza will be forgotten very quick; even with its attempt to insert some (kid-level) comic events along the way.

2012-09-04,"Since that final clip with Nick Fury and Tony Stark in Iron Man, there was hope that maybe Marvel could really be doing an Avengers movie. 4 years later and 4 movies later (Iron Man 2, Hulk, Thor, Captain America) and we have Joss Wheddon's Avengers. What makes The Avengers so Engaging and Intriguing is the dialogue between the superheroes. Joss Wheddon should be awarded with an Oscar for the writing and directing of The Avengers. Everyone blended in so naturally and their back and fourth banter made for some good comedy. Everyone felt equal from Hawkeye to Hulk. It is so difficult to balance these personalities on screen and I don't think any other director besides Joss would've been able to pull it off the way he did.The Action scenes in the Avengers is as Epic as it gets. The last hour is like a marathon of awesomeness. Every action sequence in this movie was perfectly executed and each character had their significant moments. The cast was phenomenal as usual, but the show-stealer is definitely Mark Ruffalo. His portrayal of the incredible hulk was spot on. He was wildly entertaining and I couldn't help but cheer him on when he smashed sh!t. I think what made the Hulk work was because he was used sparingly.Lo-Ki as the villain was great. I felt he was developed a lot better here than in Thor. He was witty and had an evil aura about him especially when he was interacting with the ""mortals"".Never have I enjoyed a movie so much as the Avengers. The 2 hour plus runtime flew by easily and I was left wanting more once it ended. Once in a while a masterpiece of a film comes along, and after the hilarious closing scene after the credits, it was clear that this was Marvel's Masterpiece. Back to the Future and Terminator 2 have always been my go- to favourite movies.

2013-08-16,"Walking into the movie theatre, I didn't expect very much. I'm glad I didn't, or I would've been disappointed. The movie starts off slowly, and from the get go, everything about it seems... for lack of a better word, dull. With the success of DC Comic's The Dark Knight, the shoes for superhero flicks were large to fill. Marvel's counterpart failed to deliver the same grandiose style, riveting story, and memorable performances.To start off with, the story felt like a patchwork of scenes put together simply to bring earth's mightiest heroes together for what would turn out to be a forty-five minute, Transformers-esque brawl. Some people may say, ""That sounds awesome! Why are you complaining?"" If you said that, this movie is for you. If you want a little more than ""HULK SMASH!"", look somewhere else.To Joss Whedon's credit, he saw that he had a potential home run and did everything possible not to screw it up. If his goal was to make as much money as possible, he was extremely successful. However, because of this ""playing it safe"" philosophy, the movie relies far too heavily on unexplained coincidences in the plot, character backgrounds found in previous Marvel flicks and also, without giving away any spoilers, blatantly ripping off the ending to a certain Star Wars movie that was panned by critics. The Avengers is a decent popcorn flick that killed at the box office; however, it does not transcend the superhero genre to become a truly great film.",7.0,2013-08,Friday,"about:0.05, also:0.06, and:0.11, any:0.06, are:0.04, as:0.08, at:0.05, avengers:0.04, away:0.09, awesome:0.07, be:0.04, because:0.06, become:0.10, been:0.06, better:0.06, bring:0.10, by:0.05, character:0.05, comic:0.06, dark:0.08, did:0.06, didn:0.14, disappointed:0.09, does:0.07, earth:0.08, else:0.09, everything:0.15, expect:0.09, far:0.08, felt:0.09, film:0.04, for:0.14, found:0.10, from:0.04, genre:0.10, get:0.06, giving:0.10, go:0.06, great:0.05, had:0.06, he:0.15, heroes:0.06, his:0.05, however:0.16, hulk:0.04, if:0.15, in:0.06, into:0.06, is:0.06, it:0.11, joss:0.06, knight:0.09, like:0.04, little:0.07, look:0.08, make:0.06, marvel:0.10, may:0.08, money:0.10, more:0.05, movie:0.16, much:0.11, not:0.08, of:0.11, off:0.21, on:0.04, or:0.05, out:0.05, people:0.07, performances:0.09, plot:0.06, previous:0.08, put:0.08, said:0.09, same:0.08, saw:0.08, say:0.06, scenes:0.06, seems:0.09, simply:0.09, some:0.05, star:0.09, start:0.09, story:0.10, superhero:0.11, than:0.05, that:0.16, the:0.36, this:0.06, to:0.28, together:0.11, too:0.06, transformers:0.10, truly:0.10, up:0.05, ve:0.07, very:0.05, want:0.08, was:0.11, were:0.05, what:0.05, whedon:0.06, why:0.07, with:0.07, without:0.08, would:0.11, you:0.16"

Well, not here, The action is unbelievable, the feats of strength breathtaking Ironman shoots its repulsor beams, Thor uses his lightning strike.Lastly it wouldn't have worked without the humor, Wheedon, has perfect chops, each time his punchlines will take you off guard, and trust me laugh you will.I watched this in a really packed theater, the function was sold out one week before, a record in my country.

2012-05-10,"Having seen the previous Marvel movies, I have to say this was probably their best work so far. This movie caters to all ages with plenty of laughs and OMG moments. Sure, the beginning had a bit of a slow start, but once it got on its feet, WOW! Iron Man had a big part in this, being the hilarious, immature playboy to Thor and Captain America's more serious nature. Scarlett Johansson played the part of Black Widow perfectly and Hawk-Eye and the Hulk were both splendid. The villain, Loki, stepped out of the ""typical bad guy"" shadow and made the perfect enemy for these amazing heroes. The effects didn't have that sick, CG look a lot of other hero movies have and the plot was believable. I'll admit, I shed a few tears in some scenes, but seconds later, they brought the laughs right back.

2012-05-12,"Avengers had one of the longest marketing technique used in the movie industry.Its marketing started way back in 2008 with the release of Iron-Man.After 4 years and 5 movies later, that movie is finally released.The Avengers fulfills all the expectations that were raised in this 4 year duration.All the main actors have returned (except Edward Norton ,replaced by Mark Ruffalo for The Hulk) ,and the story is fun ,witty and action packed.The biggest drawbacks most star-studded movies encounter is giving the comparatively more famous actor the biggest chunk of role.Thankfully this was not the deal for Avengers.All the main heroes (IronMan,Captain America ,Thor & Hulk) got equally big as well as important part in the story.The secondary actors (Nick Fury & Black Widow) were not brushed off ,and even with all the superheroes getting the good parts ,these 2 still had major roles.The only character felt unused and a bit expendable was Hawkeye. This speaks volumes of how the story has been handled.Juggling 6-7 heroes and giving each ample screen time is no easy task.In the acting department ,Robert Downey stole the show as he usually does.He was born to play IronMan.In every scene he appears he is in total style and gives IronMan his soul. Both Chris Evans(Captain America) & Chris Hemsworth (Thor) were not bad.Both did equal justice to their roles.Tom Hiddleston (Loki) delivered yet another excellent villainous role ,similar to the one he did in Thor.Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) had a surprisingly longer and major role and she too gives her best.Jeremy Renner (HawkEye) was too rigid ,this may be due to his role not being fully fledged.Samuel J(Nick Fury) was good. But the true show stealer was Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk.The Hulk will indeed be EVERYONE's favourite character once they have seen Avengers.Every scene & action scene by Hulk is just Pure Awesomeness.Story as i previously said is truly noteworthy because of the huge juggling acting of giving each Hero their own connection with the movie.But in terms of story telling ,it falters just a bit.The story makes way for the action and takes the backseat.While the first half concentrates on the story ,the second is completely action based.Action scenes are superb.The numerous fight scenes,hero vs hero,hero vs hoardes ,heroes vs the villain ,ALL are properly choreographed and exciting.Direction was great.The way Joss Whedon managed to direct this movie with these many superheroes and mixing them and giving one solid movie is truly remarkable.On the downside the first half was riddled with pacing issues.Some dragging scenes in the first half drained the excitement after some great fights.But once the Hulk appears ,the movie just blasts off to high levels of awesomeness never to go down again.The real Avengers movie starts with The Hulk and ends with him too. The dialogues were witty and funny ,and Robert Downey's style of delivery & Hulk's grunts of words steal many scenes away.Overall Avengers is a colourful,funny,action packed movie that delivers its promise of a United Super Heroes movie.The movie might not be legendary ,but The Hulk & Robert Downey will not be forgotten.

2012-08-27,"Where to start. Me and my wife watched this movie yesterday, to forget about the drama called 'battleship' (don't get me started.) But it's hard to choose the most retarded movie between the two. This one had some okay jokes in it, but like many people said: you don't feel any threat, you don't feel any story, you just see special effects and ""UHMERICA F* YAA"" 2hrs straight. The effects were good, and the Hulk smashed like he never smashed before, but every movie starts sucking as soon as you realize nobody of the good guys can actually die. (Lord Of the rings anyone?) and when legions of 10x more bad-ass alien monsters are killed throwing a chair at them or blind-aimed headshotting them with a bow on a spaceship going 300mph, you know you're just wasting your time.

2012-04-30,"Ten out of TenI along with my friend went to watch this movie on the basis of IMDb reviews. And boy !! The reviews didn't disappoint us. Why I was not having too much expectations on this movie  1. 6 Heroes !! Its very difficult to give enough screen time to all of them and at the same time keep the pace of the movie as well. (Spider Man 3 was a classic example of this goof up) 2. Was concerned about the Mega Villain. 3.Bad reactions on the casting of Mark Ruffalo as HULK. 4. Lately, a lot of Super hero movies were flops or average. (Green Lantern & Iron Man)But now, I would definitely ask you all to watch this movie.. coz . 1. The movie has cleverly given the screen time to everybody. 2.Loki made a tough Villain to beat alone. 3. Everybody loved Mark and as well as the HULK. 4. Timing of the funny moments were spot on. 5.Technologically good as par with Avatar and Transformer 3. 6. The best Super Hero Movie out now with Batman series. 7.

2012-05-09,"Like many people, who have been fast forwarding the credits to see the teasing snippet at the end in the Iron Man films, Thor, Captain America etc, I was ridiculously excited to see this film. I'll hold my hands up now and admit that I am a huge sci-fi nerd and regard Thor and Iron Man 1 as two of my favourite ever films (along with titles such as the recent Star Trek, or the Lord of the Rings trilogy). Needless to say, I was not disappointed. This film was, there's only one way to put this... INCREDIBLE! The special effects were out of the world, literally the best effects I have ever seen, on a larger scale than the most recent Transformers film, but less in your face and over powering. The effects were first rate, completely seamless and is definitely something to watch on the big screen, rather than wait for the DVD.I found that the acting was really good as well, everyone pulling their weight with a big nod towards Tom Hiddleston who i believe was one of the stars of the show. Definitely the best Hulk there has ever been and Chris Hemsworth was utterly fantastic. Needless to say, Robert Downey Jr will deserve all the plaudits he takes from this film as he was brilliant, as always, in his role of Tony Stark. Even Scarlett Johansson, who many assumed would just be ""token bo__"" was really good and her character had surprising depth.This is one of those films where you cant help but smile while watching it as you follow an incredible story line while witnessing faultless special affects. I cannot recommend this film enough, I have seen it once at the cinema and have already booked tickets to go see it again.

2012-04-27,"I don't care about what some people say on how this movie just had action and no story and cheesy humor because those people obviously have no taste. Anyways, I just got a chance to see the most awaited film of 2012 and honestly, I wasn't disappointed. The movie was actually the most epic movie I have seen so far. Yes, I might change this decision after I see The Dark Knight Rises or MIB 3 but this movie has certainly impressed me. The movie has major plus points and one of them is the dialogs. The mix of action and humorous dialogs entertain and provide good moments to appease the audiences. I am sure, several people loved the dialogs but I just admired them. The action scenes, were not overdone and were certainly better than G.I Joe series which was not really anything impressive for me. But, there is a lot more to this film that gave me that feeling that this is the epic movie and It wasn't a waste to wait for so long. The action scenes are good, though there was a lot of explosions, they impress. The best part is the acting, our superheroes and even our villain say funny dialogs and perform good action. Plus, the story is effective for a 2 hour movie as many movies longer than 1 hour 30 mins are usually lagging in parts and fail to present a good story. But, this movie doesn't drag and doesn't make you fall asleep. Acting is top notch, Robert Downy Jr. is the best, Thor is good, Captain America, the rest are awesome.

2012-07-29,"I remember this being largely anticipated. I watched the Iron Man movies, so I was going to see this. It had lots of action, but the plot was a little weak. I also didn't understand why they took the villain from Thor and couldn't use someone like Thanos (which is rumored to be the villain for the sequel). Yeah, it had lots of jokes but most of them were too cheesy for me. The best jokes come from Iron Man. It gets a bit boring in the middle part. Overall, I don't think this is a bad movie but I don't think it deserves a spot on the top 250. You should also know I almost never give movies a 10/10. Also the fan base for it is a bit annoying but I should leave that out. The plot is basically a bunch of middle-aged superheroes coming together to fight one of the superhero's brother and his army of Skrulls or Chiatauris if you will. Ruffalo's performance as the Hulk was the best out of any of them, unfortunately there is no Hulk sequel planned for MCU: Phase 2.

2014-07-23,"I will start out by saying that overall, I did enjoy this film. I feel like the rating system here on IMDb is used so incorrectly by the majority of folks who use it. For example, if someone loved this movie, they give it a 10. If they didn't like it, they give it a 1, where the truth actually lies somewhere in the middle. Everything is NOT black and white in movies, and I feel like this movie is an unfortunate byproduct of that misconception. With a star studded cast and some pretty incredible visuals, ""The Avengers"" does many things well that a superhero movie should. What this movie doesn't do well is deliver a unique ""gosh that's the best superhero movie i've ever seen!"" experience, despite what the inflated rating would tell you. The plot of ""The Avengers"" features a pretty basic premise; The US government, naive to their own research on a mysterious object called the Tesseract, accidentally opens a rift to another world allowing the Norse god Loki to enter Earth and essentially wreak havoc. This of course leads to the formation of ""The Avengers"", which is a collection of Marvel superheroes that many of you will recognize, either from the comic books or previous Marvel films. Together, under ""The Avengers initiative"", these superheroes go to battle with Loki over the sacred Tesseract which, when wielded by Loki, can open a rift to another dimension and potentially end the world as we know it. Sound familiar? It should, as this general pretense has been used many times over in the past. While the plot doesn't feature any large holes, it also doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table, either. You can expect many ""mini"" battles between Loki and the heroes along the way, ultimately leading to the ""final showdown"" of the film. This is superhero movie 101, and while it works for all intensive purposes, ""The Avengers"" hardly innovates the genre in any way. Based on it's high rating, I had expected a somewhat unique experience for a superhero movie, but I was unfortunately let down in this regard. The movie does pace itself quite well, however, which kept me interested throughout. If there is one thing ""The Avengers"" does very well, it's keeping the viewer interested without any serious lulls in the action. Next up is the acting/casting. This movie is literally jam packed with famous actors/actresses, from Robert Downey Jr. as the always recognizable Iron Man(my personal favorite from not just these films but all in the Marvel collection), Chris Evans as Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk, and Chris Hemsworth returning as Thor(my second favorite of these characters). There are many others, from Scarlett Johansson, to Samuel L. Jackson, to Jeremy Renner, etc etc. You get the idea. There are lots of famous people in this movie. The acting from these heavyweights of the industry is generally very good, despite a pretty generic script. You can expect a lot of cheesy one-liners, petty arguments, and general ""i'm a better superhero than you"" moments throughout the script. With a lack of clever writing and, in my honest opinion, a truly despicable villain(Loki just doesn't do it for me, sorry. He looks like a 15 year old boy with a deer helmet), ""The Avengers"" has a hard time distinguishing itself from the pack, despite all the talented actors involved with this film. One could really make the argument that the talented actors casted for this film ARE what makes the movie above average, because they really have to make the most out of what they are given in the script. Overall, ""The Avengers"" offers an exciting, albeit predictable, superhero experience. The actors bring their A-game for this film and the electricity between them definitely makes this movie better. I do have to say I felt a bit of nostalgia watching some of my favorite heroes from childhood band together on the big screen to battle evil. Despite it's fairly long runtime, ""The Avengers"" kept me interested from start to finish even if I cringed at some of the writing from time to time. Overall though, I think it was the villain, Loki, who brought the viewing experience down for me. He just isn't believable as a true villain, and the ""twist"" at the end will leave you feeling pretty underwhelmed. Despite these fall backs, though, this is still an enjoyable film to watch. If you expect something more than a 2 hour superhero romp coming into this, you may find yourself a bit disappointed like I was. If you come into this thinking that you will see some cool superhero action and some great actors, you will be much better off. ""The Avengers"" is a cool superhero movie, but in my opinion, nothing more. This film isn't American Beauty or even the Dark Knight(best superhero movie ever IMO), so as long as you temper your expectations, you will more than likely enjoy ""The Avengers"". For an exciting, if somewhat underwhelming, superhero experience, I give ""The Avengers"" a solid 6/10.",6.0,2014-07,Wednesday,"10:0.04, acting:0.05, action:0.03, actors:0.12, actually:0.03, all:0.03, along:0.03, also:0.02, always:0.03, america:0.02, an:0.06, and:0.11, another:0.05, any:0.06, anything:0.03, are:0.05, as:0.11, at:0.03, avengers:0.15, battle:0.05, be:0.01, because:0.02, been:0.02, best:0.03, better:0.06, between:0.05, big:0.02, bit:0.05, black:0.02, bring:0.06, brought:0.03, but:0.03, by:0.05, can:0.05, captain:0.02, cast:0.02, characters:0.01, chris:0.05, come:0.02, comic:0.02, coming:0.03, cool:0.06, could:0.02, course:0.03, dark:0.03, definitely:0.03, did:0.02, didn:0.02, disappointed:0.03, do:0.06, does:0.06, doesn:0.10, down:0.05, downey:0.02, earth:0.02, end:0.05, enjoy:0.05, evans:0.02, even:0.04, ever:0.04, everything:0.02, evil:0.03, exciting:0.09, expect:0.09, expectations:0.03, expected:0.03, experience:0.15, favorite:0.08, feel:0.05, felt:0.03, film:0.10, films:0.04, final:0.03, find:0.03, for:0.09, from:0.13, genre:0.03, get:0.02, give:0.07, given:0.03, go:0.02, god:0.03, good:0.01, great:0.02, had:0.02, hard:0.03, has:0.03, have:0.03, he:0.03, hemsworth:0.02, here:0.02, heroes:0.04, high:0.03, hour:0.03, however:0.03, hulk:0.01, idea:0.03, if:0.11, imdb:0.03, in:0.11, incredible:0.03, into:0.04, iron:0.02, is:0.11, isn:0.06, it:0.12, itself:0.06, jackson:0.02, jeremy:0.03, johansson:0.02, jr:0.02, just:0.04, knight:0.03, know:0.02, let:0.03, like:0.07, loki:0.10, long:0.05, looks:0.03, lot:0.02, loved:0.03, make:0.04, makes:0.05, man:0.01, many:0.10, mark:0.02, marvel:0.05, may:0.03, me:0.07, moments:0.03, more:0.05, most:0.02, movie:0.14, movies:0.02, much:0.02, my:0.08, new:0.02, next:0.03, not:0.03, nothing:0.03, of:0.15, off:0.02, old:0.03, on:0.05, one:0.04, opinion:0.06, or:0.05, others:0.03, out:0.03, over:0.04, overall:0.08, own:0.02, packed:0.03, past:0.03, people:0.02, plot:0.04, pretty:0.10, previous:0.03, quite:0.03, rating:0.09, really:0.03, renner:0.03, robert:0.02, ruffalo:0.02, samuel:0.03, say:0.02, scarlett:0.02, screen:0.02, script:0.08, second:0.03, see:0.02, seen:0.02, serious:0.03, should:0.05, so:0.03, some:0.08, something:0.02, star:0.03, start:0.06, still:0.02, superhero:0.20, superheroes:0.04, tesseract:0.06, than:0.05, that:0.07, the:0.51, their:0.03, them:0.02, there:0.05, these:0.10, they:0.07, thing:0.02, things:0.03, think:0.02, this:0.17, thor:0.02, though:0.05, throughout:0.06, time:0.05, times:0.03, to:0.14, together:0.04, true:0.03, truly:0.03, up:0.02, us:0.03, used:0.06, ve:0.02, very:0.04, villain:0.07, was:0.03, watch:0.02, watching:0.02, way:0.04, we:0.02, well:0.06, what:0.06, when:0.02, where:0.02, which:0.06, while:0.05, who:0.04, will:0.10, with:0.07, without:0.02, world:0.04, would:0.02, writing:0.06, year:0.03, you:0.18, your:0.02"

2012-04-27,"Avengers turned out to be as thrilling and exciting as its first teaser. I was waiting for this movie from the time they announced it and my joy knew no bounds when I saw the movie tonight. In one word – Superb. I don't mind watching it once again. S.H.I.E.L.D director, Nick Fury is threatened by Loki and his armed forces. Loki is sinister brother of Thor who was dethroned from Kingdom of Asgard for his misdeeds. He plans an attack on Earth by opening a portal through which his army can arrive into the Earth from Asgard and wage a war against mankind and turn human into Loki's slave. In order to protect Earth from destruction, Nick Fury assembles a team of superheroes represented by Ironman , Captain America , Thor and Hulk along with Black Widow and HawkEye. Together , they must fight the evil Loki before he captures the people of earth and turns them into his slave It would have been really challenging for Joss Whedon, director of Serenity, to make a film by assembling all the superheroes in one flick but to my surprise he did a fantastic job and turned this comic-story into a must-see film. The movie begins by introducing each superhero character and their personalities. Of course, if you would have followed their original parts then this will be easy to continue. The differences between the characters has been portrayed ecstatically. 1st half is more of story building where as it is the 2nd half which gathers steam and makes it more entertaining. Couple of scenes that easily stands out are the introduction of Hulk , the fight between Thor and Ironman and especially the climax scenes where the main fighting is depicted. Screenplay is effective along with punching dialogues Cinematography is enthralling. The CGI is magnificent with thrilling visual effects. On the flip side , any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here. Nevertheless, it is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the starcast. Robert Downey Jr. clearly stands out in his portrayal of Ironman and witty one- liners. He is just getting better with each film. Surprisingly, I liked Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/The Hulk. His puts in so much effort and is complete natural when as Bruce Banner and his change of expression as The Hulk. Overall , an action-packed entertainment with good storyline , lovely performances and superb CGI. It is a must see film which will give you an urge to go for the second time as well.

2012-05-14,"I was lucky enough to score tickets to a prescreening of The Avengers in my city. I'd loved all the other Marvel movies leading up to it, so I was really stoked. The Avengers is the superhero movie we've been waiting for. Don't get me wrong, I love the darkness of other superhero movies, like The Dark Knight, but as Nick Fury aptly puts it: ""maybe we need a little old-fashioned"". And this movie is exactly that. Joss Whedon gives us precisely what superheroes used to be - extraordinary people fighting their flaws to become the saviors of the human race. In all fairness, The Avengers is not a film that requires much thought. It's a beautiful spectacle, but it definitely does not possess Oscar-worthy performances. It's slightly campy and tongue-in-cheek, which is oddly refreshing. The Avengers never takes itself too seriously, which I think a lot of people aren't getting (hence some extremely scathing reviews on here!)With the exception of Mark Ruffalo, every actor has gotten a chance to explore their characters in a previous movie, which adds to the ""easy-breezy feel"" of the movie. That being said, I thought Mark Ruffalo was a wonderful Bruce Banner -- I'd love to see him in his own movie. The action is non-stop and the CGI is phenomenal. However, this is another case of unnecessary 3D. It's didn't add anything to the effects, except muddle them up on occasion when there was a lot going on. This movie could be shown normally and it would almost be better. Believe the hype. This is an awesome movie. Joss Whedon did an fantastic job with the movie.

2012-04-25,"The Avengers is exactly what I expected. It is action packed, it understandably doesn't have much time for character development (although we do see more of Hawkeye and Black Widow than in previous Marvel installments), and the relentless action is accompanied by some fairly good jokes to ease the tension here and there - especially by Tony Stark and, surprisingly, the Hulk (they actually managed to throw in at least two genuinely funny moments around Hulk's utter brutality).The lack of character development, especially for Thor (who does seem somewhat out of place in this film) but also Bruce Banner, is probably what hurts The Avengers the most. I didn't actually need any character development since I've seen all previous Marvel films at least twice, but it nonetheless does stand as a drawback - it feels wrong even though I was expecting it considering the number of characters already established. I can hardly imagine anyone who hasn't seen the previous films enjoying The Avengers because of that.I usually don't care that much for relentless CGI action films, but some sequences in The Avengers were so blatantly incredible that I had to enjoy them. Notably, a sequence during the huge battle sees the camera pan from one Avenger kicking butt to the other - that was really well done and exciting.

2012-05-05,"It pains me to say that because I was a Spiderman fan growing up and Spiderman started off this Superhero crazed movie run with what was the best movie. What made Spiderman stand apart was that it was a great movie and a great Superhero movie. Well, move over because Avengers did most everything right enough to at least have a discussion of whether Spiderman 1 or Avengers 1 was the better movie. It might have helped that I do not know the Avenger lore as well as I knew others, but everyone else is in agreement. I am reluctant about this statement, because you hear something is the best ever and then it never lives up. I read a lot of hype in these pages before I went and saw it. Now I have seen it and must agree with the hype.One thing I was afraid of: Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk, which I am a little still out on, but I do like Mark Ruffalo, but made Bruce Banner a little too weak/effeminate. It comes together nicely though. Another was ScarJo. Yes, she is sexy enough(understatement) but was she athletic enough to carry it out and she did well enough. Another problem, the bravado/""egos"" of the characters, not stars, but characters of such a movie would demand a lot of screen time for each one to make this work. That would be a problem if it was not accomplished. The movie was very good on this point. Cobie, Robin from How I met Your Mother, was a bit of a distraction for me in a secondary role, but did a competent job. The most interesting thing for me was that Joss Whendon was Director and Writer. He created Buffy/ Angel, Firefly/Dollhouse. I wondered how he would do with such mainstream fair and he managed to bring everything together almost perfectly. I say almost because there is one bit that is missing. It is somewhat minor, but who taught Bruce Banner the secret to control his angry green side. That is the only piece missing for me.For those that want specifics: effects were top notch, acting was excellent, story lines were compelling, the comedy was perfect 99.5% of the time and surprise there were a lot of one line typical superhero zingers that worked really well.I think you will enjoy this movie, unless you only enjoy completely realistic movies.",10.0,2012-05,Saturday,"about:0.03, acting:0.05, almost:0.11, am:0.10, and:0.15, another:0.10, as:0.07, at:0.03, avenger:0.06, avengers:0.05, banner:0.09, be:0.03, because:0.16, before:0.05, best:0.07, better:0.04, bit:0.10, bring:0.06, bruce:0.10, but:0.15, characters:0.06, comedy:0.06, comes:0.05, did:0.12, director:0.05, do:0.12, each:0.04, effects:0.04, else:0.06, enjoy:0.10, enough:0.19, ever:0.04, everyone:0.05, everything:0.09, excellent:0.06, fan:0.05, for:0.11, from:0.03, good:0.03, great:0.06, have:0.08, he:0.10, his:0.03, how:0.08, hulk:0.03, hype:0.12, if:0.03, in:0.06, interesting:0.06, is:0.13, it:0.18, job:0.05, joss:0.04, know:0.04, least:0.06, like:0.03, line:0.06, lines:0.06, little:0.09, lot:0.13, made:0.08, make:0.04, mark:0.08, me:0.14, might:0.06, most:0.07, movie:0.16, movies:0.03, must:0.05, never:0.04, not:0.07, now:0.04, of:0.16, off:0.04, on:0.05, one:0.10, only:0.07, or:0.03, others:0.06, out:0.06, over:0.04, perfect:0.05, perfectly:0.06, point:0.06, read:0.06, really:0.03, right:0.05, role:0.06, ruffalo:0.08, saw:0.05, say:0.08, screen:0.04, seen:0.04, she:0.18, something:0.05, stand:0.06, stars:0.06, still:0.04, story:0.03, such:0.10, superhero:0.11, that:0.19, the:0.23, then:0.04, there:0.06, these:0.04, thing:0.10, think:0.04, this:0.09, those:0.05, though:0.05, time:0.06, to:0.11, together:0.07, too:0.04, top:0.05, up:0.06, very:0.03, want:0.05, was:0.34, well:0.13, went:0.06, were:0.10, what:0.06, which:0.04, who:0.03, will:0.03, with:0.07, work:0.05, would:0.10, yes:0.06, you:0.08, your:0.05"

2012-05-12,"like i thought so...the characters simply cant be in one movie. It degrades each character because each one has its own environment. Iron man in the technological world...Captain America's character i still cant understand..he is only got that freaking shield that is unique about him. I mean seriously what kinda superhero is he. Thor and his gods which belong somewhere in lord of the ring or something. Hulk who exists due to some chemical reactions and interactions or gamma rays. Each character has a different theme and environment. Bringing them together isn't right. The acting of most of the actors was normal, actually at times it felt they were in a play not a movie. the story is abit silly or i should say typical. It felt like this was a Walt Disney movie and ironically enough it turned out to be a Walt Disney movie, But on the other hand ....the special effects were amazing and there were some funny scenes.

2012-05-06,"Movie Review: The Avengers (2012) by DareDevilKid.DDKMy Rating: 8.5/10Yes! Oh, boy did this movie deliver! Its like all the cogs fitted perfectly in a well oiled mechanism. Director Joss Whedon has made a brilliant transition from the small to the big screen. The Director has delivered a classic Action/Adventure film of epic proportions. And this was no little achievement, considering all the legendary characters of folklore mostly possessing their individual blockbusters - some really good and some plain mediocre -, which were amalgamated into one huge vista.All the superheroes & even the super-villain merge into the plot beautifully and appear exactly at the opportune moments. Even a somewhat throwaway hero like Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) feels vital. Her fight scenes are Buffy cool. Hemsworth and Evans are more relaxed, more comfortable in their spandex skin. If there's an underused super it's Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) but in the last act he impresses, too.But The true standout is The Hulk. Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner pulls off the trick of allowing his inner rage to simmer just below the surface the whole time. And when the green dude shows up, stand back and just enjoy. He's the first version of Hulk to make his burst of power feel so gratifying. His destructive nature is infectious. Also an honorable mentions have to bestowed upon Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man & Chris Hemsworth's - he's really growing with each passing film - Thor, who adequately support Mark Ruffalo and his alter-ego throughout the movie.The Avengers looks great. The reportedly $250 million budget is on the screen. Many scenes have a great deal of variety. Not just well- choreographed action, there's a cleverness to the very idea to many of the scenes. Whedon pushes his heroes to their limits. When your script can put demigod Thor in peril that's incredible.The plot is simple yet effective - Thor's evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston - a slimy megalomaniac) has taken a cube called the Tesseract that harnesses limitless energy and aliens from another dimension intend to invade Earth to get it. Its easy to follow and merges well into the narration to let the film deliver what audiences really want to see - these ultimate superheroes becoming a team and kicking much butt.The action is magnanimous, the CGI effects are dazzling but ushered only when required, great and witty one-liners are interspersed intermittently, the humor is enthralling, the set-pieces are brilliant, each character is painstakingly developed, the narration is crisp and finally but most importantly, the action makes sense - a rarity for action adventure movies nowadays - in a way that you follow each minutest detail even while its bursting on screen at the rate of knots. The action occurs only after enough plot and character detailing and even when it occurs, it smoothly takes the plot forward. This rare feat elevates Whedon as the real superhero of this film.'The Avengers' reminds us of the reason we love movies ant buy tickets for admittance in a cinema hall. It will keep drawing you back for more, as viewing it just once is insulting and will leave you just plain unsatisfied. The euphoria you experience after completing this exalting visual odyssey will settle only after many long hours and then the realization will ultimately dawn - that you have been privileged to witness an classic that will be indelibly etched in cinematic archives.",10.0,2012-05,Sunday,"2012:0.05, action:0.13, after:0.10, all:0.05, also:0.03, an:0.07, and:0.22, another:0.04, are:0.10, as:0.04, at:0.05, avengers:0.06, back:0.08, banner:0.04, be:0.02, been:0.03, big:0.03, black:0.03, brilliant:0.10, brother:0.04, bruce:0.04, but:0.07, by:0.03, can:0.03, cgi:0.04, character:0.06, characters:0.02, chris:0.04, cinema:0.05, cinematic:0.05, cool:0.05, did:0.03, director:0.08, downey:0.03, each:0.09, earth:0.04, effects:0.03, enjoy:0.04, enough:0.04, epic:0.05, evans:0.04, even:0.11, evil:0.05, experience:0.05, feel:0.04, feels:0.05, fight:0.04, film:0.09, finally:0.04, first:0.03, for:0.05, from:0.05, get:0.03, good:0.02, great:0.07, has:0.07, have:0.06, hawkeye:0.03, he:0.08, hemsworth:0.08, her:0.05, hero:0.04, heroes:0.03, hiddleston:0.04, his:0.14, hours:0.05, huge:0.04, hulk:0.04, humor:0.04, idea:0.05, if:0.03, in:0.11, incredible:0.04, individual:0.05, into:0.09, iron:0.02, is:0.13, it:0.09, its:0.09, jeremy:0.04, johansson:0.04, joss:0.03, jr:0.03, just:0.12, keep:0.05, last:0.04, let:0.05, like:0.05, little:0.04, loki:0.03, long:0.04, looks:0.05, love:0.04, made:0.03, make:0.03, makes:0.04, man:0.02, many:0.10, mark:0.06, moments:0.04, more:0.08, most:0.03, movie:0.05, movies:0.05, much:0.03, no:0.03, not:0.02, of:0.14, off:0.04, on:0.04, once:0.04, one:0.04, only:0.09, perfectly:0.05, plot:0.13, power:0.05, put:0.04, rating:0.05, real:0.04, really:0.08, reason:0.05, renner:0.04, review:0.05, robert:0.03, ruffalo:0.06, scarlett:0.04, scenes:0.09, screen:0.10, script:0.04, see:0.03, sense:0.05, set:0.05, simple:0.05, so:0.02, some:0.05, stand:0.05, super:0.07, superhero:0.03, superheroes:0.07, takes:0.05, team:0.03, tesseract:0.05, that:0.08, the:0.56, their:0.08, then:0.03, there:0.05, these:0.03, this:0.08, thor:0.07, throughout:0.05, time:0.02, to:0.19, tom:0.04, too:0.03, true:0.05, up:0.03, us:0.04, very:0.03, villain:0.04, visual:0.05, want:0.04, was:0.02, way:0.03, we:0.03, well:0.08, were:0.03, what:0.03, whedon:0.09, when:0.11, which:0.03, while:0.04, who:0.03, whole:0.04, widow:0.03, will:0.13, with:0.02, witty:0.05, yet:0.04, you:0.10, your:0.04"

2012-05-08,"This is what we have been waiting for. The culmination of years of planning, years of filming and years of cross-pollination of characters throughout the Marvel movie universe. The bar was set unbelievably high and I did my best to temper my expectations as I walked into the theater along with the millions upon millions of moviegoers this opening weekend. When the lights dropped, I mentally wiped the slate clean and hoped beyond hope that it was good (at least better than Iron Man 2). As so many other people have said by now, I was more than pleased.The Avengers follows the beginning of one of Marvel comics most powerful supergroups, as the world finds itself woefully unprepared for an alien onslaught led by the scorned demi-god, Loki. While the various heroes don't play nicely together at first, they come together when the time comes and prove they are much more powerful together than apart. Together, they are unstoppable.Many of the reviews have been focusing on Mark Ruffalo and his charismatic portrayal of Bruce Banner, aka The Hulk. Originally much of the focus was on him because he is now the third actor in as many films to play the legendary green behemoth. Yet after the release, the buzz stayed on him because he brought something to Hulk that was sorely lacking before, humanity. Arguably Ruffalo wasn't on screen a ton and it's hard to say whether we have been so amazed with his performance if it was ninety minutes or more, but since Marvel and company immediately signed him to a six-picture deal to continue being big, green and angry, we will all get our chance to test the theory out. I've always loved Ruffalo as an actor and I have all the faith in the world he can make this rage monster a dynamic character to watch, but the real gamble will come in the script. We've seen full movies with Eric Bana and Edward Norton already, so this next one (or two, or three) need to bring something different, not just a rehash of those before. Luckily, the Avengers phenomenon also allows the next Hulk picture to skip over the origin story, since it's fairly unnecessary now.While Ruffalo can rightly bask in the glow of a job exceedingly well done, the rest of the cast deserves praise as well. Everyone up and down the line brought their A-game and they played off each other incredibly well. Robert Downey Jr. can sometimes overshadow people on screen, just due to his charisma, but he did exactly what he said his character of Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, couldn't doplay nicely with others. However, the pressure was really more on Jeremy Renner (as Hawkeye) and Scarlett Johansson (as Black Widow) since they were only side jobs in some of the previous Marvel chapters. Each did a great job, with extra credit given to Johannson (and possibly her fight double if she had one) for her intro sequence with the Russian mobsters.I can't close this review out without bringing up one of the real-life superheros of the story, writer/director Joss Whedon. The man is a living legend in the geek community and this film proves the accolades and unending praise are well-founded. He achieved a perfect balance of action, pace, and story all while managing to encompass the overabundance of characters. Jokes were well-timed and well-delivered and he allowed for possibly risky moments to go all out, resulting in one of the most hilarious and enjoyable scenes in Marvel movie history (you'll know it when you see it).Sure, there are some nit-picky moments that you can dig up if you're so inclined. Feel free to send me what you think those might be and I'll gladly drop in some of mine. Yet, in the end, the experience is what counts and I couldn't wipe the smile off my face as I left (and not just because the final extra scene at the end of the final credits was pure genius). This movie captured absolutely every bit of the tone and energy of a comic book summer blockbuster and if Whedon was a professor, this would be his Master Class.",10.0,2012-05,Tuesday,"absolutely:0.04, action:0.02, actor:0.07, after:0.03, alien:0.03, all:0.06, along:0.04, already:0.03, also:0.02, always:0.03, an:0.04, and:0.27, are:0.06, as:0.14, at:0.06, avengers:0.03, banner:0.03, be:0.03, because:0.07, been:0.07, before:0.06, beginning:0.04, being:0.03, best:0.02, better:0.03, big:0.03, bit:0.03, black:0.02, blockbuster:0.04, book:0.03, bring:0.04, brought:0.08, bruce:0.03, but:0.04, by:0.04, can:0.10, cast:0.03, character:0.04, characters:0.04, come:0.05, comes:0.03, comic:0.02, comics:0.03, couldn:0.08, credits:0.04, did:0.07, different:0.03, director:0.03, do:0.02, don:0.02, done:0.03, down:0.03, downey:0.02, each:0.05, end:0.06, every:0.03, everyone:0.03, expectations:0.03, experience:0.04, face:0.04, feel:0.03, fight:0.03, film:0.02, films:0.02, final:0.07, first:0.02, for:0.05, full:0.04, get:0.02, given:0.04, go:0.03, god:0.03, good:0.02, great:0.02, had:0.02, hard:0.03, have:0.08, hawkeye:0.03, he:0.14, her:0.07, heroes:0.02, high:0.03, him:0.09, his:0.11, hope:0.04, however:0.03, hulk:0.05, if:0.08, in:0.12, into:0.02, iron:0.04, is:0.05, it:0.07, itself:0.04, jeremy:0.03, job:0.06, johansson:0.03, joss:0.02, jr:0.02, just:0.05, know:0.03, least:0.03, left:0.04, life:0.03, line:0.04, ll:0.07, loki:0.02, loved:0.04, make:0.02, man:0.05, many:0.08, mark:0.02, marvel:0.09, me:0.02, might:0.04, minutes:0.04, moments:0.06, more:0.08, most:0.05, movie:0.04, movies:0.02, much:0.04, my:0.06, need:0.03, next:0.07, norton:0.04, not:0.03, now:0.08, of:0.27, off:0.06, on:0.10, one:0.08, only:0.02, or:0.06, other:0.04, others:0.03, our:0.04, out:0.06, over:0.03, people:0.05, perfect:0.03, performance:0.04, play:0.12, played:0.03, previous:0.03, re:0.03, real:0.07, really:0.02, renner:0.03, rest:0.04, review:0.04, reviews:0.04, robert:0.02, ruffalo:0.10, said:0.07, say:0.03, scarlett:0.03, scene:0.03, scenes:0.02, screen:0.05, script:0.03, see:0.02, seen:0.02, set:0.03, she:0.04, since:0.09, so:0.07, some:0.06, something:0.06, stark:0.03, story:0.06, summer:0.04, sure:0.03, than:0.07, that:0.04, the:0.50, theater:0.04, their:0.02, there:0.02, they:0.09, think:0.02, this:0.09, those:0.06, throughout:0.04, time:0.02, to:0.17, together:0.09, tony:0.03, two:0.03, universe:0.03, up:0.06, ve:0.06, was:0.13, wasn:0.04, watch:0.02, we:0.10, well:0.12, were:0.04, what:0.08, whedon:0.05, when:0.06, while:0.09, widow:0.02, will:0.04, with:0.08, without:0.03, world:0.05, would:0.02, years:0.09, yet:0.07, you:0.08"
2012-04-30,"The Avengers has been the trend for the past few days. Everybody had only good things to say about the movie, and so I decided to watch it. Well, it was not that good, not for me at least.The film is a visual extravaganza, competing on the number of villains and visual graphics scene by scene. If that is what you want from a movie, then don't read the rest, just go and watch the movie, you won't be disappointed.But what the movie really lacks is a good solid storyline. It is as if the director wanted the movie to feature this much of characters and they should all get the same amount of screen time, let it be at the expense of the story! That is the main issue with the movie.Upto the interval, the movie just drags on, the usual stuff with the villain trying to steal an energy source and the superhero team assembling to get it back. There is another interesting thing here. The villain actually tries to manipulate the team and let them fight each other, and this goes on and on and on in the first half. Really, absolutely boring with clichés all over. No creativity of any sort.In a superhero movie, one thing we expect is the introduction of the superheroes. Well, introduction???? There was no such thing, they just walked on to the scene saying, ""Hi, there"". No thrill, no excitement , no sheer blood rushing through the veins scene.And some people were there for no reason at all. I do not know what Black Widow and Captain America did. They just felt like minnows compared to the Hulk and Thor and co.The cast was good anyway. Well they are not doing their roles for the first time, are they? so no credit there to the Avengers Team. Jeremie Renner, Scarlet Johansson and Robert Downey Jr were superb.After the interval, the movie gains some pace and it is all action. This is where the movie becomes watchable. Actually I liked the second half of the movie. Action does not need story or dialogues, does it? May be that is why. And last but not the least, is that guy Loki really a villain or a joker?? Is that what a villain is? never terrifying, not even for a 2-year-old. and in the end """"""Spoiler alert"""""""""""" Hulk thrashes him and says ""puny god"". some villain, ha???!!!I am a big fan of superhero movies. In my opinion the best superhero movie released recently was X-Men First Class. Compared to that this is absolute crap, I would say.

2012-06-09,"Loud and overlong with minimal character and plot development and casual banter among the characters that feels more like a run through. Likewise, the conflict and plot don't really seem to matter, and there is no tension, suspense or pacing. Each scene is on same level as the one before; you could watch this film with the scenes arranged in virtually any order. This thing totally lacks momentum. The expensive cast does well enough, but the film's length and one-dimensional plot grows tiresome and the noisy soundtrack seems designed to prevent dozing.

The character development was good and each character was given a bit of screen time to develop the character. The action was good and not overpowering, it only added to rather than being the main part of the movie. The comic level was perfect. Not too much goofy stuff said just to try and get laughs. Every line, imo, was perfectly placed (although I'll have to see it again in order to hear some funny lines that I missed due to the laughter in the theater!). By the way, morning matinée was SOLD OUT full.

2012-04-28,"The ultimate superhero mash up from Marvel Studios.Following the huge success of Iron Man (Robert Downey Junior) and the relative healthy returns for the lesser known Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (now Mark Ruffalo) and Captain America (Chris Evans), the obvious monetary synergy of all four characters in the same movie is obvious.Adding to the mix, we have tight leather clad Black Widow (Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremey Renner) along for the ride, following their brief appearances in the previous films. On Bad guy duties we have Loki (Tom Hiddleston), hell bent on creating a portal to earth to allow his army of minions to flow through and capture the world, making him the undisputed leader of, well everything.On paper this should not really work, we have numerous superheroes all with very different powers, origin stories, character arcs and so forth. Somehow writer and director Joss Whedon, of Buffy and Serenity fame, manages to create a cohesive whole. Each character gets to contribute and have their moment or two in the sun, no-one appears sidelined for too long. The ultimate tag team if you will, even Agent Phil gets his chance to shine.Whedon is far to sharp to allow proceedings to get too pretentious, for every hint of comic book mythology a pin is on hand to puncture the balloon, audiences and characters clearly instructed not to take all this too seriously.Complaints, the film does feel long and there are shades of ""Transformers 3"" in the climactic scenes, have we not done organic alien monsters destroying skyscrapers? The story is largely irrelevant, all the crew are called together by Nick Fury (Samuel LJackson) in full, ""hell yeah"" mode, to defend the earth against this ultimate threat. Loki wields his staff with aplomb, initially stealing away Hawkeye and Selvig (Skellan Skarsgard). We know they are working for the wrong side due to their crazy eyes, until of course they experience some cognitive repair surgery, or get bashed on the head, dependent on your medical training.The effects are top notch, production values off the scale and it is obvious the director has a firm grip on the material and belief in his characters. All participants appear to be having a whole lot of fun and it comes across on the screen.Who would have thought a few years ago that cast lists of this quality would be lining up to play Comic Book heroes, how times and story lines have changed.So to the characters. Stark is just Stark, every mans wish fulfillment, rich beyond dreams, able to ignore anyone and everyone, good with the ladies but now settled with the radiant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Thor continues to talk in Nordic God like speak, which never gets old. The trusty hammer Mjolnir gets a good work out here, incidentally Natalie Portman's character is referenced but not shown on screen.Captain America is tried and true, embodying a dependable ""old world"" can do attitude, which is a pleasant antidote to Iron Man's showy pursuits. Evans does well here, actually anchoring the character somewhere firm amongst all the chaos.Strangely the character that should not work at all, just maybe steals the show. The ""Hulk"" whose character development in real life now has morphed through three ""A"" list actors, is the obvious crowd pleaser. He also gets the best two laughs in the film and the least expensive wardrobe, just a torn shirt and some cut off jeans.The Hulk is played rather well by Ruffalo, bringing something to the role that Norton or Bana did not find. The big guy remains under wraps for quite some time but when he gets angry, he sure makes some mess.Clearly the studio are thinking big, stay for the set up as it is clear the ""Avengers"" work is not done yet.Summary Yet another high for the comic book genre, post modern and self knowing in the approach, this works better than anyone might have dared to expect.Big, loud, expensive comic book superhero mashup.

It's well written, has character and plot development, stunning visual effects, fantastic action sequences, and most importantly, the avengers themselves. My favorite thing about the introduction of the characters is that they don't all appear at once. The avengers come together one at a time planning to accomplish their own goals at first, only discover that they all have a common enemy and the world needs them. It's a smart and good pace that the film follows allowing the audience to breath a little. The cast acts their parts in a way that comic book films almost never succeed in. They have dynamic and rope you in every second. You can even put aside Captain America's dorky costume because everything about this movie is so good. Best part? No romantic crap in this movie.

2012-06-13,"I like super hero movies; if well made they are lots of fun. If they are done by a Master-they are very good (The Latest Batman, the first X-men,the 1st Spider Man). I watched all of the characters in this movie in their previous solo's: enjoyed Iron Man the most (Robert Downy Jr. is one of the best actors ever); thought that Thor was very entertaining and funny (and definitely a pleasure to look at...);I enjoyed the last Hulk with E.Norton, and watched Cpt.America @ home (saved on the ticket...)and thought it was OK.We went to watch it after seeing the rating. SO: This movie is entertaining, if you like lots of CGIs and action; there is NO Original/Surprising story. The acting is good (they brought GOOD Actors, you wouldn't expect less). We laughed twice (The Hulk character provided the much needed relief). You will enjoy it on a big screen. BUT THAT'S IT. 8.6? Really? How many times you can watch Manhattan destroyed?! Time and time again in every other CGI movie.Grow up and get more original.(And Yes,AVATAR was better). I gave it a 5 to lower the expectations of people who go to watch a movie on the big screen,instead of watching it @ home.If you like CGIs and a predicted plot it deserves between 6-7. If you expect a masterpiece like THE DARK KNIGHT,-this is NOT. It's not even IRON MAN the 1st.

After only fighting for less than an hour, and they suddenly launch a Nuclear Missile? How come the Avengers were very easy to gather each other in the battlefield in a large city? (alrite, ironman can fly)And they should add ""Independence Day"" fighting to create a great massive fight against the alien.And all of the aliens are dead after the host were blown up? that was too easy..The Dark Knight were ten times better than thisBut I give this 7 out of 10 for the jokes and the acting",7.0,2012-05,Tuesday,"10:0.09, acting:0.09, after:0.26, against:0.12, alien:0.11, all:0.05, an:0.06, and:0.21, are:0.16, army:0.12, as:0.05, avengers:0.05, better:0.08, but:0.05, can:0.06, come:0.09, dark:0.11, day:0.13, each:0.08, expected:0.12, fight:0.20, fighting:0.23, for:0.09, give:0.20, great:0.13, have:0.05, hour:0.13, how:0.08, in:0.08, is:0.04, it:0.08, knight:0.11, less:0.12, like:0.06, many:0.08, movie:0.08, much:0.07, not:0.05, of:0.11, only:0.07, other:0.07, out:0.06, reviews:0.13, seems:0.12, should:0.10, story:0.07, than:0.14, that:0.04, the:0.48, they:0.12, this:0.08, times:0.11, to:0.07, too:0.16, up:0.07, very:0.07, was:0.05, watched:0.11, were:0.21, what:0.06, when:0.07, where:0.09"
2012-05-15,"Let me start by saying that I did in fact enjoy this movie. However, 8.whatever is FARRRRRRRRRR from accurate. You're meaning to tell me this ranks up there with films like The Godfather and Shawshank Redemption? Come on now.There were some really good parts. There were some almost unbelievably bad parts.(First 10-20 min. was like watching another flick entirely) Acting was up and down, but overall it wasn't bad by any means. dialogue was spotty, but had some good lines and few laughs. LOADS of CGI but the action was intense AF. So at the end of the day, it's entertaining. I couldn't watch it 5-6 times, but none the less entertaining.Now for those who can't seem to understand how ratings work. Was it the best movie you have EVER saw? No? OK, don't rate it 10/10. Was it the worst movie you have EVER saw? No? OK, don't rate it 1/10. Simple. And for those expecting some original, new, fresh plot and amazingly moving dialogue. Seriously? Go somewhere else with that sh*t. What could they have possibly done that's creative with superheros? Especially ones that have been around for 60+ years.Sorry, ranting a bit.

2012-04-30,"I had absolutely no hope of this one making it big. The second I took my seat, boy was I proved wrong by many a mile! There's a reason this is only the second super hero movie in the top 250. Coz its worth it. Period.I was absolutely glued right from the first minute. It was an awesome mixture of high-end action, drama, suspense, thrill, humor and love! OK maybe not love. Who would want that in a super hero movie anyway?Iron Man was at his brutal best whether it was tactics, word play, narcissism or just plain old explosive action. He just did not disappoint! If you thought Iron Man only did solo, you are in for a surprise.I thought Hawkeye and the Black Widow were going to be just another pair of dummies. NOT! They are as much a part of the story as the rest of them. Be prepared for some of their cool moves. Man, does Scarlett look stunning when she is beating the hell out of the bad guys. Hawkeye might have done way better with a gun, but what the hell. To each his own! Thor and Cap. America, the demigod and the strategist, with the awessssome weapon and shield combo, totally kicked butt(ask Loki's horde)! Perhaps, there was little the captain could do with just his shield.And the best for the last. For those who had lost all hopes of Hulk ever entertaining them, this one changes it all. He is now my favorite today! What raw madness (ask Loki)!! This time Hulk gives it all with a pinch of humor that we have missed in the previous two movies.The first half was built around bringing all the super-heroes together and setting up the story line without deviating from the end plot. The second half just blows you away. Joss Whedon seems to have become a master artist when it comes to super cool dudes. He's given each of the good guys an equal say in the movie with none in particular ruling the show.In the end the 2 and a half hours of non-stop fun seemed to be way less and I was left craving for more :( .

The only superhero movie that eclipses this one is Dark Knight, imo.Considering the problems we think DC is encountering, trying to cram up their heroes into one movie, the Avengers did it. FLAWLESSLY. The dialogue isn't exactly Glenn Garry Glenn Ross of course, but 99% of it keep you interested. The transitions to each scene are unbelievably fluid; the end of each scene almost always has a witty connection to the next.

2016-04-24,"It has finally happened! Marvel has done what has never been done before. It has taken numerous franchises of its comics and brought them all together on the big screen, and it was magnificent. Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, SHIELD, and Captain America have come together to form the Avengers.There was doubt about the Hulk in this movie considering the two disappointments in the previous Hulk movies. But this was the greatest Hulk in comparison to all previous Hulks. Mark Ruffalo, who plays the role of Dr. Bruce Banner, is a perfect match. He really redefined the not only Dr. Banner, but also the Hulk. Well done Marvel.The drama between the heroes as the Avengers was forming was super, but it was short lived. The fight between Iron Man and Thor was cool, but it leaves a person wanting more. Later on, the Hulk and Thor fought, and it was awesome to see it on the big screen.

2012-05-11,"By now it's probably all been said before, so I'm really just adding weight to the views on both sides of the nerd-gasm that was The Avengers.Entertainment is the name of the game here, and Whedon doesn't hold back for a minute, throwing brawling superheroes, invading aliens, and wide-scale destruction at the screen throughout its running time.Some of the character interplay, particularly between Tony Stark (Iron Man) and Bruce Banner (Hulk) are a joy to watch, with the former's acerbic put-downs (Thor is dubbed 'Point Break', and Captain America is renamed 'Rock of Ages') injecting fun into what could have otherwise been a joyless jaunt between explosions.The acting is credible overall, with Mark Ruffalo perfectly characterising Bruce Banner as the embodiment of all that the Hulk is not (awkward, reserved, quiet), Robert Downey Jnr channelling Stark's usual suave arrogance, and Tom Hiddleson's Loki permeating charm and menace in equal measure (Banner comments ""you can smell crazy on him"" at one point).These are all positives I'd been expecting from the man who wowed me with Firefly and Serenity, and my wife with Buffy.Unfortunately, there are quite a few problems as well, even for a comic book fan such as myself.Firstly, there's some seriously lumpen exposition, particularly the juvenile intro scene where the alien 'plan to invade' is bullet-pointed for the audience, in case we can't follow the basic premise. I fully expected a white board and felt markers to be used at any second. The end-credit scene is in a similar vein, and is equally cringe-worthy.A pet-hate of mine (and my wife's) is a lack of logic, and The Avengers excels in this area, with 1. The base explosion near the intro, completely unexplained, just to be accepted, 2. Loki brainwashing/controlling his 'minions' by tapping their hearts (rather than their heads, where their 'minds' are (doh!)) with his staff, and 3. Why there are numerous scenes in which the invading aliens don't open fire at the clearly exposed cops, civilians and heroes they are flying over (are they saving ammo?).Another point to consider is the absence of the National Guard. Were they off on holiday that day? By some margin, though, the greatest gripe I have with The Avengers, is the lack of genuine threat that Loki and his army poses to, not just the Avengers themselves, but to any modern army.While Loki is more than capable of taking care of Captain America (then again, who isn't?), he is quite clearly no match for Hulk, Thor or Iron Man, who each take turns in highlighting this fact. In my experience of superheroes, it's paramount to play the 'heroes' as the underdogs, who must face and overcome a challenge that, at first, seems beyond them. This is what makes for exciting (and unpredictable) entertainment.In The Avengers, there's no point at which we're under any illusion that Loki and his horde will fail, nor is there any need for concern over our heroes, since they are the overwhelming favourites to rise triumphant.All that said, I didn't feel short-changed when I left the cinema, and this is coming from someone who generally avoids Hollowood movies. Maybe some of the more abrasive critics of the movie are right - some of us are just nerdy and want to see characters with incredible powers knock the crap out of each other.Although I can understand where a rating of 8.8 has come from (over-enthusiastic fan-boys fresh from the cinema, typing up their reviews BEFORE changing their trousers), I can't add to it. The Avengers isn't Pan's Labyrinth, or Amelie, and in this context, it can't reach top spot or anywhere near it. If you're giving a movie with this numerous faults a full score, you're clearly in need of watching some genuinely well-crafted movies.It's not clever, but it is BIG!",6.0,2012-05,Friday,"acting:0.03, again:0.03, alien:0.04, all:0.06, although:0.04, america:0.05, and:0.26, another:0.04, any:0.11, are:0.18, army:0.08, as:0.07, at:0.13, audience:0.04, avengers:0.10, back:0.03, banner:0.10, be:0.04, been:0.08, before:0.07, between:0.07, big:0.03, book:0.03, both:0.04, bruce:0.07, but:0.03, by:0.07, can:0.11, captain:0.05, care:0.05, character:0.02, characters:0.02, cinema:0.08, come:0.03, comic:0.03, coming:0.04, could:0.03, day:0.05, didn:0.03, doesn:0.04, don:0.03, downey:0.03, each:0.05, end:0.03, entertainment:0.09, even:0.03, exciting:0.04, expected:0.04, experience:0.04, face:0.05, fact:0.04, fan:0.07, feel:0.03, felt:0.04, few:0.03, first:0.03, for:0.09, from:0.08, full:0.04, fun:0.03, giving:0.04, greatest:0.05, has:0.02, have:0.04, he:0.02, here:0.03, heroes:0.08, him:0.03, his:0.10, hulk:0.06, if:0.02, in:0.14, incredible:0.04, into:0.03, iron:0.04, is:0.22, isn:0.08, it:0.09, its:0.03, just:0.08, left:0.04, loki:0.12, makes:0.03, man:0.06, mark:0.03, maybe:0.04, me:0.02, more:0.04, movie:0.03, movies:0.04, must:0.03, my:0.07, need:0.08, no:0.05, not:0.05, now:0.03, of:0.23, off:0.03, on:0.06, one:0.02, or:0.07, other:0.02, our:0.04, out:0.02, over:0.09, overall:0.04, perfectly:0.04, play:0.04, point:0.16, powers:0.05, probably:0.04, put:0.04, quite:0.07, rather:0.05, rating:0.04, re:0.11, really:0.02, reviews:0.04, right:0.03, robert:0.03, ruffalo:0.03, said:0.08, scene:0.07, scenes:0.03, screen:0.03, second:0.04, see:0.02, seems:0.04, short:0.04, since:0.04, so:0.02, some:0.14, stark:0.07, such:0.03, superheroes:0.06, take:0.04, than:0.05, that:0.10, the:0.45, their:0.12, them:0.02, then:0.03, there:0.11, these:0.03, they:0.08, this:0.08, thor:0.04, though:0.03, throughout:0.04, time:0.02, to:0.15, tom:0.03, tony:0.03, top:0.04, understand:0.04, up:0.02, us:0.04, used:0.04, want:0.04, was:0.02, watch:0.03, watching:0.03, we:0.06, well:0.04, were:0.02, what:0.04, whedon:0.03, when:0.02, where:0.10, which:0.05, while:0.03, who:0.12, why:0.03, will:0.02, with:0.14, you:0.06"

The Avengers has virtually no character development or plot. It basically is non stop chase scenes and things exploding, with an extreme amount of loud noise. I don't think there were more than several quiet, dialog times the entire movie. I kept thinking that the movie would settle down and get to a meaningful story, but it did not happen. I even was watching it in 3D but that did not help. If one wants to go see continual actions stunts and things exploding, then this is the movie for you.

The film editing is a whirlwind of action, seamlessly interweaving larger-than-life battles with character-driven moments that give the narrative heart. Strengths? The seamless blending of individual hero stories into a cohesive team dynamic, a superhero jigsaw puzzle that fits together flawlessly. Weaknesses? Occasionally, the plot might hover on the edge of over-the-top, but hey, it's a superhero extravaganza, and we love it that way. The music, Alan Silvestri's score, is the pulse of heroism, swelling with each iconic entrance and saving the world crescendo. Cinematography captures the grandeur of the Marvel universe, from the soaring heights of Stark Tower to the depths of Loki's mischief. The message? A celebration of teamwork, diversity, and the idea that even the most disparate heroes can come together for the greater good. 8/10 is a superhero salute to its exhilarating entertainment, a film that not only assembles Earth's mightiest heroes but also assembles a solid spot in the pantheon of superhero epics.",8.0,2023-10,Monday,"10:0.07, action:0.04, also:0.06, and:0.12, avengers:0.04, black:0.07, but:0.07, can:0.05, cast:0.08, character:0.06, come:0.07, downey:0.07, each:0.13, earth:0.08, ensemble:0.11, entertainment:0.11, even:0.06, film:0.09, for:0.04, from:0.10, give:0.08, good:0.05, had:0.06, hero:0.16, heroes:0.13, idea:0.11, in:0.07, individual:0.11, into:0.07, is:0.13, it:0.06, its:0.07, johansson:0.08, jr:0.07, life:0.09, like:0.05, loki:0.06, love:0.08, marvel:0.10, me:0.06, might:0.10, moments:0.09, most:0.06, not:0.04, of:0.30, on:0.05, only:0.06, over:0.07, own:0.08, plot:0.07, right:0.08, robert:0.07, scarlett:0.08, stark:0.16, superhero:0.30, team:0.07, than:0.06, that:0.21, the:0.57, their:0.06, to:0.09, together:0.12, tony:0.08, top:0.09, universe:0.09, way:0.07, we:0.07, widow:0.07, with:0.08, world:0.08"

2012-05-01,"This was far from a bad film but it also wasn't quite a great film. It has spectacular CGI, is funny and each of the characters are well developed (especially The Hulk). There's even a sad emotional moment at one point. Scar Jo is actually quite cool and Loki is a bad guy who you can both sympathise and despise at the same time. I can't actually say anything is particularly bad except maybe The Hawk, I've nothing against the actor but his skills with the arrow seemed a bit out of place with the others. He was like Legolas without the blonde wig. Speaking of blonde's, you could tell the film was done by Joss Whedon as the dialogue was interspersed with quick one liners and the banter between the team was funny (the best bit though was probably when no words were used at all between Hulk and Thor). It must have been difficult to mesh all the characters together and give each of the stars enough screen time to keep them happy. Overall, it's not as good as the Dark Knight but its not meant to be as dark and serious as that, the Dark Knight is a cartoon/comic book character pretending to be a proper film star, the Avengers has film stars pretending to be cartoon/comic book characters and it never takes itself too seriously so is fun to watch.",7.0,2012-05,Tuesday,"actor:0.08, actually:0.14, against:0.08, all:0.06, also:0.05, and:0.19, anything:0.07, are:0.04, as:0.16, at:0.12, avengers:0.03, bad:0.19, be:0.11, been:0.05, best:0.04, between:0.13, bit:0.14, book:0.12, both:0.07, but:0.09, by:0.04, can:0.09, cgi:0.07, character:0.05, characters:0.12, comic:0.10, cool:0.08, could:0.05, dark:0.21, dialogue:0.08, done:0.06, each:0.10, enough:0.07, especially:0.07, even:0.05, far:0.07, film:0.19, from:0.04, fun:0.06, funny:0.13, give:0.06, good:0.04, great:0.04, guy:0.07, has:0.08, have:0.03, he:0.04, his:0.05, hulk:0.08, is:0.15, it:0.12, its:0.05, itself:0.08, joss:0.05, keep:0.08, knight:0.15, like:0.04, loki:0.05, maybe:0.08, moment:0.08, must:0.07, never:0.06, no:0.05, not:0.07, nothing:0.07, of:0.10, one:0.07, others:0.08, out:0.04, overall:0.07, place:0.08, point:0.08, probably:0.07, quite:0.14, same:0.07, say:0.06, screen:0.06, seemed:0.09, serious:0.09, so:0.04, spectacular:0.09, star:0.08, stars:0.17, takes:0.08, team:0.06, that:0.03, the:0.40, them:0.05, there:0.04, this:0.03, thor:0.04, though:0.07, time:0.08, to:0.14, together:0.05, too:0.05, used:0.08, ve:0.06, was:0.19, wasn:0.08, watch:0.05, well:0.04, were:0.05, whedon:0.05, when:0.05, who:0.05, with:0.09, without:0.07, you:0.07"

2012-05-23,"So i finally got to see this earlier today after weeks of hearing about how great it is and how its breaking box office records... blah blah blah. I watched the trailer (several times) and thought it looked like 'fun', then it opened and people were saying how much of a 'great film' it actually is - so my interest started to grow from 'will watch it at some point' to 'i need to see what the fuss is about' - and thats what i did this morning.All the characters work out great, especially the sparring relationship between Thor and The Hulk, as well the bickering between Captain America and Iron Man.Direction wise... meh... by the numbers with a budget this big and the resources available with that sort of money. However it's the films script that really shines. So tightly written there's no throw-away dialogue.I think what people have gotten so excited about is the 'eye candy' over anything else and this film is beautiful to look at - but looks fade very quickly and this will soon be added to the pile of CGI heavy films that look kinda dated and hammy compared to the 'next big thing' Overall. Nice to look and a great script, but lacks the weight and enduring impact it should have. I understand Iron Man 3 comes out next year and that will no doubt eclipse the memory of this.

2023-03-13,"""The Avengers"" is a 2012 adventure/action film directed by Joss Whedon and starring an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man, Chris Evans as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. The movie follows these superheroes as they come together to save the world from an alien invasion led by the villainous Loki (Tom Hiddleston).One of the strongest aspects of the movie is the chemistry between the cast. Each actor brings their own unique take on their character, and their interactions with one another are both humorous and engaging. The film's action scenes are also impressive, with a mix of practical and digital effects used to create thrilling set pieces.The plot is well-crafted and engaging, with a good balance between action, character development, and humor. The movie does a great job of juggling its large ensemble cast, giving each character their own moment to shine while also moving the overall plot forward.The direction by Whedon is confident and assured, with a strong visual style and a keen sense of pacing. The cinematography by Seamus McGarvey is also impressive, with a mix of handheld shots and steady compositions that give the film a sense of energy and momentum.The musical score by Alan Silvestri is a standout, with a memorable main theme and well-placed motifs that help to elevate the film's emotional moments.However, the film's villain, Loki, can feel somewhat underdeveloped at times. While Tom Hiddleston brings a sense of charisma and wit to the role, the character's motivations and backstory are not always clear, making him a somewhat one-dimensional antagonist.Overall, ""The Avengers"" is an entertaining adventure/action movie that succeeds in bringing together some of Marvel's most beloved characters on the big screen. With strong performances, impressive action scenes, and a well-crafted plot, it is a highlight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a must-see for fans of the franchise.",9.0,2023-03,Monday,"2012:0.06, action:0.14, actor:0.06, alien:0.06, also:0.11, always:0.05, america:0.03, an:0.09, and:0.29, another:0.05, are:0.08, as:0.18, at:0.03, avengers:0.05, between:0.10, big:0.04, black:0.04, both:0.06, brings:0.13, by:0.16, can:0.03, captain:0.03, cast:0.14, character:0.14, characters:0.03, chris:0.10, cinematic:0.06, come:0.05, development:0.06, does:0.04, downey:0.04, each:0.08, effects:0.04, ensemble:0.13, entertaining:0.05, evans:0.05, fans:0.05, feel:0.05, film:0.14, for:0.02, franchise:0.07, from:0.03, give:0.05, giving:0.07, good:0.03, great:0.03, hawkeye:0.04, help:0.07, hemsworth:0.05, hiddleston:0.10, him:0.05, however:0.05, hulk:0.03, humor:0.05, impressive:0.21, in:0.02, iron:0.03, is:0.16, it:0.02, its:0.04, jeremy:0.05, job:0.05, johansson:0.05, joss:0.04, jr:0.04, loki:0.07, main:0.06, making:0.06, man:0.03, mark:0.04, marvel:0.06, moment:0.06, moments:0.05, most:0.04, movie:0.08, must:0.05, not:0.03, of:0.20, on:0.06, one:0.08, overall:0.11, own:0.10, performances:0.06, plot:0.13, renner:0.05, robert:0.04, role:0.06, ruffalo:0.04, save:0.06, scarlett:0.05, scenes:0.08, screen:0.04, see:0.03, sense:0.18, set:0.06, some:0.03, superheroes:0.04, take:0.05, that:0.09, the:0.43, their:0.14, these:0.04, they:0.03, thor:0.03, times:0.05, to:0.09, together:0.07, tom:0.10, universe:0.06, used:0.06, villain:0.05, visual:0.06, well:0.10, whedon:0.08, while:0.10, widow:0.04, with:0.16, world:0.05"
2012-05-19,"Overall, this film delivers and this compliment comes from a Marvel fan. Though each individual hero remains true to character from their singular franchise, the film is nearly a live action cartoon. There is a humanism that live action brings to screen that animation lacks; It's called emotion, and Marvel's ""Avengers"" noticeably void of it. Regardless of that critique, no one goes for these types of films for ultra realism, but more so for the production value. Great action choreography, Johanssen is terribly hot in black leather, plenty of explosions and the Hulk does what he does best: ""SMASH"". The idea of some of my favorite hero's banding together, overcoming inter personal differences during a time of dire need and ultimately saving the day left me satisfied. This one is a must see and I recommend paying the extra to watch it in 3D. BTW, don't forget to hang around until the FULL EXTENT of the credits have passed.

2019-04-26,"And that is all mostly due to all the previous ground work laid out by Marvel Studios. Pay attention, Warner Bros!!. This is how it's done!! . In order for this to work, some character development has to be put into place in the form of stand-alone movies giving the chance to each and every one of the team's member characters to shine and for us, the audience, to get to know them. Whether all these stand-alone movies have been up to snuff or not, is irrelevant. What it is relevant, is that the audience has had a chance to know them and therefore, care about what happens to them. And in that, this movie excells.

2023-09-02,"Probably the most important blockbuster of the 21st century so far. This generation's Star Wars (1977). A cultural landmark that proved individual stories serving a unifying purpose can be told within a cinematic universe, a feat that many studios have tried to replicate but failed, and something that the MCU struggles with today.The biggest challenge that The Avengers (2012) would face is having to balance the immense stardom that comes with the previous five films, which all lead up to this moment. A moment that would make or break the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the moment when six individual and leading multi-layered superhero characters would share the silver screen together for the first time.What makes this film work so well is Joss Whedon's screenplay, a highlight of the film that respects and values each character, their motivations, and their overall arcs. Even all the jokes, iconic lines, and quips feel organic and true to each persona. The lab scene where all the main characters present argue and clash over different things beautifully captures the perfect synergy between the different characters. It's my favourite scene in the film and probably the most well-written one in the MCU, which establishes so much in so little time.From a technical aspect, the visual effects are still as remarkable as they were ten years ago when I first saw the film. Hulk's design is drastically improved from his stand-alone feature and is my favourite incarnation of the character in the MCU. Stark's suits always look incredible and it's a shame that in Infinity War and Endgame, they are less practical and just worse. Captain America's suit is goofy as hell, and overall, the other visuals or designs do not stand out, but the film does choose to take a safe, bright, well-light approach to its cinematography and aesthetic, instead of a specific look.There's nothing I don't like about the film, and there's undoubtedly a lot of nostalgia packed into it at this point, but it always feels fresh and exciting whenever I see any scene. The one shot during the battle of New York is one of the most glorious comic book film moments ever.

2023-04-13,"The Avengers is a movie that has been in the making for the years that have come and gone. After finally making its worldwide debut, it paid off in a big way and helped make not only cinematic history for itself, but for the MCU itself for what was to come. After Loki comes to Earth to steal the Tesseract to open a portal from space that will release a alien army, Nick Fury has no options than to finally launched the long awaited avengers initiative to save humanity as we know it. Robert Downey Jr returns once again as Iron Man to help put the avengers initiative into full motion. Chris Evans returns as well as Captain America after being frozen in ice for decades who is still trying to adjust to the new and improved world to also help recover the Tesseract. Chris Hemsworth returns as Thor to help bring a end to Loki's terror on Earth and bring him home. Mark Ruffalo takes over from Edward Norton's Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk and I much like his portrayal a bit better than Edward Norton's just, because I feel like he captures Banners/Hulks likeness a little bit better like it should be. Scarlett Johansson returns as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow to save Clint Barton/Hawkeye played by Jeremy Renner who is under a type of hypnosis by Loki's control and bring him back to fight on the avengers side. Tom Hiddleston is more menacing and terrifying than ever as Loki, making his performance in this one of my favorite villains in the MCU. This film is full of action, thrills, comedy, and sci-fi that will keep you the edge of your seat all the way until the end.

2012-08-21,"It is quite unfortunate that after Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, the Marvel films switched from being serious films to complete jokes. I was expecting ""The Avengers"" to be a really bad film. However, instead of being painful to watch like Iron Man 2, Captain America, and Thor, ""The Avengers"" is really entertaining as a whole.It is certainly an interesting film. It is sort of like the movie Machete, except much better. It has a B-movie feel to it, but is extremely entertaining. The villain is so cliché, it is hysterical. Part of what really makes this movie shine is the horrible acting and dialogue by several of the actors and actresses. The three worst actors in the movie are Loki (the villain played by Tom Hiddleston), Nick Fury (played by Samuel Jackson), and Agent Maria Hill (played by Colbie Smulders).While the idea of watching a movie with horrible dialogue may not be appealing to some, there is another side to the movie that works well in an admirable fashion. And that is the super heroes, particularly Iron Man, The Hulk, and Captain America. These actors really add some emotion and movie star pizazz to the movie in the same way that Liam Neeson did for The Phantom Menace (which is probably the worst movie of all time). The effects and action scenes are all top notch. Though some of the action scenes with the Black Cat and Hawkeye are a little unconvincing considering they are just normal humans with no super powers or technology.Nonetheless, it is fun to also see Robert Downey Jr. make fun of the campiness and unbelievable other Avengers.",7.0,2012-08,Tuesday,"acting:0.06, action:0.06, actors:0.17, after:0.05, agent:0.08, all:0.05, also:0.04, america:0.08, an:0.07, and:0.23, another:0.06, are:0.13, as:0.03, avengers:0.09, bad:0.06, be:0.06, being:0.10, better:0.05, black:0.05, but:0.03, by:0.15, captain:0.08, certainly:0.08, dialogue:0.14, did:0.05, downey:0.05, effects:0.05, entertaining:0.12, feel:0.06, film:0.07, films:0.10, for:0.03, from:0.03, fun:0.10, fury:0.05, has:0.04, hawkeye:0.05, heroes:0.05, hiddleston:0.06, however:0.06, hulk:0.07, idea:0.08, in:0.07, incredible:0.06, instead:0.08, interesting:0.07, iron:0.11, is:0.27, it:0.16, jackson:0.06, jr:0.05, just:0.03, like:0.07, little:0.06, loki:0.04, make:0.05, makes:0.05, man:0.11, marvel:0.04, may:0.07, movie:0.22, much:0.04, nick:0.05, no:0.04, not:0.03, of:0.17, or:0.04, other:0.04, part:0.06, played:0.20, powers:0.08, probably:0.07, quite:0.06, really:0.16, robert:0.05, same:0.06, samuel:0.06, scenes:0.09, see:0.04, serious:0.08, so:0.03, some:0.12, star:0.07, super:0.11, that:0.10, the:0.46, there:0.04, these:0.05, they:0.03, this:0.02, thor:0.04, though:0.06, time:0.04, to:0.17, tom:0.06, top:0.06, villain:0.11, was:0.03, watch:0.04, watching:0.06, way:0.05, well:0.04, what:0.04, which:0.04, while:0.06, whole:0.06, with:0.08"

2012-04-28,"Since the dawn of men, we aspired to be heroes. We told each other stories of strong and smart men who fought in legendary battles, stood against fearsome beasts and saved beautiful damsels in distress. Since the 20s of the last century, some people have been writing such stories down in the form of comic books and graphic novels. Two of the people who did this were Stan Lee and Jack Kirby at Marvel Comics. The created among others the rich genius in a flying suit called Iron Man, the super soldier called Captain America, a new version of thunder god Thor, two spies under the names Black Widow and Hawkeye and of course the man that turns into a big, green, angry monster which calls itself Hulk. Comics like this were made into movies, but nearly all of them had some flaws. They weren't like the comics, took themselves to serious, made to much jokes or had some other flaws. Now a pretty unknown director takes a few famous heroes of Marvel (see above) and makes a movie with them with does no mistakes the other movies made. The story itself is about heroes with flaws, who need to grow together as a team so they can save the world from a mighty attack from other world.

I've never seen Thor or Captain America so I know I'm missing a little backstory, but I doubt it would add a lot to the experience in this movie. The story was sub-par and very predictable. There is also no sense of danger whatsoever since these superheroes are near invincible, which is why I tend to avoid superhero movies. Action scenes are therefore boring because you know the outcome 99/100 times. I laugh at why they even bother shooting guns at these guys. Do they really expect us to be on the edge of our seats? Yes, the visuals are decent but that's not what makes a movie. When comparing this film to Guardians of the Galaxy, it's no contest. GotG had drama, humor (that wasn't forced), a decent story, and fantastic visuals. If you are a Marvel fan, you will probably like this film simply because you love the characters.

It's not a big shocker that the film is loud, bombastic and only marginally coherent. It also happens to be exciting, funny and self aware enough to know just how seriously to treat the material. The result may not be one of the best action films ever made, but it's probably one of the better ones to be released in recent years.The boys in this movie -- Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Liam Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner -- are clearly meant to own the show, but it's Scarlett Johannsson who steals it.Grade: B+",7.0,2013-03,Sunday,"action:0.13, all:0.06, also:0.09, and:0.13, are:0.07, be:0.20, been:0.09, best:0.08, better:0.10, big:0.10, brings:0.15, but:0.11, chris:0.12, downey:0.10, enough:0.12, evans:0.12, ever:0.10, every:0.11, exciting:0.16, fan:0.12, film:0.07, films:0.20, funny:0.12, has:0.08, have:0.06, hemsworth:0.12, how:0.10, in:0.20, is:0.05, it:0.23, jeremy:0.13, jr:0.10, just:0.07, know:0.11, made:0.10, mark:0.10, marvel:0.08, may:0.14, movie:0.10, not:0.12, of:0.13, one:0.13, only:0.09, own:0.24, probably:0.14, renner:0.13, robert:0.10, ruffalo:0.10, scarlett:0.12, show:0.14, that:0.16, the:0.34, their:0.08, this:0.09, to:0.23, together:0.09, who:0.09, years:0.12"
2019-03-14,"The Avengers was awesome. It should not have been. There were so many characters that writing a coherent screenplay and doing each character justice should have been impossible. But nevertheless, Joss Whedon managed to write an awesome screenplay.
My only flaw, because let's get it out of the way, was that the first act was slightly slow. But it needed to be slow to give the characters motivations, and bring them together convincingly. I was also surprised at how funny the movie actually was.
All the character, be it Iron Man or Black Widow, we're given sufficient screen time. Nobody look out of their depth. Everyone was in the movie for a reason, and in the final battle, all the characters proved to be useful.
Also, this movie gave us the best version of the Hulk. Technically, the movie was flawless.
Marvel has always suffered with it's villains. I am happy to say that Loki is one of the best villains ever. He was manipulative, cunning and charming at the same time.
Before this movie, so many superheroes coming together seemed like a dream. Marvel was betting everything on this movie. And this movie succeeded. It has changed Hollywood forever.

2012-05-06,"Yeah...it is an action packed flick from beginning to end. The interweaving of all the Marvel characters was done in a coherent way and I truly feel as though I got my money's worth out of it. Samuel L. Jackson is an amazing actor and if you think about all the roles he's executed so well, it boggles the mind. This is not to diminish the performances of all the other names who appear in this film. Robert Downey, by far, has the best lines and his delivery is always spot on. The CGI effects are great, flawless and awesome. Plot, screenplay and performances...grade B. I was a big fan of Marvel as a kid and the whole package stays true to the printed genre. Mark Ruffalo was a good pick for the latest Hulk incarnation. Gweneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johansson turn in fine performances and look hhhhotttt!............ I know that it's just a movie, one must suspend reality and have buy-in, and I don't want to be hypercritical but.....1) I would expect that Hulk & Thor would be uninjured in their battles and even Ironman has his suit to protect him...but the other three characters, after all, are really just HUMAN, right? Though enhanced human in some way, shape or form, they just aren't in the same class of ""super"" hero as the previously mentioned three. In fact, they aren't ""super"" at all. I would think that each of them, in succession, would have been squashed by something thrown at them by one of the warriors from another planet. 2) The ""suiting-up"" process for Ironman is starting to become a little silly and I didn't like the shape change of the power plant in the middle of his chest from a circle to a triangle. 3) The Hulk goes from a mindless...well...HULK, to a character who then helps ""the team""...pick pick pick......After you see it I'm sure you'll agree that this movie is definitely NOT an 8.8 as movies go...but the ratings system at this venue has ALWAYS been flawed. If you don't read too much into it, it's pretty solid entertainment especially if you're an action fan, Marvel fan, or a fan of any of the actors involved and worth seeing on the big screen ....especially because the sound systems seem to have been upgraded in recent times...........but I wouldn't pay more than matinée price.P.S.....there is an additional ""snippet"" of movie inserted into the credit roll so don't exit too quickly......The only thing that really ticked me off was the $7. price tag for a MEDIUM popcorn !?....get real, people........... .

2013-06-11,"Take a dozen writers and a dozen directors. Keep each in the dark. Refuse to allow any of them to talk to one another. Then have an intern collate all the scripts and hand a part of the script to each director. After each director has shot his or her portion, hand those portions to other interns and have them splice it together to make a film and try to convince the public that it is a unified film. It has too many story lines with far too much going on. I was almost cheering for the villains to win as I cared nothing for any of the heroes, and yes, I understand the concept of the flawed Marvel hero. It dragged more than Ru Paul and had more holes than Swiss Cheese. I could almost predict the dialog and the plot turning points. Dull, dull, dull.

It has made over 1.5 billion dollars, and it has received high praise from both fans and critics. And the success of this movie is very well deserved! The really great thing about this movie doesn't come from all the action, humor or visual effects... It is to see all these characters interact with each other in one room! Joss Whedon truly was the man for the job, and he impresses once again with his ability to portray each character as meaningful as the other. Everybody counts! There isn't one hero, but six of them! And they are all relevant and meaningful, plus all their character development is superb... All of them! Whedon has my full respect! The visual effects in this movie are out of this world! It really is spectacular and a joy to watch! The cinematography is likewise beautiful in this movie! But in the technical department all my praise and full respect goes to Alan Silvestri! His score for this movie blew me away! Especially, the ""Avengers Assemble"" tune! No gripes from me in the technical department!As for the cast they are all terrific! Robert Downey Jr. is easily my favorite and probably the funniest in this movie! Mark Ruffalo makes the best Bruce Banner aka ""The Hulk"" to date, with a serious and human, yet comedic performance! Chris Evans is still quite good as Captain America. As far as performances go, this guy is probably the weakest. But he's still an awesome actor! Chris Hemsworth isn't a remarkable actor either, but he has nice charisma and fits the role as Thor! Scarlett Johansson is smoking hot and sexy, and much more relevant than she was in Iron Man 2!

2019-06-14,"How is that this movie is so good even after masterpieces of phase three? I re-watched it two times in a row (which makes it a total of 6) and still loved every moment of it. If I have to guess it's the amazing chemistry between the actors and a great writing (unlike awful Game of Thrones,season 8), which makes it tick. There are no grade A actors in it , aside perhaps Robert Downy Jr. and Sam L Jackson, yet in this one, every one is a star. Both Evans and Hemsworth embrace their role to perfection and aren't just a pretty face. They are captain America and Thor respectively, and I cant' imagine anyone else in that role. A typical acting of Mark Ruffalo, actually works perfectly and one might say that he did his difficult role of Hulk even better than Ed Norton, whom I personally consider to be one of the best, though notoriously known difficult to work with, actors. Scarlet Johanson Gave a superb performance and for me this is one of her best movies ever. Not to forget everyone else, who gave an outstanding performance. This movie is not without its flaws, yet the sheer enjoyment and inspiration it provides, makes up for it. I will give it a 10/10 rating, as this is a movie that started an Avengers craze for me, so all the other movies, even the bad ones, fall into their place in this epic movie series.",10.0,2019-06,Friday,"10:0.13, acting:0.07, actors:0.21, actually:0.07, after:0.06, all:0.03, amazing:0.06, america:0.05, an:0.09, and:0.25, anyone:0.09, are:0.08, as:0.04, avengers:0.04, bad:0.07, be:0.04, best:0.10, better:0.06, between:0.07, both:0.08, captain:0.05, did:0.06, else:0.17, epic:0.08, evans:0.07, even:0.15, ever:0.06, every:0.12, everyone:0.07, face:0.10, for:0.10, give:0.07, good:0.04, great:0.04, have:0.04, he:0.05, hemsworth:0.07, her:0.09, his:0.05, how:0.06, hulk:0.04, if:0.05, in:0.14, into:0.06, is:0.16, it:0.24, its:0.06, jackson:0.07, jr:0.06, just:0.04, loved:0.08, makes:0.20, mark:0.06, me:0.10, might:0.09, moment:0.09, movie:0.12, movies:0.09, no:0.05, norton:0.09, not:0.07, of:0.21, one:0.18, other:0.05, perfectly:0.09, performance:0.17, place:0.09, pretty:0.07, rating:0.09, re:0.08, robert:0.06, role:0.24, ruffalo:0.06, say:0.06, series:0.09, so:0.08, star:0.08, still:0.06, than:0.05, that:0.12, the:0.15, their:0.10, there:0.04, they:0.04, this:0.16, thor:0.05, though:0.07, times:0.08, to:0.13, two:0.07, up:0.05, watched:0.08, which:0.11, who:0.05, will:0.05, with:0.03, without:0.07, work:0.07, writing:0.09, yet:0.16"
2017-05-23,"'The Avengers' was directed by Joss Whedon and stars Roberty Downey Jr, Chris Evans and Tom Hiddlesticks(Hiddleston if it actually bothers you). It's the end result of 5 previous movies, combined into one awesome spectacular entry to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. When a charming, likable British villain tries to attack Earth with his giant disposable CGI space army forcing some mentor like figure to form a super team, consisting of the protagonists from 5 completely separate movies rolled into one. And thus we have a Cinematic Universe. Thanks Feige. Your brilliance had doomed us all. The Avengers is one of the most likable, enjoyable, fun action/superhero movies that's ever been released and redefined a genre. Without this movie, all the cinematic universes we have today wouldn't exist(the debate on whether that's good or not is still open) and a superhero movie on this scale would have been attempted. Don't watch this movie expecting 'The Dark Knight' or 'X-Men' because this movie centres fun as its #1 goal and excels at it. All the cast is likable, the action is fun and it is overall just a great, big fun way to spend 2 hours of you life.As much as I praise this movie, it does have some flaws. The main flaw is the dull, generic and cliché ridden story which is just really poorly written. It follows the tropes way too closely and began the trend to have NO stakes in Marvel movies. I will also say the 'ending' should have had more of an impact and felt more important than it was so I would definitely say it should have been handled better. The end credits sequences are gold, though.Robert Downey Jr is excellent as Iron Man and is easily the best part of the MCU. On the flip side of this, I will say that I was very disappointed in Chris Evan's Captain America and I think his blatant lack of emotion and all times is unsettling and boring to watch. I understand the need of a straight man to keep the group in check but he was more like a robot than a human. Hiddlesticks was phenomenal as Loki and remains as easily the best MCU villain. He's smart, he's charming and, most importantly, he's British. That must be a requirement on entry to the 'Super villain Squad' because every villain in the universe is British(or at least the good ones are). Scarlett Johanson was good as Black Widow and you can see genuine emotion between her and Hawkeye. She may not be a critical member of the team but she's a female and yay for diversity. Mark Ruffallo was great as Bruce Banner and I adore how he refers to his alter ego as 'the other guy'. Jeremy Renner was fine as Hawkeye and remains the most useful Avenger with his SICK Archery Skills. Seriously though, he doesn't need to exist. Chris Hemsworth was good as Thor but not particularly memorable. Samuel Jackson is great as Nick Fury and a 15 rated movie of him would be comedy gold.The cinematography for this movie is great and I adore the tracking shots Whedon uses in the action and I think it benefits the action so much. Whedon CAN do action supremely well. The effects are amazing and are a delight to look at. The costume design was great and the set design was also really good. This movie needed to provide some fun action sequences, be funny and bring one of the most iconic superhero teams to the big screen without getting crucified by die hard Marvel fans. I can speak for two of them factors and say it achieved them. As for the third one, I can't comment but I will assume they were happy. In conclusion, this is undoubtedly one of the best comic book movies of all time and is just great fun to watch. If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend you do because it is pure, adrenaline filled enjoyment.9/10",9.0,2017-05,Tuesday,"10:0.03, action:0.10, actually:0.03, all:0.07, also:0.05, amazing:0.03, america:0.02, an:0.02, and:0.33, are:0.07, army:0.04, as:0.21, at:0.06, avenger:0.04, avengers:0.03, awesome:0.03, banner:0.03, be:0.07, because:0.08, been:0.07, best:0.06, better:0.03, between:0.03, big:0.05, black:0.03, book:0.03, boring:0.04, bring:0.04, bruce:0.03, but:0.06, by:0.04, can:0.08, captain:0.02, cast:0.03, cgi:0.03, chris:0.09, cinematic:0.12, comedy:0.04, comic:0.02, credits:0.04, dark:0.03, definitely:0.04, disappointed:0.04, do:0.05, does:0.03, doesn:0.03, don:0.02, downey:0.05, earth:0.03, effects:0.02, end:0.06, evans:0.03, ever:0.03, every:0.03, excellent:0.04, fans:0.03, felt:0.04, for:0.06, from:0.02, fun:0.17, funny:0.03, fury:0.03, genre:0.04, getting:0.04, good:0.10, great:0.12, group:0.04, guy:0.04, had:0.05, hard:0.04, have:0.12, haven:0.04, hawkeye:0.05, he:0.13, hemsworth:0.03, her:0.04, hiddleston:0.03, highly:0.04, him:0.03, his:0.09, hours:0.04, how:0.02, if:0.04, in:0.08, into:0.05, iron:0.02, is:0.19, it:0.13, its:0.03, jackson:0.03, jeremy:0.03, joss:0.02, jr:0.05, just:0.06, keep:0.04, knight:0.04, least:0.04, life:0.03, like:0.04, loki:0.02, look:0.04, main:0.04, man:0.04, mark:0.03, marvel:0.06, may:0.04, mcu:0.08, more:0.06, most:0.10, movie:0.12, movies:0.10, much:0.05, must:0.03, need:0.07, nick:0.03, no:0.02, not:0.05, of:0.17, on:0.07, one:0.10, or:0.06, other:0.02, overall:0.03, part:0.03, previous:0.03, really:0.04, recommend:0.04, renner:0.03, robert:0.03, samuel:0.03, say:0.11, scarlett:0.03, screen:0.03, see:0.02, seen:0.03, sequences:0.07, set:0.04, she:0.08, should:0.06, so:0.04, some:0.06, spectacular:0.04, stars:0.04, still:0.03, story:0.02, super:0.06, superhero:0.07, team:0.05, than:0.05, that:0.05, the:0.43, them:0.05, they:0.02, think:0.05, this:0.12, thor:0.02, though:0.06, time:0.02, times:0.03, to:0.16, tom:0.03, too:0.03, two:0.03, understand:0.04, universe:0.11, us:0.04, very:0.02, villain:0.12, was:0.16, watch:0.07, way:0.05, we:0.05, well:0.02, were:0.02, whedon:0.07, when:0.02, which:0.02, widow:0.03, will:0.06, with:0.03, without:0.06, would:0.07, written:0.04, you:0.08, your:0.03"

2019-04-10,"Even if the movie, the story, wasn't that great, this movie changed cinema (for better or worse), creating a path to serialized ""event"" movies, all ""important"" to have the whole picture of the insane 23 movies arc of the Avengers. Without this movie being this fun, well paced and put together, we wouldn't have the MCU.And it pretty much delivered on what it promised. Without the need to introduce the main characters, the movie ditched the typical structure and started with a bang to never slow down, really. With action from the start, connecting every single character already presented (the six heroes, their recruiter, the villain). The movie assumed we all knew the characters because we saw the other movies (making them literally a ""must watch"" to savior all the details and enhance the experience), which was the best decision ever. They didn't follow the rules (they created their own, which will be become stalled later) and made the best possible ensemble movie.But it wasn't just pure action, because with Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, they started (and would continue in the next movies) their philosophical (lightly philosophical, but still) exploration of war against an exterior threat. And they still managed to give the others moments to shine (if not really arcs of their own). Thor and Hulk with their powers; Black Widow's smart spy mind; Fury's uniting the team, etc.The action is insane and the CGI ridiculously perfect. Loki is perfect for a first villain and the dialogue is funny with the needed exposition done well.Having said all that, the second act could be better and parts a bit too childish or just stupid (Loki vs. Hulk; Hulk ""I'm always angry""; Hulk vs. Thor).

2023-04-06,"The Avengers, directed by Joss Whedon, is a superhero blockbuster that brought together some of the most popular Marvel characters, including Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and the Hulk, to save the world from an alien invasion. The movie was a box-office success, grossing over $1.5 billion worldwide, and was widely acclaimed for its impressive visuals, thrilling action scenes, and witty humor.The plot of the movie revolves around the Tesseract, an energy source that is coveted by Thor's evil brother, Loki, who is determined to use it to conquer Earth. To stop him, Nick Fury, the director of S. H. I. E. L. D, assembles a team of superheroes, each with their own unique powers and personalities, to form the Avengers. The movie is packed with action, drama, and humor, as the Avengers must overcome their differences and work together to save the world from total destruction.One of the strengths of The Avengers is its talented ensemble cast, who brought their characters to life with impressive performances. Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man is a standout, delivering hilarious one-liners and perfectly capturing the arrogance and charm of Tony Stark. Chris Evans as Captain America and Chris Hemsworth as Thor also shine, bringing gravitas and humanity to their roles. Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk is a surprising highlight, delivering a nuanced and emotional performance as the scientist struggling to control his monstrous alter-ego.The cinematography and visual effects in The Avengers are also top-notch, with stunning set-pieces and thrilling action sequences that are a feast for the eyes. The climactic battle in New York City, where the Avengers face off against the invading alien army, is particularly impressive, with Whedon expertly balancing the various characters and their powers.However, the movie is not without its flaws. Some critics have criticized the plot for being formulaic and predictable, and the character development is somewhat lacking, with most of the Avengers already having been introduced in previous movies. Additionally, the female characters, such as Black Widow and Maria Hill, are somewhat sidelined and do not have as much agency as their male counterparts.Despite these criticisms, The Avengers remains a highly entertaining and enjoyable movie that successfully combines humor, action, and drama. Its witty humor, impressive visuals, and talented cast make it a must-see for any Marvel fan, and its success paved the way for the even more ambitious Avengers movies that followed.",7.0,2023-04,Thursday,"action:0.09, against:0.05, alien:0.10, already:0.05, also:0.07, america:0.06, an:0.05, and:0.34, any:0.04, are:0.07, army:0.05, around:0.05, as:0.20, avengers:0.20, battle:0.04, been:0.03, being:0.04, black:0.03, blockbuster:0.05, brother:0.05, brought:0.11, by:0.06, captain:0.06, cast:0.08, character:0.03, characters:0.10, chris:0.08, development:0.05, director:0.04, do:0.04, downey:0.03, each:0.03, earth:0.04, effects:0.03, ensemble:0.06, entertaining:0.04, evans:0.04, even:0.03, evil:0.05, face:0.06, fan:0.04, for:0.10, from:0.05, fury:0.04, have:0.04, having:0.05, hemsworth:0.04, highly:0.05, him:0.04, his:0.03, however:0.05, hulk:0.05, humor:0.17, impressive:0.24, in:0.05, iron:0.05, is:0.17, it:0.03, its:0.17, joss:0.03, jr:0.04, life:0.05, loki:0.03, make:0.03, man:0.05, mark:0.04, marvel:0.05, more:0.03, most:0.07, movie:0.09, movies:0.05, much:0.03, must:0.09, new:0.04, nick:0.04, not:0.04, of:0.13, off:0.04, one:0.04, over:0.04, own:0.04, packed:0.05, perfectly:0.05, performance:0.05, performances:0.05, plot:0.07, powers:0.11, previous:0.05, robert:0.03, ruffalo:0.04, save:0.11, scenes:0.03, see:0.03, sequences:0.05, set:0.05, some:0.06, stark:0.04, stop:0.05, such:0.04, superhero:0.03, superheroes:0.04, team:0.04, tesseract:0.06, that:0.09, the:0.49, their:0.18, these:0.04, thor:0.08, to:0.14, together:0.06, tony:0.04, top:0.05, visual:0.05, was:0.04, way:0.03, whedon:0.07, where:0.04, who:0.06, widow:0.03, with:0.12, without:0.04, witty:0.11, work:0.04, world:0.08, york:0.05"
2017-06-06,"This is an example of a successful movie. The successful movie is when you watch it breathtaking, easy watching and yet this is a movie very hard to make.The hell of making such a movie is to write a handful of protagonists - each having a separate movie of their own - into a single movie, where all of them should be main characters and equally. A hell of a job)) Yet of all Avengers movies, including Civil War, this one is the best. So.. this is one of the movies you wish it never ends) But first.. I want to praise the role of Cobie Smulders. She is very sexy and played her role of Maria Hill very and very sexy) I'd very much like to have such a girlfriend in me life)) So) The task was to make many episodes like video clips)) where each of the characters have single and impressive dialogue and acting. Then - to unite them all into a movie. Personally, after watching it three times.. I'm a big fan of Scarlett so first time I was all into her.. Second time I watched it I liked the performance of Tom Hiddleston, well.. this is a movie where all actors are just perfect))Tom .. there is something ideal for him to take the role of Loki.. you will never see him as a villain)) You will understand him and have compassion - this is what Marvel is all about)) But today.. as I watched it the third time.. it was all about the connection. about understanding, about to be together. Strange but this third time, I noticed the trust Captain America tried to have to this team, strange and unknown to him.. Sacrifice Iron Man made.. their mutual partnership.. you know.. Marvel's movies are not about fun comics blockbuster they have a meaning) This movie was about understanding and to be together despite all odds) A dialogue between so different people and about not to be alone but to be together)) This is why I love Marvel movies so much) They have this humanity in it)) Beauty of humanity in all of the rage of a blockbuster))So today.. it is about Thor still loving his half brother, Widow saving Arrow, Iron man and Captain working together.. Hulk.. trying so much to be a good man he always is.. This is not thanks God just a superhero movie this a movie about understanding and God! it ends too soon - the movie))Thank you Marvel) It is marvel)) The fairy tale not about heroes but about us))",10.0,2017-06,Tuesday,"about:0.32, acting:0.04, actors:0.04, after:0.04, all:0.17, always:0.04, america:0.03, an:0.03, and:0.18, are:0.04, as:0.04, avengers:0.02, be:0.13, best:0.03, between:0.04, big:0.04, blockbuster:0.10, brother:0.05, but:0.09, captain:0.06, characters:0.05, comics:0.04, dialogue:0.10, different:0.04, each:0.07, fan:0.04, first:0.06, for:0.02, fun:0.04, god:0.09, good:0.03, half:0.05, hard:0.05, have:0.13, having:0.05, he:0.03, her:0.10, heroes:0.03, hiddleston:0.04, him:0.16, his:0.03, hulk:0.02, impressive:0.06, in:0.05, into:0.10, iron:0.05, is:0.25, it:0.16, job:0.04, just:0.05, know:0.04, life:0.05, like:0.05, liked:0.05, loki:0.03, love:0.04, made:0.03, main:0.05, make:0.07, making:0.05, man:0.07, many:0.03, marvel:0.13, me:0.03, movie:0.21, movies:0.10, much:0.09, never:0.07, not:0.08, of:0.26, one:0.04, own:0.04, people:0.04, perfect:0.04, performance:0.05, played:0.05, role:0.14, scarlett:0.04, second:0.05, see:0.03, she:0.05, should:0.04, single:0.11, so:0.17, something:0.04, still:0.04, such:0.08, superhero:0.03, take:0.04, team:0.04, the:0.21, their:0.06, them:0.06, then:0.04, there:0.03, they:0.05, this:0.21, thor:0.03, time:0.10, times:0.04, to:0.23, together:0.12, tom:0.08, too:0.03, understand:0.05, us:0.05, very:0.15, villain:0.04, want:0.04, was:0.08, watch:0.03, watched:0.09, watching:0.08, well:0.03, what:0.03, when:0.03, where:0.12, why:0.04, widow:0.03, will:0.06, yet:0.09, you:0.13"

2014-04-07,"Well-drawn characters, beautifully shot and fine set-pieces. Anyway, that's enough about The Artist now onto Avengers Assemble. I'm going to start by telling you I should have liked this. I like a good leave brain-at-the-door, popcorn stuffing uber romp as much as the next person. Having grown up reading Marvel comics I have a bit of a soft spot for The Avengers. I should have liked this... a lot. But... but... but.....For the uninitiated here's the plot: one-eyed Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. (don't ask it gets sillier) assembles a team of disparate superheroes to save the planet from the pan-dimensional pantomime baddie Loki and his army of marauding alien invaders. Yes! Together at last! Mister Blonde, Mister Angry, Mister Smug, Mister Boring, Mister Forgettable and Little Miss Lycra gang up to punch CGI aliens repeatedly in the face whilst Tom Hiddlestone does his best Shere Khan impersonation. Flying battleships? Collapsing buildings? Alien invasion? Rock 'em sock 'em punch ups? Snappy dialogue? Scarlett Johansson in Lycra? Sounds good doesn't it? Well....Robert Downey Junior does his smart-talking smug thing again. Chris Hemsworth does his blonde bombshell anachronistic demi-God thing again. That dull bloke is that dull Captain America again. The Hulk bounces around in unconvincing CGI destructo mode again. Scarlett Johansson does her pouty, spandexy ass kicking thing again. Again and again and again. You get my point. It's all more of the same. Except multiplied. A running, jumping, punching, flying, exploding, CGI extravaganza. All sound and (Nick) fury but signifying nothing other than an, admittedly, smart director helming some famous faces in front of green screen while a legion of CGI artists beaver away at the rendering. Is this movie making or games design? There are plus points. There is at least an attempt at some character development. Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner has a good line of banter with Tony Stark/ Iron Man. There are some decent gags. Tom Hiddleston is enjoying himself being archly camp as the baddie. But, it's just not enough. As once again the whole thing collapses under the weight of more CGI aliens. Let's be honest I went in with the biggest bag of pop-corn. Brain checked in at the door. Expecting to be entertained. I guess I was but to be honest I don't really remember much as I my primary register was... deep breath... boredom.Now before I get kicked to death by hordes of Marvel fan-people (look how PC am I?) None of this is the fault of the film. The 13 year old me (whilst being grumpy with the portrayal of Hawkeye) would probably have thought all his Christmases had come at once.

2025-01-10,"The Avengers is the most enjoyable time I've spent with the MCU so far.It operates with established characters, but they still have character arcs and those are surprisingly very satisfying. Obviously I kind of knew what's going to happen, but that didn't take away a bit from the enjoyment. There were a few moments where I was shocked or didn't know how the story would move forward. The dialogues sometimes feel a little out of place, but are mostly good.The visual effects have never been this good in the MCU so far, I loved that. I also love the huge cast, although I was sad to see one of my favourite actors, Stellan Skarsgård turned into a villain, alongside Jeremy Renner. The cinematography is great, but the movie is a little too long, so I'm not the biggest fan of the editing.

2014-05-23,"I guess The Avengers was the movie many Marvel comics fans were expecting. Finally, after a series of solo movies, a group of the fan favourite heroes were united under the Avengers tag: Ironman, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow and that guy with a bow.The would be hero team bickers a bit in the beginning, as they are reluctantly put together to fight Loki, Thor's brother, who is again trying to take on the world. This time with a help of cube thingie called Tesseract, that opens a portal through which a some sort of biomechanoid warrior race runs through to do the actual conquering.In order to get the full impact of the movie it would probably be the best to know a lot about the Marvel universe, either from the comics or from the movies, as the Avengers doesn't even pretend to be a movie friendly for new viewers. It's not muddled piece of fan service, but it is filled with things, that are left relatively obscure without prior knowledge of what has happened in the Marvel universe. The Avengers is fully watchable, even if you don't know that much about Marvel's world, but it does feel a bit hollow experience none the less. It just can't escape from its roots, which have been made during many other movies.As said, The Avengers is not a bad movie. It's filled with great actors from Samuel L. Jackson to Robert Downy JR, almost all of which are familiar from the previous Marvel movies. Thay all do serviceable roles. They make the movie work, but none of them gets huge amounts of time as people, as the movie expects the viewers to be already familiar with them, be it Tony Starks arrogance or Bruce Banners life in shambles caused by his alter ego.All in all, while the Avengeres is not a perfect movie, it is a nice start for a probably a lot more of them.

2020-08-05,"The Avengers was so much fun and Marvel absolutely nailed it! Let me explain what I loved! Positives: 1. The characters; this is a no brainer! Without these awesome characters this film would be nothing. They honestly shape this film and their banter and chemistry with one another is awesome! There are a lot of humorous as well as heartfelt moments which all lend to an awesome film! 2. The villain; Loki in my opinion is the best villain of the MCU. He has motivation you understand and his rivalry with Thor is mesmerizing! Tom Hiddleston once again does a fantastic job as this character and he was the perfect villain for this movie. 3. The action; all of the action is done well! There is quite a lot of CGI, but it doesn't get in the way of the film, and because of these awesome characters all the action and explosions have weight to them. If these characters hadn't been characterized properly, and it didn't have a well made story then this film would've probably turned out like a Transformers movie.

2022-01-27,"""The Avengers"" (2012), I remember when this movie was first announced, the hype for it was insane. Truth be told, I was probably just as excited as everyone else. Ever since I saw the post-credit scene in ""Iron Man"" (2008), I thought: ""no, are they really going to go in this direction?"" Sure enough, the ending of ""The Incredible Hulk"" (2008) confirmed that they were building up to teaming up the Avengers. For the next few years, I was eagerly waiting for ""The Avengers"" to come out. Eventually, at long last, it was released. The wait was absolutely worth it, and then some. In fact, ""The Avengers"" was actually even better than I thought it was going to be! It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The plot is, Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner and Thor are recruited by Nick Fury and the spy agency S. H. I. E. L. D. to stop Thor's brother Loki from taking over the world. Now, to some, that story may sound a little bit too miniscule. However, for a film of this caliber, a simple plot is warranted. It allows for extra character development, as well as better action and fight scenes. In some cases, that may be too many characters for one movie alone, and there's not too much character development. But, here's the thing, in the films leading up to this one, we already met these characters and know everything we need to know about them. That's one critical thing Marvel did correctly, they did individual superhero movies and built up to the team-up. Whereas DC did it backwards, and did the climactic team-up first then the individual films later. They just had the heroes run into the action without any character development. That's one of the biggest cardinal rules of cinema, in my opinion, character development. Without that, then the movie won't have any impact. Marvel did it all correctly, and stared with character development first, and that's what allows for ""The Avengers"" to shine even more. Unlike watching modern day DC films, when you watch Marvel movies, you actually care about the characters and what's going on. Any way, I won't go into any details about the plot. But, I guarantee that it's a story that you'll remember for the rest of your life. This film may be 142 minutes in length, but it goes by in the blink of an eye. When a long movie goes by fast, you know it's a winner! As far as the acting goes, it's just as outstanding as the story itself. The whole cast gives it their all with their performances. That's another thing Marvel superhero films do better than DC, acting. Good acting is critical for a movie to stand out. It just shows how passionate Marvel Studios is, and makes this film all the more enjoyable. The cast is absolutely insane, their on-screen chemistry is impeccable! All of the sets/locations are beautiful, and give the film an stunning atmosphere. They really help make it look like a real-life comic book! As far as the special effects go, they are perfect and still hold up to this day. Which is no surprise, being made in 2012! Finally, the soundtrack composed by Alan Silvestri is exceptional and his film score sets the perfect tone for the movie. Alan Silvestri is one of my top ten all-time favorite film score composers, and the soundtrack for this movie is no different. Every film score I've heard written by him is very well done, to say the least and this one here is no different. ""The Avengers"" is a phenomenal superhero movie, and it has found a place on my top five favorite Marvel films. It's still just as fun to watch today, as it was back when it was first released. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""The Avengers"", what are you waiting for? Go and see it today! Just skip it's sequel, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015), that movie sucks and it's easily the worst Marvel Cinematic Universe film. But, before you see ""The Avengers"", I recommend watching the first few movies first. It'll make the payoff with this film much more worth it. If you don't watch ""The Avengers"", look out for Loki!",10.0,2022-01,Thursday,"10:0.05, 2012:0.06, about:0.05, absolutely:0.07, acting:0.10, action:0.03, actually:0.05, again:0.02, all:0.06, already:0.03, also:0.02, an:0.03, and:0.21, another:0.03, any:0.09, are:0.07, as:0.16, at:0.02, avengers:0.13, back:0.03, banner:0.02, be:0.06, before:0.02, being:0.02, better:0.07, biggest:0.03, bit:0.03, book:0.02, brother:0.03, bruce:0.03, but:0.05, by:0.08, can:0.02, care:0.03, cast:0.05, character:0.09, characters:0.05, cinema:0.03, cinematic:0.03, come:0.02, comic:0.02, day:0.07, development:0.15, did:0.11, different:0.06, do:0.02, don:0.02, done:0.03, effects:0.04, else:0.03, enough:0.03, even:0.04, ever:0.02, every:0.02, everyone:0.03, everything:0.03, fact:0.03, far:0.05, favorite:0.06, few:0.05, fight:0.03, film:0.15, films:0.11, finally:0.03, first:0.12, for:0.15, found:0.03, from:0.02, fun:0.02, fury:0.02, get:0.02, give:0.03, giving:0.03, go:0.09, goes:0.10, going:0.07, good:0.02, had:0.02, has:0.03, have:0.01, haven:0.03, help:0.03, here:0.05, heroes:0.02, him:0.02, his:0.02, how:0.02, however:0.03, hulk:0.01, hype:0.03, if:0.03, imdb:0.04, in:0.09, incredible:0.03, individual:0.07, into:0.04, iron:0.02, is:0.13, it:0.26, itself:0.03, just:0.09, know:0.07, last:0.03, least:0.03, life:0.06, like:0.02, little:0.03, ll:0.06, loki:0.04, long:0.05, look:0.06, made:0.02, make:0.04, makes:0.02, man:0.02, many:0.02, marvel:0.12, may:0.09, minutes:0.03, more:0.05, movie:0.11, movies:0.05, much:0.04, my:0.07, need:0.03, never:0.02, next:0.03, nick:0.02, no:0.08, not:0.01, now:0.02, of:0.11, on:0.06, one:0.08, opinion:0.03, out:0.08, over:0.07, perfect:0.18, performances:0.03, place:0.03, plot:0.07, probably:0.03, real:0.03, really:0.04, recommend:0.03, rest:0.03, saw:0.03, say:0.02, scene:0.03, scenes:0.02, screen:0.02, see:0.03, seen:0.02, sequel:0.03, simple:0.03, since:0.03, some:0.05, special:0.05, stand:0.03, stark:0.03, stars:0.07, still:0.05, stop:0.03, story:0.07, superhero:0.06, sure:0.03, team:0.05, than:0.04, that:0.12, the:0.42, their:0.05, them:0.02, then:0.07, there:0.02, these:0.02, they:0.09, thing:0.08, this:0.12, thor:0.03, thought:0.05, time:0.02, to:0.15, together:0.02, tony:0.03, too:0.06, top:0.06, universe:0.03, up:0.12, ve:0.02, very:0.02, wait:0.03, was:0.12, watch:0.08, watching:0.05, way:0.02, we:0.04, well:0.03, were:0.02, what:0.05, when:0.07, which:0.04, whole:0.03, with:0.04, without:0.05, won:0.07, world:0.02, worth:0.06, written:0.03, years:0.03, you:0.11, your:0.02"

2022-05-05,"""There was an idea, called the Avengers Initiative. The idea was to bring together a group of of remarkable people to see if they could become something more. To see if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could"". - Nick Fury. And producer Kevin Feige brought that idea to life 10 years ago. I remember being excited to watch the movie with my family and everything still holds up. The jokes, the fight scenes, the cast's chemistry and the incredible musical score from Alan Silvestri. It was all crafted beautifully thanks to Joss Whedon's amazing direction and killer script. Even Thanos' cameo still holds up until his scene-stealing performance in ""Infinity War"" and ""Endgame"". It still remains one of the greatest superhero movies of all time and one of the greatest movies ever made period. Just like ""The Dark Knight"" became an influential movie in the superhero genre, ""The Avengers"" is a influential movie on how to make crossovers and team-up stories the right way. Growing up in the 2000's, Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" trilogy, X-Men and The Dark Knight were the superhero movies that had a impact on my childhood but didn't create a lot of buzz because of ""Harry Potter"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""Twilight"". The 2010's became the gold standard for superhero movies as ""The Avengers"" and later ""Endgame"" broke box office records and the MCU became the new ""Star Wars"". Marvel continues to excite, thrill and bring something new that I can't wait for the next groundbreaking hit.

2021-01-16,"The last hour is a lot of fun, but I found the opening chunk disappointing.I was expecting wall-to-wall action, pretty much from the start - especially given the forces that join together. However, I felt the first half of 'The Avengers' as slow. What also didn't help is that the villain, carried over from a preceding MCU film, isn't super interesting - we also don't see the antagonist's earlier film counterpart for a fair few scenes, which felt too delayed.The last half is much better, which allowed me to enjoy myself properly. Robert Downey Jr., while not as entertaining as he is on his own, brings goodness, as do the likes of Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth.I'm not a big fan of recasts, though Mark Ruffalo as Hulk is a positive one; even if that took a bit away from the novelty of all the superheroes joining, given we hadn't seen Ruffalo himself before. Added to Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, at least in terms of the film franchise, getting major screen time out of nowhere - having been a bit part character in her debut MCU appearance.The music is noteworthy, while everything looks brilliant.

2024-03-17,"Among 2012 summer blockbusters, no other titles have garnered as much attention and praise as Avengers. Directed by Joss Whedon, this superhero ensemble film marked a groundbreaking moment in the MCU, bringing together iconic characters for a spectacle of action and mayhem. While undeniably entertaining, it's hard to ignore the lingering feeling that the film's reputation might have overstated its impact.The premise is simple yet enticing: Earth's mightiest heroes-Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye-join forces to thwart an alien invasion orchestrated by Loki. The film's success, however, leans heavily on its presentation of the heroes' collective camaraderie and, of course, the action-packed set pieces.From a technical standpoint, Avengers hits all the right notes. The special effects and choreographed battles are a visual spectacle, catering to fans of explosive action and superhuman feats. Joss Whedon's direction seamlessly juggles the ensemble cast, allowing each hero to showcase their signature powers and personality quirks. Yet, this triumph often overshadows a more pressing question: Is there more substance beneath the surface?The film's narrative ambition doesn't quite match its technical prowess. Avengers leans heavily on its tried-and-true formula, where heroes initially clash due to differing viewpoints, only to unite against a common threat. This formulaic structure, while a staple of superhero storytelling, fails to provide the depth and nuance that could elevate the film beyond mere popcorn entertainment.One of the key criticisms directed at Avengers is its lack of profound themes or underlying messages. Unlike some of its MCU counterparts, which delve into complex moral dilemmas and societal reflections, Avengers predominantly rests on the laurels of spectacle and the thrill of seeing beloved characters share the screen. The film's humor, while often enjoyable, occasionally undercuts moments that could have carried more weight.Character development, too, takes a backseat to the film's action-oriented focus. While each hero brings their own charisma to the table, their arcs largely remain within the confines of their established personas. Moments of introspection or growth tend to be fleeting, leaving audiences hungry for more substantial evolution.In conclusion, Avengers is by no means a bad movie. Its status as a cornerstone of the MCU is well-deserved, considering its pioneering feat of assembling beloved characters on such a grand scale. However, the film's reputation as a game-changer might overshadow its shortcomings. It's an entertaining watch that delivers on its promise of action and hero camaraderie, but its lack of deeper thematic exploration and character depth prevents it from ascending to the echelons of true cinematic greatness.",6.0,2024-03,Sunday,"2012:0.05, action:0.12, against:0.05, alien:0.05, all:0.02, america:0.03, an:0.06, and:0.21, are:0.02, as:0.09, at:0.03, avengers:0.14, bad:0.04, be:0.02, black:0.04, brings:0.06, but:0.02, by:0.09, captain:0.03, cast:0.04, character:0.07, characters:0.08, cinematic:0.06, could:0.08, course:0.05, depth:0.12, development:0.05, doesn:0.05, each:0.07, earth:0.05, effects:0.04, ensemble:0.12, entertaining:0.09, entertainment:0.06, fans:0.05, film:0.21, for:0.04, from:0.05, hard:0.05, have:0.07, hawkeye:0.04, hero:0.13, heroes:0.11, however:0.10, hulk:0.03, humor:0.05, in:0.04, into:0.04, iron:0.03, is:0.09, it:0.05, its:0.41, joss:0.07, loki:0.03, man:0.03, mcu:0.17, might:0.11, moment:0.06, moments:0.10, more:0.12, movie:0.02, much:0.03, no:0.07, of:0.28, on:0.13, one:0.02, only:0.03, or:0.06, other:0.03, own:0.05, packed:0.05, powers:0.06, quite:0.05, right:0.05, screen:0.04, seeing:0.05, set:0.05, simple:0.06, some:0.03, special:0.04, such:0.05, summer:0.06, superhero:0.07, takes:0.06, that:0.08, the:0.39, their:0.13, there:0.03, this:0.05, thor:0.03, to:0.19, together:0.03, too:0.04, true:0.11, visual:0.06, watch:0.03, well:0.03, whedon:0.07, where:0.04, which:0.03, while:0.19, widow:0.04, yet:0.10"

To be frank, I found all the Avengers themselves lived up to expectations, but the overall storyline and plot was not worthy of the super heroes so many have come to love and adore. The truth is that with so many central characters their opportunity to shine is limited, no matter how well they play their roles. The Dark Knight is, in my opinion, the pinnacle of the super hero genre(so far) and the Avengers doesn't come close. Sorry guys I know I will have offended a few Marvel Maniacs with that comment but it really is true if you look deep enough within yourselves, The Dark Knight is one of the best films of all time, the Avangers is not, plain and simple.

2012-05-16,"I will try to analyze this movie from a different point of view than most of the critics do. I went to see this movie without any expectations because of many favourable critics but I haven't seen movies such as Captain America, Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and so on. Usually, superhero movies are not my cup of tea and I find them rather childish and only focused on special effects and the same old redundant stories.This movie is among the better superhero movies but it's definitely not the big thing many people claim it to be.On the positive side, we have the great 3D effects that are really worth watching this movie in the cinema in comparison to many movies in 3D that are not quite spectacular and only try to raise the gross. The graphics and special effects of this movie are flawless and of the highest modern standards thanks to an exaggeratedly high budget of course.But there are other positive things to find. Robert Downey Jr. does once again an incredible job and becomes a better actor in my estimation each time I see him in a new movie. He is some kind of a slightly crazy but charming dreamer with a sense for romance and cool humour and incarnates the Iron Man in a perfect way. Mark Ruffallo plays a rather calm and intellectual gentleman that becomes the Hulk as soon as he doesn't control his anger. His acting is also very authentic and grounded in this over the top movie. These two actors really impressed me the most but Tom Hiddlestone as the egoistic avenger and half god Loki and the great Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury are also quite convincing while the other actors can't catch up with these four talented actors.On the other side, the story kicks off way too fast and if you don't know much about the Marvel characters, you will feel a little bit lost in the beginning. It's not quite clear who is attacking whom and why in the first couple of minutes but after that, the pace of the movie slows down and introduces the different characters in a solid way. In the case of the Hulk or Natasha Romanov (as she seems to be of Russian origin, her actual name should be ""Romanova"" - it's a pity that such a famous movie with such a big budget has this kind of stupid error), the introduction's scenes are amusing and entertaining while the presentations of Captain America or the Iron Man are not very well thought out in my opinion.On the other side, the story of this movie is pretty generic and also predictable. The movie also has some important length in the middle of the film as the superheroes are discussing on the giant airship. The battle scenes in the end of the movie also get rather boring after a while and lack of diversity. The ending is also too much of a common standard to truly impress.In the end, there are almost as many negative as there are positive things to mention but as the quality of the positive facts is quite elevated and a more important factor than the pure quantity and as this movie was almost very well entertaining me over a quite long running time with two little exceptions, I may give a shyly positive seven points to this flick. After all, I might now try out the movies about Hulk and the Iron Man who are my favourite characters in this movie and can't deny that this movie awoke some interest in me to dig a little bit further into the Marvel world I have missed out.",7.0,2012-05,Wednesday,"3d:0.07, about:0.04, acting:0.03, actor:0.04, actors:0.09, after:0.08, again:0.03, all:0.01, almost:0.07, also:0.14, america:0.04, an:0.04, and:0.26, any:0.03, are:0.20, as:0.17, avenger:0.04, battle:0.03, be:0.05, because:0.02, beginning:0.04, better:0.05, big:0.05, bit:0.06, boring:0.04, but:0.10, can:0.04, captain:0.04, characters:0.06, cinema:0.04, cool:0.04, course:0.04, definitely:0.03, different:0.07, do:0.03, does:0.03, doesn:0.03, don:0.02, down:0.03, downey:0.02, each:0.02, effects:0.07, end:0.06, entertaining:0.06, expectations:0.04, feel:0.03, film:0.02, find:0.07, first:0.02, for:0.01, four:0.04, from:0.02, fury:0.03, get:0.02, give:0.03, god:0.03, great:0.04, half:0.04, has:0.04, have:0.03, haven:0.04, he:0.04, her:0.04, high:0.03, him:0.03, his:0.04, hulk:0.07, humour:0.04, if:0.02, in:0.21, incredible:0.03, into:0.02, iron:0.08, is:0.08, it:0.05, jackson:0.03, job:0.03, jr:0.03, kind:0.07, know:0.03, little:0.09, loki:0.02, long:0.03, man:0.07, many:0.10, mark:0.03, marvel:0.04, may:0.03, me:0.07, might:0.04, minutes:0.04, more:0.02, most:0.05, movie:0.19, movies:0.10, much:0.04, my:0.08, new:0.03, nick:0.03, not:0.08, now:0.03, of:0.23, off:0.03, old:0.04, on:0.10, once:0.04, only:0.05, opinion:0.04, or:0.04, other:0.09, out:0.06, over:0.05, people:0.03, perfect:0.03, point:0.04, pretty:0.03, quite:0.17, rather:0.12, really:0.04, robert:0.02, same:0.03, samuel:0.03, scenes:0.05, see:0.04, seems:0.04, seen:0.03, sense:0.04, she:0.04, should:0.03, so:0.02, some:0.06, special:0.06, spectacular:0.04, story:0.04, such:0.09, superhero:0.04, superheroes:0.03, than:0.04, that:0.08, the:0.51, them:0.02, there:0.06, these:0.05, thing:0.03, things:0.07, this:0.14, thor:0.02, thought:0.03, time:0.04, to:0.14, tom:0.03, too:0.05, top:0.03, truly:0.04, two:0.06, up:0.02, very:0.07, was:0.01, watching:0.03, way:0.08, we:0.03, well:0.04, went:0.04, while:0.09, who:0.04, why:0.03, will:0.04, with:0.06, without:0.03, world:0.03, worth:0.03, you:0.03"
2012-05-12,"The movie was shouting so loud to catch attention and it certainly did. Too bad it was so disappointing and shallow afterwards... 3D did not entertain or maybe dragged the whole movie down even more than the sad plot.From the beginning it was clear to me that the movie won't jump high enough and come up to my expectations, all I had to do was watch the trailer and it told me how the whole movie will be - explosions, dorky costumes, pointless dialogs and lame jokes that recently have flooded Hollywood. Surely when the Avengers came out and I saw the rating (8.8 ?!), I assumed that I was wrong. Such great score! I just had to see this magnificent, most brilliant movie ever. Time in the theater passed and my little sparkle died rather quickly. Not only did some parts could have been cut out to shorten the torture, but they could have added a little bit of originality too. No matter how I look at it, some scenes and ideas resemble Transformers 3.This was not brilliant at all.

2022-02-11,"""The Avengers"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch the mightiest heroes of Earth come together in order to defend it by Loki (Thor's brother) and his alien army. They have to fight as a team if they want to win and save humanity.I liked this movie very much because it was the first movie that many of the Marvel heroes that we had already watched their films came together and formed The Avengers. It contained plenty of action scenes, the plot was very interesting and it also contained some unexpected plot twists that made it even more interesting. In addition to this, the direction which was made by Joss Whedon was very good and he did an excellent job on the way he combined all these amazing heroes. The interpretations of Robert Downey Jr. Who played as Tony Stark, Chris Evans who played as Steve Rogers, Chris Hemsworth who played as Thor, Scarlett Johansson who played as Natasha Romanoff and Mark Ruffalo who played as Bruce Banner were very good and their combination worked very well. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Avengers"" is a nice, entertaining movie to spend your time with and I am sure it will amaze you.",8.0,2022-02,Friday,"action:0.07, alien:0.08, all:0.03, already:0.08, also:0.05, am:0.07, amazing:0.06, an:0.08, and:0.20, army:0.08, as:0.21, avengers:0.10, banner:0.07, because:0.06, brother:0.08, bruce:0.07, by:0.09, came:0.08, chris:0.13, come:0.06, did:0.06, downey:0.06, earth:0.07, entertaining:0.07, evans:0.07, even:0.05, excellent:0.08, fight:0.07, films:0.06, first:0.05, good:0.08, had:0.05, have:0.07, he:0.09, hemsworth:0.07, heroes:0.16, his:0.05, if:0.05, in:0.08, interesting:0.16, is:0.05, it:0.16, job:0.07, johansson:0.07, joss:0.05, jr:0.06, liked:0.09, loki:0.05, made:0.11, many:0.06, mark:0.06, marvel:0.04, more:0.04, movie:0.12, much:0.05, nice:0.09, of:0.10, on:0.04, played:0.40, plot:0.12, robert:0.06, ruffalo:0.06, save:0.09, say:0.06, scarlett:0.07, scenes:0.06, some:0.05, stark:0.07, sure:0.07, team:0.06, that:0.12, the:0.24, their:0.09, these:0.06, they:0.08, this:0.05, thor:0.09, time:0.04, to:0.18, together:0.10, tony:0.07, up:0.05, very:0.25, want:0.07, was:0.13, watch:0.05, watched:0.08, way:0.06, we:0.11, well:0.05, were:0.05, whedon:0.05, which:0.11, who:0.25, will:0.05, with:0.03, you:0.04, your:0.07"

2022-10-19,"No other movie has done a better job combining different main characters with different ongoing storylines. The Justice League got nowhere close (even the overrated but better than original Snyder Cut), not Jurassic World Dominion, not Star Wars (the sequels which are also very bad). The only piece of fiction that I would argue that did as good of a job combining characters is Game of Thrones. This movie also set the standard for invasions and cgi fights. I kept you invested and was pure fun to watch. When Hulk stops the giant alien worm and the 6 unit in a pan around shot complimented by the legendary music every audience member goes nuts and you are left with goosebumps. This same music is played during the Thor Wakanda entrance and portal scene from Endgame. Point being that this theme is used only for the most epic music. This is a top 20 scene in fiction and one that would shape history in film. Before this, comic superhero movies weren't all that popular. This is when, as a young kid, I became hooked and am still now with the MCU. Very disgusted to see how bad Phase 4 is turning out to be. Iron Man and Hulk carry this movie with Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury and Black Widow adding strong support. I will say this was a weaker movie for Thor and Captain American and his awful costume. Nick Fury and Black Widow do a great job of tying all the main characters together and introduce the audience to SHIELD. Every scene on the Helli carrier was worth watching. I loved how randomly Tony pointed out the Galaga player and the team's argument. Hulk is terrifying, which he should be, and we get see him on both sides. His fight with Thor was short but epic. Loki is an amazing villain to go up against everyone. Hiddleston gives a great performance with little. It makes sense why they didn't kill him off in this one. The death in the movie was sad but necessary to provide some stakes. The end invasion was kept simple enough to show off every character. And it ended in a unique way. Captain America vs Iron man is a great concept and started in this movie. They make for great allies and rivals. Black Widow, Bruce, Iron Man, and Captain America's opening scenes were all good. This is the only movie in which I have liked Ruffalo as Bruce. I will say he did great in this one. I don't care about the comedian in the other movies.

2012-09-04,"I have been a comic fan since the mid 90's. After a gap of almost 15 years a recently picked up my old hobby. Much has changed since I last read Spider-man, Wolverine and The Punisher. I never have been a fan of Fantastic Four or The Avengers. And after this movie, I won't change my mind about it.Not that The Avengers is a bad film, it's really not. But it's not all that the hype pretends it is. Whedon makes a very enjoyable popcorn-movie that's true to it's comic book roots. You get a lot of bang for your buck: 6 superheroes in a 2+ hour movie. Whedon keeps all his movies light and with humor. I finally see what he intended with Alien Resurrection. Although I still think it would not have worked. Alien doesn't lend itself for humor. But this material does. And Whedon does it well. The story isn't too complicated. I'm glad all these movies use elements from the golden or silver age of the original comics. The story is a old-school kinda story. Not complicated and with little back story (because all of them had an individual one. Some even two!).The effects are well done, although I think on a TV screen (even by today's standards), it's just too chaotic to really follow. I had the same feeling with the horrendous Transformer-films. Although the action in this film isn't half as confusing as those three turds.All and all: it's a nice blockbuster with steady performances, good action and an old fashioned, humorous story. I could write half a page about it being a little too patriotic and militaristic, but hey, I'm European.

2012-05-17,"You will be dazzled and ultimately somewhat exhausted by all the characters and story lines. I love each one of these heroes individually, but I have to admit it was all too much for me. And then, for sentiment, they add a gratuitous scene (which is real sad) when a minor character dies to give context to it all. It was dashed together, crammed together, and bashed up all together. I am glad I went to see it but I was a bit bewildered and my butt hurt. I was overwhelmed and underwhelmed. I think that is really all I have to say but this site wants me to write much more and I think I have said enough.

2012-10-05,"After reading many very positive reviews about this movie I thought I had to watch it. After watching, most surprising to me was that the movie didn't surprise a single moment! It wasn't interesting at all, fell asleep at least 3 times while watching it. In fact these moments of sleep/ half sleep are the moments I will remember best when thinking back of The Avengers. I like looking at movies a lot and can enjoy very different genres and qualities, but falling asleep while watching is something I usually don't or cannot do. So this movie -especially in its genre- must be a complete failure. What do I remember after a few days? A bad guy that really wasn't scary, some super heroes that had to fight together to stop that bad guy (and some more I guess), some images of them being on a space ship, and that's it! That's all! What about the end? I'm sure I was awake at that moment of time but I simply can't remember. It could have only been the heroes winning the battle but how and where? I think they saved the earth and have been trying hard to do so, but at least it happened without any unexpected or original idea. So for this movie, there is even no chance of writing a review that contains spoilers! What could possibly be there to spoil?

Wasn't there someone commanding Loki? Maybe we'll still see that guy in a later movie? I'm also not sure about how I feel that the enemy wasn't strong, they just had numbers - i.e. There was no final boss. And oh well new Hulk actor who kind of behaves quite differently from the initial one is weird.The power balance also seems off.

2012-08-28,"""The Avengers"" is an okay superhero movie; that's it. A great deal of the problem is that there are too many characters at once. The viewer doesn't get any time to understand most of the characters' backstories or motivations. They are suddenly called up for duty to defend the earth against the scrawny and mysterious alien supervillain based off of a Norse god. Most of the superheroes were not interesting, as their personalities were not that well-developed. The exception to this is Iron Man, who is wonderfully played by Robert Downey, Jr. Iron Man is depicted as a wealthy sarcastic playboy who isn't necessarily a hero for altruistic reasons. The smarminess and smugness of Iron Man's character may turn a lot of people off; but hey, at least it's a ""character"". There are a few scenes where the Hulk is really funny, but that is only as the Hulk persona, rather than as Bruce Banner. The rest of the superheroes are bland and undeveloped as characters. The film is also confused as to its tone. It tries to take its superhero world seriously, like the Tim Burton's ""Batman"" but also adds in tongue-in-cheek humor and makes attempts to be self-referential and campy, like the Joel Schumaker ""Batmans"". The balance is uneven at best. The film's characters, with the exception of the Incredible Hulk, do not have enough fame or notoriety, like that of Superman, Batman or Spiderman, to be familiar to a general audience. This film is catered to an audience intimately familiar with the Marvel Comics universe and all of its characters, which will leave an uninitiated viewer utterly clueless about who's who. Who the heck is Black Widow? Nick Fury? Why do Thor and Loki speak in a bizarre, overly-proper form of English? Is it because they're aliens? Why should we care?It is merely a personal matter of taste, but CGI has not evolved to the point where the special effects look entirely real; the closest computer animation has gotten to being realistic is James Cameron's ""Avatar"", where the aliens have genuinely human expressions and movements. The CGI in ""The Avengers"" is ugly to look at, particularly the ship the Avengers use as a home base, as well as the alien invaders towards the end. It is not worth it to pay extra for 3-D glasses to watch grey, ugly aliens riding grey, ugly spiny snakes while emerging from grey, ugly, bland modernistic monstrosities that pass for alien spaceships. The ultimate irony is the cheap gorilla and diving suit from ""Robot Monster"" (haven't seen the movies, just stills) looks more creative and inspired than the effects in this movie. The point is that there is little color and beauty in the CGI, and it always looks more fake and lifeless than rubber puppets or furry Ewok costumes ever could. I would go so far to say that the greyness and blandness of the alien and Avengers' flying fortress design totally detracted from the power of the action sequences. Notwithstanding the distracting CGI, the action scenes, as stand- alone pieces, are engaging and entertaining to watch.In short, ""The Avengers"" lacks interesting characters and, while not entirely the fault of the filmmakers (technology still has a long way to go in 2012 before anything approaching realism can be fully realized, so my criticism in unfair in that respect), the CGI wasn't pleasant to look at. Watch ""The Avengers"" for the action scenes and for Hulk and Iron Man, who are funny and interesting. It's a fair effort, but nothing that approaches a timeless action classic. At least the Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" movies were infused with tongue-in-cheek humor and had an undeniable camp value; ""The Avengers"" takes itself too seriously to become a nostalgic classic like ""Superman"".",6.0,2012-08,Tuesday,"2012:0.04, about:0.02, action:0.07, against:0.04, alien:0.15, all:0.01, also:0.05, always:0.03, an:0.08, and:0.24, any:0.03, anything:0.03, are:0.10, as:0.16, at:0.12, audience:0.07, avengers:0.11, banner:0.03, batman:0.08, be:0.05, because:0.03, become:0.04, before:0.03, being:0.03, best:0.02, black:0.03, bruce:0.03, but:0.07, by:0.02, can:0.02, care:0.04, cgi:0.16, character:0.04, characters:0.11, comics:0.03, could:0.03, do:0.05, doesn:0.03, downey:0.03, earth:0.03, effects:0.05, end:0.03, enough:0.03, entertaining:0.03, ever:0.03, far:0.03, few:0.03, film:0.05, for:0.09, from:0.06, funny:0.06, fury:0.03, get:0.02, go:0.05, god:0.03, great:0.02, had:0.02, has:0.06, have:0.03, haven:0.04, hero:0.03, hulk:0.07, humor:0.06, in:0.14, incredible:0.03, interesting:0.11, iron:0.08, is:0.23, isn:0.04, it:0.11, its:0.08, itself:0.04, jr:0.03, just:0.02, least:0.07, like:0.07, little:0.03, loki:0.02, long:0.03, look:0.11, looks:0.08, lot:0.03, makes:0.03, man:0.08, many:0.03, marvel:0.02, may:0.04, more:0.04, most:0.05, movie:0.03, movies:0.04, my:0.02, nick:0.03, not:0.10, nothing:0.03, of:0.17, off:0.06, once:0.04, only:0.02, or:0.08, people:0.03, played:0.04, point:0.07, power:0.04, rather:0.04, re:0.03, real:0.04, really:0.02, rest:0.04, robert:0.03, say:0.03, scenes:0.08, seen:0.03, sequences:0.04, short:0.04, should:0.03, so:0.04, special:0.03, stand:0.04, still:0.03, superhero:0.05, superheroes:0.05, take:0.03, takes:0.04, than:0.07, that:0.14, the:0.57, their:0.02, there:0.06, they:0.04, this:0.04, thor:0.02, time:0.02, to:0.22, too:0.05, understand:0.04, universe:0.04, up:0.02, wasn:0.04, watch:0.07, way:0.03, we:0.03, well:0.04, were:0.07, where:0.09, which:0.02, while:0.06, who:0.14, why:0.06, widow:0.03, will:0.02, with:0.04, world:0.03, worth:0.03, would:0.02"
2021-04-16,"This film has everything you want in a team up super hero film from grear action to great characters.The fight choreography was great not because of john wick level action sequences but just really fun and enjoyable action scemes that really embrace comic book fun.The villain loki is perfect as although he may have a generic motavation, the way clashes with the heroes ideologies and has huge amounts of personality made him unforgettable.One of my favourite things about this movie is the sense of urgency and dread, it really does feel like anything could happen and some thing could go wrong and this is due to some great writing and acting. Another thing i love is that the characters work so well with each oher and are handled so well, the best avengers (not in power but in character complexity) are all focused on more than the more boring characters which is awesome as it feels no potential was lost in the characters and it shows they actually put thought into there characters.Overall this movie still holds up as one of the best and most unforgettable mcu experiences but was still dissapionting in someAvengers was a huge moment for superhero films when it released back in 2012. A culmination of 4 years worth of individual superhero films featuring Iron Man (twice), Thor, Captain America and Hulk. I remember the hype surrounding it, there was no way this film could live up to fan expectations I thought...but I was wrong. In some ways it's a love letter to Marvel fans filled with easter eggs, humourous observations and more displays of super powers than you can shake a mjolnir at! But it's also simple yet effective in plot, a continuation of every individual Marvel film to date as of 2012 and it works. It's easy to follow but not only that, you can sort of start watching at any point and still be able to enjoy it. There are a number of great scenes and first time character interactions and I loved the strained dynamics. When the actual battle of New York starts the action ramps up further and it still contains some of the most fun moments of the entire MCU. Even though the world is at stake it never really feels like it because it's localised in New York but it's also not an emotionally heavy film, it's just a lot of fun for the majority from beginning to end. With so much going on at once though the action can get repetitive and therefore drag, creating occasional boring bits. The film does a great job of showcasing each heroes individual abilities by putting them in various situations in which they excell but it also does a great job of not making one hero appear drastically stronger than the rest. Captain America may not physically be able to compete with the bigger boys of the team, even with his super soldier enhancements, but he has excellent fighting skills, is a great strategist and has a shield that can't be broken which also happens to be a symbol of hope for many. Iron Man has arguably the largest arsenal of offensive weaponry but only when wearing his suit. The Hulk is arguably the strongest and most durable but also unpredictable and lacks intelligence. Thor is naturally the strongest of all and has the ability to control lightening through his magical hammer but he's also arrogant, ignorant and rash in his decision making, not to mention he can also be easy to trick. Hawkeye is a good fighter but not on the same level as Cap or Black Widow, he also doesn't have any physical advantages but he is deadly accurate with his bow and various arrows and can cause a lot of havoc from a distance. Black Widow has no physical enhancements either but her fighting skills are arguably the best in the team, even compared to Captain America, she's extremely proficient with hand guns and a brilliant actor enabling her to be the perfect undercover agent.I love this film as a lazy afternoon watch. It has humour, plenty of action, great special effects, a fitting score and easy to follow. It has some slow spots but it's the most ""fun"" feeling of all the Avengers films, it doesn't have this dark overtone the others contain. It's also an easy watch because you don't need to pay too much attention to everything.

2012-09-25,"I have seen ""The Avengers"" twice now. I really wanted to like the movie and after seeing it for the first time, I didn't quite like it, so I gave the movie a second chance to absorb myself more and found out that my first Judgement about the movie was quite right.The Avengers has some awesome special effects (just like every other movie these days Transformers, Battleship, Darkshadows etc). There are a few scenes in particular that I liked in the movie :- + Black Widow's introduction was quite amazing + The Fight scene in the S.H.I.E.L.D Carrier was intense and amazing + The Final Fight Scene is truly breathtaking and heartwarming too (psstt you know what the Iron Man does) Almost the rest of it was quite Formulic, bad guy tries to take over the world, brings the army, Avengers are assembled and huge intense action scenes.I really wanted the characters to interact with each other more and get to know about each others strength and weaknesses. I also would have loved an intense plot with maybe a twist to surprise us in some way. I am really hoping that they take the criticism of the movie made by the fans at heart and improve on everything what they did here.I still have high hopes for The Avengers in there next movie and I am really hoping that I would get to give it at least an 8 or a 9 the next time around.P.S I saw the deleted scenes of the movie, they all fitted quite well and added more to the story, don't know why they decided to take it out.",6.0,2012-09,Tuesday,"about:0.08, action:0.03, after:0.05, all:0.03, almost:0.07, also:0.04, am:0.12, amazing:0.11, an:0.07, and:0.21, are:0.06, army:0.07, around:0.07, at:0.07, avengers:0.12, awesome:0.06, bad:0.06, black:0.05, brings:0.07, by:0.04, characters:0.03, did:0.05, didn:0.06, does:0.05, don:0.05, each:0.09, effects:0.05, every:0.05, everything:0.06, fans:0.06, few:0.06, fight:0.12, final:0.07, first:0.09, for:0.05, found:0.08, get:0.09, give:0.06, guy:0.07, has:0.04, have:0.09, here:0.05, high:0.06, huge:0.07, in:0.12, iron:0.04, is:0.02, it:0.11, just:0.03, know:0.16, least:0.07, like:0.10, liked:0.07, loved:0.07, made:0.05, man:0.03, maybe:0.07, more:0.11, movie:0.19, my:0.04, next:0.14, now:0.05, of:0.06, on:0.03, or:0.04, other:0.08, others:0.07, out:0.07, over:0.05, plot:0.05, quite:0.31, really:0.16, rest:0.07, right:0.06, saw:0.06, scene:0.11, scenes:0.14, second:0.07, seeing:0.06, seen:0.05, so:0.03, some:0.08, special:0.05, still:0.05, story:0.04, take:0.18, that:0.10, the:0.46, there:0.07, these:0.05, they:0.14, time:0.07, to:0.19, too:0.05, transformers:0.07, truly:0.07, us:0.07, was:0.11, way:0.05, well:0.04, what:0.08, why:0.06, widow:0.05, with:0.05, world:0.05, would:0.08, you:0.03"
2012-05-23,"If you honestly love one of those heroes (Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man or Thor), this movie is will be a pleasure for you. However, if you want to see The Avengers because of thrilling special effects or tense action, you will be disappointed. First 2/3 of the movie is constant talking and staring at each other followed with cliché super-hero-type lines and couple of fights between each other. If not R. Downey's Iron Man and his sense of humor it would be a pure pain. I don't know if it was because of too salty popcorns or because of lack of action on the screen, but after an hour of watching it I became really, really bored. I'd bet on the latter, however... :)The last ~1/5 of The Avengers is the battle in NYC. Fight scenes, humour, and CG looks pretty good. However, there is slight feeling that everything was just too easy.

2012-05-12,"Blockbuster actions scenes and CGI, but held back by a video game script. Accurate to the comic books or not, the premise was insufficient for a project with such potential, but on the bright side, this is what playing video games on playstation 10 will look like most likely, and probably with a story line as equal to the one from Avengers, hopefully better though. The movies of the individual heroes were far and away better than the avengers. It just wasn't put together well.

2012-07-22,"Actor John Cusack once said that there are no more big production studios anymore. There are just a bunch of banks which provide funding/credits for projects and approve which script would be produced according to box office profit it is projected to generate. ( because Hollywood mentality became like : more money , bigger stars , bigger budget , bigger marketing , bigger blockbuster , bigger box office income that's all it matters ) Since comicbook / superhero genre is the newest and biggest market to be milked in popular culture for Hollywood in these harsh economy ; is it surprising that The Avengers , a childish intake about a bunch of ridiculously costumed ""Superheroes"" with one dimensional immature behavior getting together to repel an alien invasion ( AGAIN ! I think any actual alien seeing these alien invasion movies would not even close Earth ever again. Our ""always winning despite odds"" thing would be silly to them ) ? Unfortunetely not. This is another shallow seasonal product , another ""leave your brain at theater door"" movie aimed for Comic Con Convention fans. And I admit it is a BIG market.Just like most movies in this genre ( there are a few exceptions ) it has its own cliché's and tropes like they are coming out of a factory assembly line. At least director Joss Whedon ( a great TV writer/producer. I was a follower of Firefly and Dollhouse ) does not deny them and recognizing what they are , wears them at movie's sleeve. Bickering superheroes ( that's fine amusing with Whedonesque humor but humor got overwhelming and made ""superheroes"" childlike not multi dimensional characters ) , threat from outer space from a sneering arrogant enemy with another comic book costume ( at least Tom Hiddleston performed as well as he could with material he was given , but what the hell was Loki's motivation in conquering Earth ? ) , his boss with a digital voice , super secret ( American as usual ) military spy agency ( I can never understand American film industry's fetish of military - for a nation devoid of conscription ) , national stereotypes ( Russians are evil you know ) , hot ass kicking super agent babes ( Scarlett , Scarlett are you so desperate ? ) , Aryan looking superheroes from WW2 era ( Thor , Captain America , blond blue eyed , with whom we were fighting with anyway in that time ? Did you realize that there were no other ethnicity among these heroes like Oriental or Latin ) , Tony Stark rich jerk , Hulk a Doctor Bruce Banner marked with tragedy ( Mark Ruffolo is the only actor with proper character material and performs admirably in this ) , Hawkeye with baby faced Jeremy Renner ( I never warmed to that guy as an actor ) , and Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury big boss of agency with an eye patch ( no fake protez in nowadays ? ) because it looks cool , a final battle with lots of laser rays and CGI explosions without casualties in another American urban area ( this year it is New York City's trashing time ) , good vs evil , government made the mistake of launching a nuclear missile , it is averted , heroes are victorious blah blah it is the end....After all this sequence of predictable events where no protagonist was harmed and good guys win , what do we have ? An empty blockbuster which will make a big Box Office hit , probably a franchise but at the end an empty film. I can not wait in 20-30 years our grandchildren asking ""Is this the stuff your generation was watching ?

2019-06-26,"This is one of the best films I've ever seen, not just because it's a fun action film, filled with characters that I've grown to love, but because it was the first of its kind, setting the bar for other multiple-character franchises. It's a first, and because of this it absolutely has its flaws, but it's definitely a game changer.Despite having seven lead characters (counting all Avengers plus Loki), everyone got at least a few moments of screen time devoted to their development. With seven leads, that's pretty amazing. We have the quiet moments, the little gestures and phrases that have been picked apart time and again by the fans that have granted a depth to the film that wouldn't have been possible if this were the first time we met any of these characters, and that's the real beauty of Avengers. It's a team-up flick, but it's a team-up of characters we've all been introduced to before. (Even if you hadn't seen any of the previous films, there was a sort of pop culture awareness around most of them by the time it was released that you'd be hard pressed to go in blind about anyone except the characters who didn't have their own film yet and were, however regrettably, less important because of it.)Combine that with a well-loved director who isn't afraid to sucker punch his audience, and you've got a perfect mix for a film that doesn't just thrill audiences with fight scenes that are larger-than-life, but gets people to invest emotionally in a fictional world. Avengers was released more than two years ago, but the film is still being picked apart and very much alive in the hearts and minds of the fans because of Marvel's expert world-building. In every show, every film, you see threads that lead back (or forward) to other events in the Universe, and it's this sort of continuity that the fans love. They pick up on every little reference, read into every word of dialogue, every prop placement, every choice that the creative team makes, and this is what has made Avengers so successful. It stands up to that test, and even with ten films under Marvel's belt, there's still very few inconsistencies. (Especially when you compare it to the next largest Marvel franchise, X-Men, which has some major timeline problems around Wolverine.)All in all, this is a film that should be in every collection because it's not just great, it's revolutionary.",10.0,2019-06,Wednesday,"about:0.03, absolutely:0.06, action:0.02, again:0.04, all:0.08, amazing:0.04, and:0.17, any:0.07, anyone:0.05, are:0.02, around:0.10, at:0.03, audience:0.05, avengers:0.09, back:0.04, be:0.05, because:0.21, been:0.10, before:0.04, being:0.04, best:0.03, but:0.10, by:0.06, character:0.03, characters:0.13, definitely:0.05, depth:0.06, development:0.05, dialogue:0.05, didn:0.04, director:0.04, doesn:0.05, especially:0.05, even:0.06, ever:0.04, every:0.27, everyone:0.04, fans:0.14, few:0.09, fight:0.04, film:0.18, films:0.11, first:0.10, for:0.04, franchise:0.06, fun:0.04, gets:0.05, go:0.04, got:0.09, great:0.03, hard:0.05, has:0.08, have:0.12, having:0.05, his:0.03, however:0.05, if:0.06, in:0.13, into:0.04, is:0.07, isn:0.05, it:0.23, its:0.07, just:0.08, kind:0.05, least:0.05, less:0.05, life:0.05, little:0.08, loki:0.03, love:0.09, loved:0.05, made:0.03, makes:0.04, marvel:0.08, moments:0.09, more:0.03, most:0.03, much:0.03, next:0.05, not:0.05, of:0.24, on:0.02, one:0.02, or:0.03, other:0.06, own:0.04, people:0.04, perfect:0.04, pretty:0.05, previous:0.05, read:0.06, real:0.05, scenes:0.04, screen:0.04, see:0.03, seen:0.07, should:0.04, show:0.05, so:0.03, some:0.03, still:0.08, team:0.12, than:0.06, that:0.28, the:0.29, their:0.06, them:0.03, there:0.05, these:0.04, they:0.03, this:0.10, time:0.11, to:0.16, two:0.04, universe:0.05, up:0.12, ve:0.17, very:0.06, was:0.08, we:0.11, well:0.03, were:0.06, what:0.03, when:0.03, which:0.03, who:0.06, with:0.10, world:0.08, years:0.04, yet:0.05, you:0.12"
2012-04-28,"To start with i new what to expect a lot of action involving hi-tech gadgets and weapons off-course stark(Downy Jr.) was excellent among the avengers with others acting tough and super-hero's unless there's an exception that is banner(Mark Ruffalo) when he was not the other guy. I think it couldn't have been done any better then this,like the cast itself being heavy and the expectations and hype added it has to be presented with perfection,apart from the loud bangs and crazy clashes between the avengers every other 5 minute which was quiet fun to watch indeed but the lack of story telling again over here kept me silent for a while and gaze only at the screen discovering in this case suddenly a stunt double instead of a black widow(Scarlett Johanson) now that kept me even more silent only later to learn the movie is full of error's here and there in the background but when the action in the middle is just to intense to observe the sides i know who cares.(i got bad seats BTW) the earlier reviews highlight the emerging and graphic part of the film which i must say were amazing and a lot of new stuff to see.To conclude in the end the movie is designed as a summer blockbuster with marvels best joining hands together and fighting the evil Loki who's job is to make people obey and worship him.So in the end a movie you would go to and enjoy from the start till the end only to walk out thinking...yeah! we have advanced in terms of making action/sci-fi movie",7.0,2012-04,Saturday,"acting:0.06, action:0.10, again:0.06, amazing:0.06, an:0.04, and:0.28, any:0.05, as:0.03, at:0.04, avengers:0.07, bad:0.06, banner:0.06, be:0.03, been:0.05, being:0.06, best:0.04, better:0.05, between:0.06, black:0.05, blockbuster:0.08, but:0.06, cast:0.06, couldn:0.08, course:0.07, done:0.06, end:0.18, enjoy:0.07, even:0.05, every:0.06, evil:0.08, excellent:0.07, expect:0.08, expectations:0.08, fighting:0.08, film:0.04, for:0.03, from:0.08, full:0.08, fun:0.06, go:0.06, got:0.07, guy:0.07, has:0.04, have:0.07, he:0.04, here:0.12, hero:0.06, him:0.06, hype:0.08, in:0.16, instead:0.09, is:0.12, it:0.05, itself:0.08, job:0.06, jr:0.05, just:0.04, know:0.06, like:0.04, loki:0.05, lot:0.12, make:0.05, making:0.07, mark:0.05, me:0.09, more:0.04, movie:0.11, must:0.06, new:0.12, not:0.03, now:0.06, of:0.16, off:0.06, only:0.15, other:0.09, others:0.07, out:0.04, over:0.06, part:0.07, people:0.06, reviews:0.08, ruffalo:0.05, say:0.05, scarlett:0.06, screen:0.05, see:0.04, so:0.04, stark:0.06, start:0.15, story:0.04, stuff:0.09, summer:0.08, super:0.06, that:0.06, the:0.49, then:0.06, there:0.08, think:0.05, this:0.05, to:0.29, together:0.05, was:0.09, watch:0.05, we:0.05, were:0.05, what:0.04, when:0.09, which:0.10, while:0.07, who:0.09, widow:0.05, with:0.12, would:0.05, you:0.03"

2024-09-03,"Marvel's first big event!!! The first 20 minutes of this movie are so good; the reintroduction of the characters was a really cool and creative choice. Marvel has become something that I really don't care about, but every time I rewatch this movie, I instantly get retransported into the golden days.The avenegrs follow a simple plot, unlike movies like etenals, where you need to have seen 20 movies to understand one character. The movie seamlessly integrates each story into a single, massive blockbuster. The Avengers was my most highly anticipated movie for phases 1 and 2.My only problem with this film was the screen time felt very split, so there wasn't really a main character. I mean, the film feels like a chefs kiss when it comes to comic book cinema. Each hero brings something unique to the table: Iron Man is the comedic relay character, and Thor is this godlike being. Hawkeye is a hero turned villain; Hulk smashes; however, Banner brings emotion to the table, Cap brings bravery and hope, and Black Widow brings style to the film. I think this film is very fairly rated; however, there are some reviews that I dont understand the ratings for. Seeing all the heroes fight together in NYC was just an utimant MCU moment.Loki is a great villain and is very threating. Tom is great as Loki, and he plays this chilidish character who seeks one thing...power. I will give Thor credit for giving a good entrance to Loki, and I think I like how this movie reintroduces him.Nick Fury is played by the amazing Samuel L. Jackson, and he is the thread that ties the Avengers together. In all of these Avenegrs films, there is a threat, the heroes are recreated, and the final hour is dedicated to a fight scene. I dont like how they just brush off the attack of NYC post-avengers; if this actually happened, it would be a good 40 years before the world decided to move on.The battle of NCY is by far the best scene in this movie, and I love the lizard designs as well. I am a nerd, so of course I am going to love this movie, just because of how simplistic it is. This might just be the only good movie Joss Whedon has directed.

2012-05-11,"Special effects, action scenes, sound, humor, acting all is great as expected from such blockbusters. However, dare not expect much in the realm of coherence. One can argue that surrealism and fantasy is at the core of the Marvel Comics experience. However, some people expect a degree of reality to mix with the fiction, which is where ""magic"" happens and classics are made. The enemies that the heroes must face look a lot like video game characters, mindlessly going about their do-harm business for no other reason other than that they are ""bad"". The tactics employed by the enemies are laughable and their strategy non existent. One would expect more of these enemies, especially considering that they are supposed to be so technologically advanced.

2013-12-24,"This is one of those movies that has both good points and bad points. For starters, I thought ""Iron Man"" (Robert Downey Jr.) and ""the Hulk"" (Mark Ruffalo) were absolutely sensational. Likewise, most of the other characters were well played too. On the flip-side though the introduction of ""Hawkeye"" (Jeremy Renner) was terribly planned and presented. Not only was the character development badly mishandled but the fact that this person got so much screen time when there were others with much better credentials just boggles the mind. Not only that but his costume-or basic lack thereof-also stuck out like a sore thumb. Additionally, although I liked the CGI I thought it and the non-stop action were just too overwhelming. Even more important was the fact that there were too many characters and not enough film to go around between them. This made the film look extremely uneven. Too many cooks do indeed spoil the soup. Be that as it may, this movie should have been very good but in all frankness it turned out to be a jumbled mess. All things considered then I think the really good points were dragged down by the lack of direction which resulted in a very mediocre film.

2012-04-27,"Having cracked the problem of super-hero movies with successful runs on Spider-Man and X-Men (both franchises contracted out to major studios), Marvel went independent with assorted features based on their lesser known characters - Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and Captain America - and did very well with a series of one-off movies which were commercially and critically well received. Importantly, these movies were conceived, from the very start, as essential building blocks moving towards this film, which achieves a cinematic first by bringing together a number of characters who have headlined their own movies and who now appear together (OK, so I'm ignoring Abbott and Castello's role in bringing together Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and the Wolfman. So sue me).The problem was always going to be how to deal with bringing together such powerful characters in a team movie when every one of them is a strong enough character to have carried his own movie - surely either they are all downgraded to sidekicks of each other? Or else the movie will be nothing but a testosterone-fulled p*ss*ng contest? It turns out that it is both these things, but the mix is beautifully judged. By entrusting the script and direction to Joss Whedon - ace script doctor, master at working with ensemble pieces, and lifelong comic lover (and excellent comic writer, one might also add), the balance - for balance was always going to be critical in this movie - is perfect.I won't say anything very much about the content, because there is so much in this movie to enjoy. It is simply full of small touches among the bombast, which will bring delight to the average viewer who likes an action-packed blockbuster, and absolute joy to comic lovers. The characters which have been established in the previous movies are all here, and they are all the same people - they haven't been changed for The Avengers, but they have more depth and there is also character development here. The script is terrific and the action is stunning. Oh, and hang on until after the main titles have finished at the end...By the way, thank you so much for saddling this movie in the UK with the ridiculous title ""Marvel Avengers Assemble"" (which communicates even less to a non-comics audience than ""The Avengers"") and also depriving us of the iconic Avengers logo and title on the main title screen.",10.0,2012-04,Friday,"about:0.03, action:0.05, after:0.04, all:0.07, also:0.11, always:0.11, america:0.03, an:0.03, and:0.30, anything:0.05, are:0.08, as:0.03, assemble:0.06, at:0.06, audience:0.06, avengers:0.10, be:0.08, because:0.04, been:0.08, blockbuster:0.06, both:0.11, bring:0.06, but:0.07, by:0.10, captain:0.03, character:0.07, characters:0.12, cinematic:0.06, comic:0.12, comics:0.05, depth:0.07, development:0.06, did:0.04, each:0.04, else:0.06, end:0.05, enjoy:0.05, enough:0.05, ensemble:0.07, even:0.04, every:0.04, excellent:0.06, film:0.03, first:0.04, for:0.07, from:0.03, full:0.06, going:0.09, have:0.13, haven:0.06, having:0.06, here:0.09, hero:0.05, his:0.03, how:0.04, hulk:0.03, in:0.12, iron:0.03, is:0.17, it:0.06, joss:0.04, less:0.06, main:0.11, man:0.06, marvel:0.06, me:0.03, might:0.06, more:0.03, movie:0.12, movies:0.15, much:0.11, nothing:0.05, now:0.05, of:0.13, off:0.05, on:0.11, one:0.08, or:0.03, other:0.03, out:0.06, own:0.10, packed:0.06, people:0.04, perfect:0.05, previous:0.05, role:0.06, same:0.05, say:0.04, screen:0.04, script:0.16, series:0.06, simply:0.06, so:0.12, start:0.06, such:0.05, super:0.04, team:0.04, than:0.04, that:0.02, the:0.43, their:0.07, them:0.04, there:0.06, these:0.08, they:0.12, things:0.05, this:0.08, thor:0.03, to:0.20, together:0.14, until:0.06, us:0.06, very:0.11, was:0.05, way:0.04, well:0.06, went:0.06, were:0.07, whedon:0.04, when:0.04, which:0.19, who:0.11, will:0.07, with:0.14, won:0.07, you:0.03"
2012-04-30,"Firstly, I have seen this movie twice already and this is THE BEST Marvel movie, anybody else that says otherwise is either out of his mind, lying or hasn't seen the movie yet.You may think that in a movie that consists of four characters who have their own franchise would do injustice to the two new characters in the movie, think again.... Black Widow and Hawkeye also have their time on the screen. But of course the best lines go to Iron Man and the most epic fight scenes go to the Hulk.After watching the two Hulk movies I was a little disappointed only to the extent that they show him as this destructive and out of control monster which he is. But this movie makes you sympathize with him and even make you like him. In fact I felt that the fight scenes involving The Hulk were the best in the whole movie, followed by Iron man! I won hide the fact that I am a huge Batman fan, I find Nolan's movies head and shoulder's over other movies, but this movie is up in the same league. Highly polished character screen presence, well directed, amazingly witty, very very funny and above all visually captivating. I felt the run time was a little short actually. I just didn't want it to end. Considering people were clapping and yelling out their approval for some of the movie's topnotch scenes this movie will be a huge blockbuster which it thoroughly deserves to be. I am predicting it will be the next 1 billion grosser!!! This movie just raised the bar to a whole new level for Marvel movies. Seriously I was more eager for the release of The Dark Knight Rises but wow! What a show by Marvel and I would say full credit to Joss Whedon. You sir are just outstanding... The movie was tight and it didn't have any loose ends worth mentioning. First my favorite series of all time Firefly, now this, thank you, Joss Whedon!!! That was a mind-blowing movie.

2012-05-13,"I'm giving no spoilers here since I am wanting to make anybody who hasn't seen this movie to go hit the movie theaters ASAP. Needless to say, The Avengers is everything you want and more in a superhero blockbuster flick. MARVEL truly put a lot of effort into this movie and it really does show a lot. They not only did a huge team up movie, but they also created one that was deep, compelling and brilliantly done. Every hero we've seen in this movie is given not only a fair amount of time on screen as a group, but each one also individually. We see their struggles with their times as a superhero and each one of them has an arc of their own. Even some of the side characters get their own fair share of screen time and I for one applaud that. The action scenes are beautifully well done in this movie and some of the best I've seen in a superhero flick; especially the final battle. Not only does this movie succeed in also being strong in character development and action, but its humor is also top notch. I burst out laughing at a lot of those funny moments and I think you will too when you see them. There is a lot of eye candy to behold in the movie as well and everything looks brilliant and feels brilliant. I'm not going to go into more of this movie so I don't dare spoil anything for you all, but it has to be said right now. The Avengers is quite possibly the best movie of 2012 I've ever seen.

2012-06-05,"'Avengers Assemble' has been smashing the box offices all around the world! It is tipped to be one of the highest grossing films of all time! The film has been strongly anticipated by 'Marvel' fans worldwide, who stuck on through the credits of the original character films to see 'Nick Fury' (played by Samuel L. Jackson) hint at the upcoming film.The film itself has certainly lived up to the hype, the cast is superb with an all star cast including; Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Chris Hemsworth, Samuel L. Jackson and Gwyneth Paltrow. It also includes new up and comers; Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner and Tom Hiddleston.In the very beginning it is quite dull but it gets progressively better and better as it goes along! The cast all work together really well and there are tonnes of laughs and shining moments! Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man/Tony Stark) is definitely one of the shining stars. Downey Jr. and Johansson were the best of the bunch; they both did some fantastic acting and were absolutely hilarious! Chris Evans (Captain America/Steve Rogers) annoyed me because his character is very cocky and relatively boring yet he got quite a lot of screen time?The film has its up's and it has its minor down's but overall the film was fantastic and I really enjoyed watching it, I'm sure there will be a sequel, here's hoping it's as good as this!",9.0,2012-06,Tuesday,"absolutely:0.08, acting:0.06, all:0.12, along:0.08, also:0.05, america:0.04, an:0.04, and:0.25, are:0.03, around:0.07, as:0.10, assemble:0.08, at:0.04, avengers:0.03, be:0.07, because:0.05, been:0.10, beginning:0.08, best:0.04, better:0.11, boring:0.08, both:0.07, but:0.06, by:0.08, captain:0.04, cast:0.18, certainly:0.08, character:0.09, chris:0.18, credits:0.08, definitely:0.07, did:0.05, down:0.07, downey:0.15, enjoyed:0.07, evans:0.13, fans:0.06, fantastic:0.14, film:0.18, films:0.10, fury:0.06, gets:0.07, goes:0.08, good:0.04, got:0.07, has:0.20, he:0.04, hemsworth:0.06, here:0.06, hiddleston:0.06, his:0.04, hype:0.08, in:0.03, iron:0.04, is:0.12, it:0.19, its:0.10, itself:0.08, jackson:0.13, jeremy:0.07, johansson:0.13, jr:0.16, lot:0.06, man:0.04, mark:0.05, marvel:0.04, me:0.04, moments:0.07, new:0.06, nick:0.06, of:0.16, on:0.03, one:0.07, original:0.09, overall:0.07, played:0.07, quite:0.14, really:0.09, renner:0.07, robert:0.10, ruffalo:0.05, samuel:0.13, scarlett:0.06, screen:0.05, see:0.04, sequel:0.08, some:0.04, star:0.08, stark:0.06, stars:0.08, sure:0.07, the:0.37, there:0.08, they:0.04, this:0.02, through:0.07, time:0.08, to:0.07, together:0.05, tom:0.06, tony:0.06, up:0.13, very:0.09, was:0.03, watching:0.06, well:0.04, were:0.09, who:0.05, will:0.04, with:0.03, work:0.06, world:0.06, yet:0.07"
2023-02-26,"11 years ago, the film was released that brought together all the heroes that follow in the previous films of this universe. But, is the movie still as good as it was in 2012? In my opinion, he was much better in the old days. This movie seems to get worse over the years. It is a good movie, but in my memory it was a great movie, however, after rewatching it I ended up realizing that it ends up failing a lot in some aspects. The film is a little dragging at times and maybe that's the film's real problem. But, like I said, it's a good movie and has a very interesting comedy. Also, the chemistry of the characters is really good.

The casting of the Hulk was impeccable, they truly could not have chosen a more perfect actor than Mark Ruffalo for this role, he portrays Banner in a way that would have made Bill Bixby proud and had they cast him in the previous Hulk films I'd have two additional movies on my shelf, but I digress. Robert Downy Jr., as usual, brought the most amazing array of sarcasm and wit to the screen, his audacity always has just the right amount of pluck and pomp to press all the right buttons while tip toeing playfully on all the wrong ones.

2012-06-07,"I'm still having my fingers crossed that the Avengers will overtake Avatar as the most successful movie ever (until another movie burst and takes over that is). It would be such a great success and I would be so happy for Joss Wheddon. A real nerd amongst filmmakers he has made it big time. As we speak Avengers has broken quite a few records already and it is on a good roll. And all that is more than deserved. While I don't think it is necessary to have watched the other Marvel movies so far (especially not the different Hulks), the Avengers will make you want to watch more (look at your local video store for confirmation!).All the characters are here and have their moments. Maybe Thor is the one that gets a bit shorthanded time wise. But then again, he is god, so he wouldn't care anyway. Mark Ruffalo is winning (as a Charlie Sheen would say) with his performance as Hulk/Bruce Banner. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is entertaining as ever. And even if some claim that Captain America is not needed, I think he brings Gravitas and is more than valuable to counter the jokes of an Iron Man and bring some much needed bonding to the whole Crew. Chris Evans is perfect for that role.The movie has been criticized for the weak villain. I think that does injustice to the movie. While the characters (bar Hulk?) have been introduced to you, this still is a forming of a group. It is more about the Avengers, than it is about any villain. And I don't think Tom H. Loki is that weak (even if Hulk does disagree).I watched the movie twice now and I enjoyed it both times. Time flies by and you don't realize how fast 150 minutes can go by. I like the fact, that Joss does not treat the viewer as if he were stupid. So maybe some will not get the joke/bet between Capt. Americas character and Sam Jacksons character (though I reckon it won't be many), but I loved that the movie did not make a big deal out of it.Since this is a Marvel movie, you should know by now that there is a tag scene coming at the end. A friend of mine knew immediately what (or rather who) we saw there. You'll find the answer on the internet. That scene came in between the credits. There is another scene after the credits which as of yet, was not shown in Europe, but will hopefully make its way onto a digital release (DVD, Blu Ray or whatever comes next). I'm so looking forward to it ... oh and the 3D is nice, but its the story/characters and everything else that will sell you to the movie ...",9.0,2012-06,Thursday,"3d:0.05, about:0.06, after:0.04, again:0.04, all:0.04, already:0.05, america:0.03, an:0.03, and:0.21, another:0.09, any:0.03, are:0.02, as:0.17, at:0.05, avengers:0.08, banner:0.04, be:0.07, been:0.06, between:0.08, big:0.07, bit:0.04, both:0.05, bring:0.05, brings:0.05, bruce:0.04, but:0.08, by:0.08, came:0.05, can:0.03, captain:0.03, care:0.06, character:0.06, characters:0.08, chris:0.04, comes:0.05, coming:0.05, credits:0.11, did:0.03, different:0.05, does:0.11, don:0.10, downey:0.03, else:0.05, end:0.04, enjoyed:0.05, entertaining:0.04, especially:0.04, evans:0.04, even:0.06, ever:0.07, everything:0.04, fact:0.05, far:0.04, few:0.04, find:0.05, for:0.08, get:0.03, gets:0.05, go:0.04, god:0.05, good:0.03, great:0.03, group:0.05, has:0.08, have:0.07, having:0.05, he:0.14, here:0.04, his:0.03, how:0.03, hulk:0.07, if:0.08, in:0.03, iron:0.05, is:0.31, it:0.16, its:0.07, joss:0.07, jr:0.03, know:0.04, like:0.02, ll:0.05, loki:0.03, look:0.05, looking:0.05, loved:0.05, made:0.03, make:0.10, man:0.05, many:0.04, mark:0.03, marvel:0.05, maybe:0.10, minutes:0.05, moments:0.04, more:0.11, most:0.03, movie:0.14, movies:0.03, much:0.03, my:0.03, next:0.05, nice:0.06, not:0.13, now:0.08, of:0.08, on:0.05, one:0.02, or:0.06, other:0.03, out:0.03, over:0.04, perfect:0.04, performance:0.05, quite:0.05, rather:0.06, real:0.05, robert:0.03, role:0.05, ruffalo:0.03, saw:0.05, say:0.04, scene:0.12, should:0.04, since:0.04, so:0.12, some:0.08, still:0.08, story:0.03, such:0.04, takes:0.05, than:0.09, that:0.23, the:0.39, their:0.03, then:0.04, there:0.08, think:0.14, this:0.03, thor:0.03, though:0.04, time:0.08, times:0.05, to:0.12, tom:0.04, until:0.05, villain:0.08, want:0.04, was:0.02, watch:0.03, watched:0.09, way:0.03, we:0.07, were:0.03, what:0.03, which:0.03, while:0.08, who:0.03, whole:0.04, will:0.14, with:0.02, won:0.06, would:0.09, yet:0.05, you:0.13, your:0.04"
2012-04-29,"Rating: 4/5 | Super's epic adventure.The Avengers or Avengers Assemble is an eagerly anticipated Superhero film in 2012, which is written and directed by a cult film maker Joss Whedon, based on Marvel/DC superhero comics 'The Avengers' by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Starring Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, and Samuel L. Jackson. The Avengers 2012 is the best and most entertaining Marvel Superhero films ever made for Super-fans and others. This movie truly fulfills audience expectations till the end.I am not going to talk about the story here, because who cares about the script; it's just Supers at all. However it's a typical superhero plot where the group of American Superheroes are assembled together for a highly complicated mission and saving the earth from the bad guys who take over the world. What else it could be, it's understood that always Hollywood saves the world from bad guys. In this film Hollywood collaborates with Marvel comics and bringing together six of Marvel's superheroes including Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow to face the supervillain Demi god, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). It is the best sequel ever made for Iron Man and Hulk. Especially the Incredible Hulk is the most Incredible vital character in this film. The second half of the film is moving fast due to the unlimited action sequences including motion captured CGI monster Hulk's smash-ups, O.M.G. I can't believe that this film made the Incredible smile! And he also makes you produce laughter.The special effects and motion captured CGI are highly impressive and nevertheless the stunning action choreography is highly potential till the climatic battle. Overall everybody had done a good performance, in particular the interesting member in the crew Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) performance is good and holding the attention unique with wit. The Director and co-writer Joss Whedon has done a great job. Even though the script is not complicated much but he had constructed the characters well in the script and also he had changed their characteristics a bit like the Hulk. He had given everyone an equal opportunity in the film and made everyone radically distinctive in their skills. There is a bit of humor in this film, slapstick gags which is handled well and everybody enjoyed throughout the film. However, director Joss Whedon is quite innovative with unique comedy, and special effects which is always helping the narrative move forward. The protracted conversation for superheroes could have been avoided in the film; people won't expect the superhero to talk, so in my opinion don't make them talk much in the script.Result: The Avengers is a Superhero film with dramatic action, thrilling adventure, fun, alien invasion, superheroes with super powers including ridiculous costumes and accessories, unbeatable smash-up collisions, high-tension action sequences with the spectacular special effects which are all combined together and leading us to the happy ending. Its truly worth watching and highly recommended for Marvel fans and Super-fans.The Avengers: A-vengeance in 3DSunday, April 29, 2012",8.0,2012-04,Sunday,"2012:0.12, about:0.05, action:0.07, alien:0.04, all:0.03, also:0.05, always:0.07, am:0.04, america:0.02, an:0.04, and:0.27, are:0.06, assemble:0.04, at:0.02, audience:0.04, avengers:0.11, bad:0.07, battle:0.04, be:0.02, because:0.03, been:0.03, believe:0.04, best:0.05, bit:0.07, black:0.03, but:0.02, by:0.05, can:0.02, captain:0.02, cgi:0.07, character:0.02, characters:0.02, chris:0.07, comedy:0.04, comics:0.07, could:0.06, director:0.07, don:0.03, done:0.07, downey:0.06, earth:0.03, effects:0.08, else:0.04, end:0.03, enjoyed:0.04, entertaining:0.04, epic:0.04, especially:0.04, evans:0.03, even:0.03, ever:0.06, everyone:0.07, expect:0.04, expectations:0.04, face:0.05, fans:0.11, film:0.22, films:0.03, for:0.08, from:0.04, fun:0.03, given:0.04, god:0.04, going:0.03, good:0.04, great:0.02, group:0.04, guys:0.09, had:0.10, half:0.04, has:0.02, have:0.02, hawkeye:0.03, he:0.09, hemsworth:0.04, here:0.03, hiddleston:0.07, high:0.04, highly:0.18, hollywood:0.09, however:0.07, hulk:0.10, humor:0.04, impressive:0.05, in:0.18, incredible:0.11, interesting:0.04, iron:0.07, is:0.19, it:0.07, its:0.03, jackson:0.03, jeremy:0.04, job:0.03, johansson:0.03, joss:0.08, jr:0.06, just:0.02, like:0.02, loki:0.02, made:0.11, make:0.03, makes:0.03, man:0.06, mark:0.03, marvel:0.11, most:0.05, movie:0.01, much:0.05, my:0.02, not:0.04, of:0.05, on:0.02, opinion:0.04, or:0.02, others:0.04, over:0.03, overall:0.04, people:0.03, performance:0.09, plot:0.03, powers:0.05, quite:0.04, rating:0.04, renner:0.04, robert:0.06, ruffalo:0.03, samuel:0.04, scarlett:0.03, script:0.15, second:0.04, sequel:0.04, sequences:0.08, so:0.02, special:0.09, spectacular:0.05, story:0.02, super:0.13, superhero:0.15, superheroes:0.12, take:0.04, that:0.03, the:0.50, their:0.05, them:0.02, there:0.02, this:0.07, thor:0.02, though:0.04, throughout:0.05, to:0.06, together:0.08, tom:0.07, truly:0.09, up:0.02, us:0.04, watching:0.03, well:0.05, what:0.02, whedon:0.08, where:0.03, which:0.11, who:0.05, widow:0.03, with:0.10, won:0.05, world:0.06, worth:0.04, written:0.04, you:0.02"
2015-03-22,"The Avengers – an Ensnarement of Action by Evan Wingenbach Joss Whedon's ""The Avengers"" has received loads of appraisal for its glorious battles and epic action. It's a movie that's easy to market and easy to make money but nothing really special. Filled with mindless battle sequences, that certainly gives the awe experience, but nothing more. A classic case of a big budget meant to have big hype and big profit.The conflict in the story is quickly established in the opening scene when the tesseract a cube of pure power unleashes a portal and out comes Loki the banished demigod half-brother of Thor. Loki steals the tesseract planning to use its power to open a portal unleashing an alien army on earth. This gives the movie the breathtakingly simple plot, stop Loki or the world will end. The rest of the movie involves 5 super heroes (Captain America, Iron Man, The Hulk, Thor, and Black Widow) plus another that spends most of the movie brainwashed on Loki's side (Hawkeye). These super heroes come together throughout the movie slinging backhanded remarks at each other making them joss Whedon's ultimate dysfunctional Family. Especially between Captain America and Tony Stark there is strong tension, but of course in the end the all put their differences aside and use their different but still the same skills together to save humanity. What a predictable ""story book"" finish.The biggest problem is that the movie really has no suspense. Never throughout the movie is there a doubt in your mind that the avengers will succeed. They are given a basic but serious conflict and they just blow right through it with little to no complications. A giant alien snake comes out of the portal to wreak havoc; no problem the hulk will kill it with a single punch. The government is going to Nuke the populated city to try and cut their losses to only New York, hey don't worry iron man will just fly the nuke into the portal and use it on the aliens, but instead of just throwing the missile in the portal I'll fly all the way in with it that way it's a bit more dramatic (insert eye roll here).The whole movie leading up to the end they are building up that Loki is more powerful than he seems and that it's going to take a miracle to defeat him. This attempt at suspense would maybe work if it wasn't just one big lie. This would be suspense dies in seconds during one of the most anticlimactic villain fights of all time (rivaling the death of Smaug in the Hobbit). The Hulk approaches Loki and you start to feel hey this is it the big Loki fight then in a blink of an eye this thought is killed while the Hulk flings Loki around like an overcooked noodle completely demolishing him and leaving him unable to move and for all intends and purposes defeated. Apparently it was that easy Overall the movie has no real plot. It's a simple plot that a 10 year old could've written. There is no real suspense just consistently reassured fact that the avengers kick-ass. The creators of this film basically just made up for what they lacked in actual movie plot with breathtaking action to keep you excited and entertained and to make you not realize that there really isn't much there. If you want to sit back, not put much thought in and just enjoy some crazy action and some try hard comedy this is the movie for you.

2012-04-27,"Just came back from watching The Avengers. Awesome , epic, cool, outstanding, fantastic etc. Looks like for almost the whole year of me waiting to watch movie and all the hype that they built up was worth the waitTom Hiddleston as Loki is as evil as ever but it would have been great if more villains had shown up along the way. Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton/Hawkeye was the surprising character for me since I never expected him to turn evil but he was definitely the right man chosen for the role. Scarlett Johansson was beautifully stunning as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Thor was great and surprisingly gave The Hulk a run for his money (something which I didn't quite expect to see). Speaking of Hulk, Mark Ruffalo was well suited to play Bruce Banner/Hulk (although Norton was better in my opinion). Cobie Smulders as Maria Hills was a bit of a let down since I expected more screen time for her. Samuel L. Jackson was OK as Nick Fury. Robert Downey Jr. is as goofy as ever as Tony Stark/Iron Man but for me the biggest driving force of the entire movie has got to none other than Chris Evan's awesome acting as Steve Rogers/Captain America. He was in my opinion the biggest star of the film in my opinion and really made the team come together as one. The plot was very simple and straightforward but the action scenes and dram was what made the movie really interesting. Who says that the movie needs to have a good storyline in order for the film to be great. The movie itself doesn't necessary require story background for the characters at all since they were all already told in their own separate movies respectivelyOn a note to those who have been complaining on the film for being mindless boring etc. My question is, what did you expect from a superhero movie? This movie is all about action and it was made to be entertaining and fun to watch, not for you to sit and expect a twisty kind of turn story like TDK. The main reason why people go watch is because they wanted to see their favorite main heroes from different franchise team up together in the same movie. Thats all that is and to me, that isn't a bad thing at allI have a degree in film and video (majoring animation if you're wondering) but I still find this movie really good. If you guys are looking for something else beyond action in this film, then you guys are in the wrong place All in all, an epic film which definitely deserves to be ranked in the IMDb top 100 movie list and definitely above TDK. This is one movie which I will surely go and see againOn A Final Note :- KUDOS TO JOSS WHEDON AND THE ENTIRE CREW FOR MAKING AN AWESOME SUPERHERO FILM.

2013-06-02,"I don't think I need to re-hash the plot details with 1000 reviews before me. In short, the Avengers come together, at first they don't like each other, but they band together to save the world from aliens. The technical gadgets and space craft were cool and looked great on the big screen. However, with so many main characters and so much action to fit in, the funny, quirky, bits about each character were lost. Everyone got in a one liner, but not much more than that. I missed the heart pounding heavy metal arrogance of Iron Man, the fish out of water grandeur of Thor and even the mysterious plot line of Captain America. With all the fab reviews, I must just have different taste in movies. I felt less endless battles and more banter and purpose would have jazzed this up a bit.

The acting is so perfect and the plot was also amazing. The action was unbelievable and the effects were outstanding!!!! I love this movie and have high respect for everyone involved in the making. The Incredible Hulk was portrayed exactly as he should be, just pure rage and outbursts of anger. The Iron Man was super funny and really cool too, as always. Captain America isn't my favorite, he's kind of lame. Hawkeye is also very cool, but I wish he had an actual superpower, like agility or something. Black Widow is awesome, but she wasn't used to her fullest abilities in this movie. Thor is also very cool, but should have been used a little more in this movie.

2012-05-12,"I'm not gonna lie, this movie was absolutely amazing! Also, if I'm being completely honest, I went in assuming it would be another highly overrated superhero movie that couldn't like up to the hype. It definitely wouldn't be the first time I disagreed with the critics. Boy was I mistaken. Outside of the films from Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, this is easily the best superhero movie ever made. They plot developed perfectly, the action sequences were incredible, there were a lot of unexpectedly humorous scenes and dialogue, and the characters and actors were all great. One of my concerns going in was how they would possibly give each character their fair shake. Well the great Joss Whedon did a great job keeping a perfect balance between staying true to the individual characters while further introducing a developing Black Widow and Hawkeye. Another thing, Mark Ruffalo did a marvelous job as Bruce Banner. A lot of people were worried about him in that role and were upset about the change from Edward Norton. Maybe it's because I'm biased and loathe Norton but I thought Ruffalo did a better job as Banner. I wouldn't have minded them focusing a little more time on the Hawkeye character and I wouldn't have minded if they actually squeezed in Natalie Portman's character for a quick scene or two but the movie really didn't need it. I just think if you can put Portman on screen, you put Portman on screen, lol. I also wouldn't have minded if they focused a bit more on the villainous pawns and where they come from but I have a feeling we'll find out more about them in the following Avengers sequels so I can't be too upset about that.

2012-12-18,"OK, now although I thought this movie was good, the two things that kept annoying me every time I had to stare at them were:Captain America: Come on the Rubber baby helmet look was terrible are you telling me that they couldn't find a better look for him. The costume was terrible. 1. I know it's traditional but come on come up with something new; the light blue was terrible and looked like a child's costume. I mean the darker blue in Captain America the 1st avenger was better than in Avengers. 2. The rubber baby helmet. What the hell!! It looked terrible they could have done something that came up to his ears, and wrapped around his head letting his hair come out the top. Sorta of like Cyclops in Xmen, I'm sorry the full head cover was absolutely terrible. Chris Evans is a good looking Actor Show him off more, not make him look ridiculous. I mean if they can revamp Superman costume and make it look fantastic... They need to go back on the drawing board on Captain Americas Costume.The Hulk: Honestly I couldn't stand looking at him the digital creation they had was horrible. They went from The hulk (2003) which was a bit cartoonish, but OK. To The Incredible Hulk (2008) which I think was fantastic, the CGI was fantastic you could see muscle def, hair moved instead of looked glued down, and looked like a HULK. The hulk they had in the avengers look run down, old, ""Smaller"" I always envisioned hulk as a big massive thing. This hulk was barely towering over anyone. I'm sorry I just didn't agree with the thing they had there at all. But because they have recast the hulk like 20 times, also brings down the appeal how can you really build up your appeal for the character if you keep changing out the actor. That is an ""Epic Fail""!!But other than that I liked the movie, was very good, better than the XMen why because they were actually fighting something bigger than the screen. I hate like XMen where everyone they were fighting was the same, and so small... they needed to throw in an Apocalypse, Onslaught, something was the enemy is a real Enemy.

2020-11-11,"Ah yes, the finale of the first story arc within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As one would expect, a story arc's finale can often determine how you view the arc as a whole, and a bad finale can really leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. Luckily, this movie ISN'T a bad finale, quite the contrary in fact. The plot is well thought out, the pacing is pretty good, but what makes this movie great are the interactions between the characters. Having set up all the important ones in the previous movies, this movie utilizes every character trait of each character as a way of creating both conflicts and collaborations. Every character has their way of dealing with things, and when they all get put in the same room, natually there will be arguments. That's what I like about this movie: it doesn't just put all the characters in a team and call it a day, there is progression required, and the movie knows it. The action is well made, the performances are fantastic, and the story feels grand and important, fitting for such a movie. My only issue with the film is the ""Ending of the world"" trope that gets tiring immediately, and while watching the heroes fight together is awesome, the stakes doesn't feel as big, as it is easy to lose traction of the small dangers when you're getting a bigger one shoved in you face all the time.

The graphics capability is there so don't cheapen it by taking short cuts.It distracts from the entire movie.That, and great effects mixed in with the most primitive of video overdubbing.

2012-04-27,"With the success of Jon Favreau's 'Iron Man' in 2008, calls started ringing out across the comic book universe for not only further comic book movies, but also for the 'The Holy Grail of Cinematic Superheroes,' which is also known as an 'Avengers' film. What followed was four more Marvel Universe movies, the introduction of many favoured and established characters and the continual teasing of fans across the globe with post-credit sequences. The introduction of Samuel L. Jackson as Commander Nick Fury inevitably announced to fans that an 'Avengers' movie would come to fruition and it brought forth the key question of when rather than where, who and why.The man tasked with throwing all these vibrant characters into a smouldering cauldron of excitement and pure unadulterated geekiness is one Joss Whedon. He's already created three incredibly successful television shows and an incredibly successful tie-in movie in 'Serenity,' but this is undoubtedly his biggest challenge to date. Today sees the release of 'The Avengers' (or 'Avengers Assemble' in the United Kingdom) across the globe, and while it contains evident flaws, it's nothing short of a two hour canonical ride across the Marvel Universe which provides everything to satisfy fans, nerds and casual cinema-goers alike.Buried deep beneath a Government facility is the mystical cube known as the tesseract. When it begins to mysteriously start operating by itself Commander Nick Fury, and his agents Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), unexpectedly come face-to-face with the Asgard deity Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The God is being seemingly controlled by a higher being, with but one simple, yet distinct aim, to control, enslave and destroy the Earth and humanity. With reluctance, Fury initiates the 'Avengers' protocol, which brings together the rag-tag team of superheroes consisting of: Iron Man Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), the Asgard God Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Clint 'Hawkeye' Barton (Jeremy Renner), the Black Widow Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and the unpredictable Dr Banner (Mark Ruffalo).Where 'The Avengers' had the ability to fall pretty darn hard was with the amount of material ready at hand. Joss Whedon could've potentially created a ten-hour-three-film epic without even scratching the surface of what drives these beings to do what they do. Instead, in the running time which extends to just over two hours, he's created an intimate and humanised portrayal of six individuals who may be Gods, geniuses, super-human beings and destructive radioactive experiments on the outside, but all reflect deep, inner trauma on the inside.The initial meetings between the characters show an element of distrust and reluctance. Why should one be subordinate to others when, by all accounts in their own minds, they all have the better technology, powers or intellect? With their flaws prominently on show from the beginning Whedon doesn't just show the audience superheroes, but he creates them before your own eyes. Building these characters from the inside, outside he allows the audience to empathise with their plights. After all, Thor is simply an Asgardian God with family issues, Dr Banner simply wants to be left alone in isolation to his own devices, and Black Widow and Hawkeye seem to battling those basic primal urges that come with humanity and prolonged friendship.But one character that does continually feel out of place is the antagonist of the piece, Loki. Despite Tom Hiddleston creating a superb maniacal villain with thespian traits who thrives on power and destruction, it's hard to shake-off the fact that Loki he is constantly being undermined by those pulling his puppeteering strings. Yet, this should not detract away from his performance which constantly steals the show whenever he is on-screen with other members of the Avengers initiative, and which can be partly attributed to Josh Whedon and Zak Penn's slick screenplay.The script contains some suspect writing in places, especially with regards to Dr Banner and some of the more unusually up-beat and intellectually void phrases he spouts. But aside from the odd sentence here or there, Whedon and Penn's script manages to combine the right mix or humour, bravado and arrogance allowing, not only each character's personality to thrive, but also the plot to be continually be driven forward. Whether it's the blossoming relationship between two prominent superheroes or the developing nature of the narrative, the film is never stagnant, and it's this plot development which gives Joss Whedon the ability to let his comic book geekdom roam free in the final act with an enthralling visual action-orientated conclusion.Starting in Manhattan, the action takes place on the ground, in the air, inside buildings and generally anywhere where there's an enough room to photograph a glorious all battle of good versus evil. Explosions saturate the air, but there's also an enjoyable emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, especially when the likes of Hawkeye, Black Widow and Captain America are left without their weapons. Beautifully choreographed, fast, frenetic and aesthetically pleasing the final thirty minutes are a fitting and welcome conclusion to an epic comic book movie. Joss Whedon hasn't only managed to finally bring the six glorious superheroes to the big-screen. But he's also also managed to do it well, very well.",8.0,2012-04,Friday,"action:0.03, after:0.02, all:0.07, already:0.03, also:0.11, america:0.03, amount:0.03, an:0.15, and:0.28, are:0.03, as:0.04, assemble:0.03, at:0.02, audience:0.06, avengers:0.09, away:0.03, banner:0.07, battle:0.03, be:0.08, before:0.02, beginning:0.03, being:0.07, better:0.02, between:0.05, big:0.02, biggest:0.03, black:0.06, book:0.09, bring:0.03, brings:0.03, brought:0.03, but:0.11, by:0.07, can:0.02, captain:0.03, character:0.04, characters:0.06, chris:0.05, cinema:0.03, cinematic:0.03, come:0.07, comic:0.08, could:0.02, development:0.03, do:0.06, does:0.02, doesn:0.03, downey:0.02, each:0.02, earth:0.03, enough:0.02, epic:0.06, especially:0.05, evans:0.02, even:0.02, everything:0.02, evil:0.03, face:0.07, fact:0.03, fans:0.08, feel:0.03, film:0.04, final:0.06, finally:0.03, for:0.02, four:0.03, from:0.06, fury:0.07, god:0.08, good:0.02, had:0.02, hard:0.06, have:0.01, hawkeye:0.06, he:0.14, hemsworth:0.03, here:0.02, hiddleston:0.05, his:0.11, hour:0.07, hours:0.03, humour:0.03, in:0.11, instead:0.03, into:0.02, iron:0.03, is:0.10, it:0.08, itself:0.03, jackson:0.03, jeremy:0.03, johansson:0.02, joss:0.08, jr:0.02, just:0.03, left:0.07, let:0.03, loki:0.05, man:0.05, many:0.02, mark:0.02, marvel:0.03, may:0.03, minutes:0.03, more:0.03, movie:0.03, movies:0.03, never:0.02, nick:0.05, not:0.04, nothing:0.03, of:0.20, off:0.02, on:0.10, one:0.05, only:0.06, or:0.08, other:0.02, others:0.03, out:0.03, over:0.02, own:0.08, performance:0.03, place:0.06, plot:0.04, power:0.03, powers:0.03, pretty:0.03, rather:0.03, renner:0.03, right:0.02, robert:0.02, ruffalo:0.02, samuel:0.03, scarlett:0.02, screen:0.04, script:0.05, seem:0.03, sequences:0.03, short:0.03, should:0.05, show:0.11, simple:0.03, simply:0.06, some:0.03, stark:0.02, start:0.03, super:0.02, superheroes:0.11, takes:0.03, team:0.02, tesseract:0.03, than:0.02, that:0.04, the:0.54, their:0.07, them:0.02, there:0.05, these:0.06, they:0.03, this:0.03, thor:0.03, those:0.05, time:0.02, to:0.26, together:0.02, tom:0.05, tony:0.03, two:0.08, universe:0.09, up:0.02, ve:0.02, very:0.02, villain:0.02, visual:0.03, wants:0.04, was:0.02, well:0.03, what:0.05, whedon:0.13, when:0.07, where:0.07, which:0.13, while:0.03, who:0.05, why:0.05, widow:0.06, with:0.17, without:0.05, would:0.02, writing:0.03, yet:0.06, your:0.02"
2013-01-07,"The Avengers is one of these rare movies where it lives up to all the tons of hype it has gotten! It has made over 1.5 billion dollars, and it has received high praise from both fans and critics. And the success of this movie is very well deserved! The really great thing about this movie doesn't come from all the action, humor or visual effects... It is to see all these characters interact with each other in one room! Joss Whedon truly was the man for the job, and he impresses once again with his ability to portray each character as meaningful as the other. Everybody counts! There isn't one hero, but six of them! And they are all relevant and meaningful, plus all their character development is superb... All of them! Whedon has my full respect! The visual effects in this movie are out of this world! It really is spectacular and a joy to watch! The cinematography is likewise beautiful in this movie! But in the technical department all my praise and full respect goes to Alan Silvestri! His score for this movie blew me away! Especially, the ""Avengers Assemble"" tune! No gripes from me in the technical department!As for the cast they are all terrific! Robert Downey Jr. is easily my favorite and probably the funniest in this movie! Mark Ruffalo makes the best Bruce Banner aka ""The Hulk"" to date, with a serious and human, yet comedic performance! Chris Evans is still quite good as Captain America. As far as performances go, this guy is probably the weakest. But he's still an awesome actor! Chris Hemsworth isn't a remarkable actor either, but he has nice charisma and fits the role as Thor! Scarlett Johansson is smoking hot and sexy, and much more relevant than she was in Iron Man 2! Jeremy Renner was just pure badass Agent Clint Barton aka Hawkeye! Samuel L. Jackson was epic and badass in the role of Nick Fury! Tom Hiddleston isn't exactly a really strong or serious villain. Mostly he just feels like a comic relief. But Hiddleston can act, and he's got a few agonizing scenes!

2012-06-16,"The Avengers is almost the definition of good time at the movies. Not burdened with the need to spend great amounts of time on character origins, this superhero film takes a conveniently short amount of time to put the game in play, and once it does that, the game is played with flair and showmanship.Quite frankly, the plot itself is absurd, but I guess that was bound to happen when you combine the worlds of five different Marvel heroes. In less capable hands, the Avengers may well have ended up getting muddled from trying to do too much. With Joss Whedon in the director's chair, it's actually a very strait forward two hours with a good level of focus.While New York ends up getting the same treatment as much of Michael Bay's resume, the experience is far less superficial. the Avengers does not insult our intelligence. quite the opposite in fact, it embraces it. The Avengers' best quality is that it never ceases to wink at itself. This is a movie where even the villains the same quick fire one liners as the heroes. A good protagonist of course is also the difference between good action movie and good movie. Simply put, these people (or rather super people) are just good fun to be around. While none of them are ever quite fully rounded, when they come together as a team, they seem far less superficial than they did in their individual movies. with the exception of Iron Man, the films of Thor, Captain America, and The Incredible Hulk, were not all that memorable when it came to characters. The Avengers makes you realize how distinctive each character is.One thing I was a little disappointed in was Samuel L. Jackson. While he is very much at home in the role he plays, it seems pretty obvious that he's just playing himself. Perhaps, there is a hidden positive in this. As a supporting character, you don't wanna upstage the people who have top billings. Personally, I think he could've given The Avengers a little bit more love.Last summer was a somewhat underwhelming year for superheros. It's a pleasure then to see a film like The Avengers fly in to save the day.

The script works well despite the plot being very big budget Hollywood, and it has some nice funny touches here and there. The final battle in New York (where was Spider-man when all this was going on?) is very well developed that sticks to the equal share of each character very well and gives a good portion of what the audience want to see (action mayhem).

2012-05-14,"I loved Iron Man and Thor, enjoyed Captain America: The First Avenger, and was slightly disappointed in Iron Man 2. But even the best of those movies were just a lead-up to The Avengers, which is absolutely one of the finest superhero movies, and one of the most entertaining movies of any kind, that I've seen.This is pure summer blockbuster fun. And I don't mean that in a way that limits the movie, but instead as an example of the best of what a summer blockbuster can be. The story is rather straightforward: a massive threat to Earth that's too big for any of our heroes to handle alone, and a rocky road of butting egos and misunderstandings stands between them and working together as a team. It's clear, easy to follow, and only has the briefest moments of lost momentum. The Avengers feels like it's the perfect length, with no action scenes that drag on too long into mindlessness or uneven pacing.What struck me most about it was the humor. It carried the movie even more than the excellent action scenes, the well-handled exposition or the interplay between our heroes. The Avengers is outright hilarious at times. The laughs are woven organically throughout. The tone of the movie just feels right, which is probably the best compliment that I can give it.I must say that my expectations were easily surpassed by the first assembly of the Earth's mightiest heroes. Marvel definitely made the right decision to carefully lay the groundwork for The Avengers the past few years, and it paid off. And it helps immensely that they chose the right man to write and direct it.

Jackson)-who are called upon to battle evil Asgardian Loki (Tom Hiddleston) when he threatens to invade the planet with his Chitauri army.The Avengers made an absolute mint at the box-office, proving to me that a large percentage of cinema-goers aren't all that fussed about an innovative or intelligible script just so long as they get plenty of bang for their buck. Written and directed by Joss Whedon, The Avengers Assemble (as it is known in the UK) is an unnecessarily convoluted superhero blockbuster wrapped around the most tired of premises: an evil being seeking a mystical energy source that will give him the power to rule the world.

2012-06-14,"If you haven't seen The Avengers yet, you must be completely immune to hype. Give yourself a pat on the shoulder.But to be fair, it is entertaining and worth the watch, especially if you're interested in witnessing a curious film trend I've been noticing lately that's pretty much formula for The Avengers. The trend is this: the beginning is smart, suspenseful, and witty, with a somewhat interesting story. For the end, you can just turn your brain right off. And people love it.We start out with characters who have interesting back stories to divulge, some weighty threats and the hilarious jokes you knew would be there the second you found out this would be directed and written by Joss Whedon. Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.) absolutely rapid-fires the hilarity, as expected, and Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a comedic accomplice. Who quickly vanishes from the story. The Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) hints at some dark secrets and it's not clear whether Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is a help or a big looming threat of letting loose and tearing everyone to pieces. Actually, if you've ever seen a movie before, it is pretty clear. Captain America (Chris Evans) had some potential because he's from WWII era, but was used mostly for jokes at the expense of his anachronisms; he was frozen for half of the past century so he doesn't really get modern cultural references, technology, etc. I can't stand Thor and I cannot believe what a joke his solo film looked like from the trailer, nor that Natalie Portman would get herself mixed up in that mess, but maybe that's just me. But the other Avengers are interesting and well- written. For the first half of the movie.What bothered many critics wasn't even a concern to me. In a search for something to be nit-picky about, lots of critics have complained that there was too much in-fighting between the heroes, who were clearly being manipulated to turn against one another by evil-mastermind Loki. However, this didn't take up much screen-time and was done in a well-written and believable way. I thought what they were bickering about was kind of reasonable. I would be a little upset too if my boss lied to me about developing nuclear weapons of mass destruction.I was led to believe that half of the movie would be the Avengers fighting each other (and when you say fighting with relation to Super Heroes, you think actual, physical fighting). Nope, it was just one scene of some very reasonable banter.Okay there is one fight scene between Thor and Iron Man that went on a little while, and I personally can't even keep my eyes open during action scenes with no dialogue, but I felt like it was justified and when you think about it, people want to see Thor go up against Iron Man. Again, not incredibly problematic.They were right about the enemy not having a very good, strong, reasonable or deep motivation for taking over Earth. This is another reason why I think we were given leave to turn our brains off after half of the movie. At the beginning, it looks like Loki might be a worthy and complex opponent. He has some qualms with the American belief in freedom. Kinda seemed like he was going somewhere with that. But he didn't, which makes it seem like a gimmicky attempt to make this bad guy stand out from Sauron or Darth Vader, which, while one-dimensional, were good villains because they stood for something metaphorical i.e. the dark side of humanity or the Germans in WWII. Loki's just evil for the sake of being evil. But you've already heard that.The real problem in this movie is that after all that time spent writing up interesting characters and weighty plot points that delve into issues like a possible limitless energy source and the dangers of nuclear war, actually managing to cover new territory on that front, and making a formidable enemy that should require something brilliantly clever to defeat, we get a really long extended fight scene, fixes that aren't believable and border on plot holes, a complete undermining of the big bad guy's abilities, not to mention some predictability. Oh boy, where do I start?The screenplay must have ended after The Avengers got to Manhattan. I'm gonna guess 2/3 into the screen time. From there on out, it's mostly one-liners. Yawn. I liked the flying things that made me cringe when they flew into the beautiful New York architecture that is now, in that fictional world, gone forever.

2015-01-12,"I'm not really a comic book fan, so after hearing the constant hype about this film for a couple of years I really wasn't too fussed when it finally appeared on TV. I went into it expecting not to like it much, and indeed the first hour seemed to me middling at best: some mildly lame comedy, a whole lot of posturing, and a silly storyline involving silly characters.Then things changed. They started to pick up, and the action started hitting home. Then all hell broke loose with a climax that felt like it lasted a whole hour, an hour packed with kaiju-style mayhem as New York found itself subjected to an alien invasion. And I was wowed. Never before has it been possible to depict such constant, wide-scale mayhem, but with the improvement of CGI technology it's finally up there on screen with all of its glory.And yes, I ended up liking MARVEL'S AVENGERS ASSEMBLE. What's not to like, really? The whole feel is kept light and there are so many larger-than-life characters that you end up having a ball with it regardless. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is my favourite character by far - Ruffalo is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana or Edward Norton - but Chris Evans's Captain America comes a close second. Sure, I see this film for what it is: a mindless piece of crowd-pleasing, overblown CGI mayhem, replete with a silly, buffoonish bad guy - but at the same time I can't help but getting caught up for the ride.",8.0,2015-01,Monday,"about:0.05, action:0.04, after:0.06, alien:0.08, all:0.07, america:0.05, an:0.09, and:0.15, are:0.04, as:0.04, assemble:0.09, at:0.09, avengers:0.04, bad:0.07, been:0.05, before:0.07, best:0.05, better:0.06, book:0.07, but:0.13, by:0.05, can:0.05, captain:0.05, cgi:0.15, character:0.05, characters:0.09, chris:0.07, comedy:0.09, comes:0.08, comic:0.06, end:0.07, evans:0.07, fan:0.07, far:0.15, feel:0.07, felt:0.08, film:0.08, finally:0.16, first:0.05, for:0.10, found:0.09, getting:0.09, guy:0.08, has:0.05, having:0.08, help:0.10, hour:0.28, hulk:0.04, hype:0.09, into:0.06, is:0.11, it:0.22, its:0.06, itself:0.09, life:0.08, like:0.13, lot:0.06, many:0.06, mark:0.06, marvel:0.05, me:0.05, much:0.05, my:0.05, never:0.06, new:0.07, norton:0.09, not:0.11, of:0.13, on:0.08, or:0.05, packed:0.08, really:0.15, role:0.08, ruffalo:0.12, same:0.07, screen:0.06, second:0.08, see:0.05, seemed:0.10, so:0.08, some:0.05, storyline:0.09, such:0.07, sure:0.08, than:0.10, that:0.06, the:0.20, then:0.13, there:0.09, they:0.04, things:0.08, this:0.06, time:0.05, to:0.19, too:0.06, up:0.24, was:0.03, wasn:0.08, went:0.09, what:0.09, when:0.05, whole:0.22, with:0.20, years:0.07, yes:0.09, york:0.09, you:0.04"
2012-06-29,"The first time I saw this movie I thought it was a well crafted superhero movie. But when seeing it the second time you start to pick up on somethings and it just isn't that good. Now I am not downing this movie since it's not as entertaining as the first time seeing it. But you just notice some weaknesses. Now when it comes to the plot there really isn't anything all that original. A certain team needs to get their act together and not quarrel, bicker and fight amongst each other. In order to fight and win against a battle or a game when the odds are against them. Seem familiar? Because it has been done countless times. But the execution is the most important thing and the execution for the movie is well done and entertaining most of the way through. The final fight at the end is worth the price of admission. However when it comes to the plot there really isn't anything special that makes it stand out. The plot and editing in ""John Carter"" in my opinion is more well done than this in my opinion. But unfortunately ""John Carter"" didn't do so well at all when compared to this movie. Now Josh Whedon did a pretty good job when it comes to the Marvel characters portrayed in this movie and stuck pretty close to the comic book materials. But in the comics although the characters are arrogant there are other elements that turns it away from it being the main focus. For this movie arrogance is the main part of what the characters face and is one of the biggest obstacle in their path. What ""The Avengers"" do is constantly have a penis measuring competition with each other when the world is at stake. Anyways the fighting and action sequences are really entertaining and cool to watch. Some scenes are like superhero smackdown battles so those scenes were entertaining as well, despite it all happening over arrogance and pride.

2012-06-11,"Avengers Assemble is the best superhero film ever made. I thought it was better than The Dark Knight and as soon as it started, I felt like seeing Harry Potter all over again at the cinema. It mainly follows up from 'Captain America: The First Avenger', 'Thor' and 'Iron Man 2', S.H.I.E.L.D boss Nick Fury brings together a group of human superheroes who have different identities and events in their pasts: Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr), Hulk (Edward Norton is out. Mark Ruffalo is in), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) with S.H.I.E.L.D assassins: Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Bourne Legacy's Jeremy Renner) to stop a villain from destroying earth forever. The massive battle scene is incredible. Strangely enough besides that there's a bit more laughter in this than any other SH film. I don't know how the sequel's going to turn out to be. After you've seen this you'll be asking the same question as me: how will it make it bigger and better?

2012-08-28,I can't really say anything that anyone else hasn't said about this film. Go out and watch it and you'll love it. Best film of the year so far. That's all I really have to say about this movie. Basic Details to mention would be that the CGI is pretty good but can still stick out a bit easily.

2012-05-26,"Joss Whedon was a great choice for a director, and he always does a good job at finding the right guy to play the villain, Loki. Great collaboration from the actors with fairly equal spotlight given to the characters. By far the best Hulk ever! I've never been a fan of the Hulk until I saw this movie. The only thing I thought was a tad bit cheesy were the space aliens at the end. Some movies have computer generated characters without it looking computer generated, but these definitely looked like they belonged in an xbox360 video game. I'm looking forward to seeing the sequel to this movie. I liked the other characters who were included in this movie as well, even though marvel didn't make any previous movies to introduce them.

2013-12-12,"It seems like besides Nolan's Batman and The Punisher, I am doomed to never appreciate the dull action/super hero films that seem to sweep the film world and produce millions of misguided teen action junkies. This would be a gem for cinema experience of huge 200 inch TV's but there is a reason these films never gain academy awards genuine ground breaking respect aside from budget and ratings. The point of this review is just an opinionated rant to quarrel with the repetitive plots and average performances that people seem to just eat up and refuse to expand fantastic cinema experience because they're long and to them 'boring' I can state what's boring, A hero is at the height of their average power, suddenly they encounter an ability or change that makes them more powerful and nearly worshiped (Iron Man, Thor, Cpt America, Batman, Spiderman) Now a girl or love interest that comes along and makes them vulnerable or around the time where they become vulnerable because typically, these films have to take their powers away. (Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk, Batman, Spiderman, Wolverine and Superman) Now they are usually hated at this point because they can't protect the masses or their loved ones or are just in doubt if they should pick up their dusty war torn mantle. (Iron Man, Batman, Hulk and Wolverine) And the bad guy is defeated, the girl is usually saved except poor old batman. (Wolverine, Iron Man, Spiderman, The Hulk.) DO you see where I am leading too? Do people like watching the same stuff just wearing a different cape? (metaphore for the smarties out there)I am a fan of Kurbick, Tarentino, Del Toro (whoops I am a Hellboy fan), Scorsese, Finch, Mendes, Aronofsky, Eastwood and Anderson fan among others, and I know the guidelines between a film for fun and a film for what is described as 'moving art' or groundbreaking visual emotion and plot.

2012-08-19,"Will star this short review by saying I hate superheroes movies, I hated Captain America movie, I dislike Thor movie, which was, for me, average, so you can pretty much imagine my negative vibe about seeing this one, but after SO much good reviews and super-high score I said, what the hell, if I did saw Iron Man and was mildly interesting this one should be too.How could I be so wrong about this, the director Joss Whedon show me what prejudice towards a movie is and sure I am that I felt slap in the face like Hult teaching me how to tennis..The movie is AWESOME, there is no other point or way to express it, every character in this movie excels, from Thor to Captain America to the assassins and Stark, each and everyone excels with very good narrative, incredible action scenes involving each and everyone of them and glorious scenes one after the other.Even humor works incredible well through the whole movie, there is no denying this, the director, the staff, the actors they show a deep connection to this project, they all have great chemistry and this shows in a movie that is BRILLIANT each step of the way.Stark/Iron Man is one the the most shown on screen and I totally loved it, they all have their proper time on screen, in fact, I can hardly understand how a movie of this magnitude with SO much going on and so much things that could failed didn't.It's no wonder Hollywood is thrilled by it's success. I really hope this new gem of a movie is not used to try and imitate the formula without the magic this one has because, make no mistake, behind all this special effects, shiny images, action scenes and interactions what stand about the most on this movie is the chemistry between all the heroes, even the villain, there is no denying.From a guy who hate superheroes movies I give this movie a perfect 10, this is no joke this movie is THE BEST blockbuster of this year, totally recommended, even for the wife who hates explosions and the kids will love it!PD: please watch the whole ending, even after the credits, that last 2 minutes are PRICELES!",9.0,2012-08,Sunday,"10:0.04, about:0.10, action:0.05, actors:0.05, after:0.12, all:0.09, am:0.05, america:0.06, and:0.22, are:0.03, awesome:0.05, be:0.05, because:0.04, best:0.03, between:0.05, blockbuster:0.06, brilliant:0.06, but:0.02, by:0.06, can:0.06, captain:0.06, character:0.03, could:0.08, credits:0.06, did:0.04, didn:0.05, director:0.09, each:0.11, effects:0.04, even:0.14, every:0.04, everyone:0.09, face:0.06, fact:0.06, felt:0.05, for:0.04, from:0.06, give:0.05, going:0.04, good:0.06, great:0.03, guy:0.05, has:0.03, have:0.05, heroes:0.04, high:0.05, hollywood:0.06, hope:0.06, how:0.11, humor:0.05, if:0.03, in:0.08, incredible:0.10, interesting:0.06, iron:0.06, is:0.22, it:0.09, joss:0.04, last:0.05, like:0.03, love:0.05, loved:0.06, make:0.04, man:0.06, me:0.10, minutes:0.06, most:0.07, movie:0.24, movies:0.06, much:0.14, my:0.03, new:0.05, no:0.21, not:0.02, of:0.09, on:0.10, one:0.12, or:0.03, other:0.07, perfect:0.05, point:0.05, pretty:0.05, really:0.03, review:0.06, reviews:0.06, said:0.06, saw:0.05, scenes:0.12, screen:0.08, seeing:0.05, short:0.06, should:0.05, show:0.11, so:0.14, special:0.04, stand:0.06, star:0.06, stark:0.09, super:0.04, superheroes:0.08, sure:0.05, that:0.08, the:0.39, their:0.03, them:0.03, there:0.09, they:0.08, things:0.05, this:0.31, thor:0.06, through:0.05, time:0.03, to:0.11, too:0.04, understand:0.06, used:0.06, very:0.03, villain:0.05, was:0.05, watch:0.03, way:0.08, well:0.03, what:0.09, whedon:0.04, which:0.04, who:0.07, whole:0.10, will:0.07, with:0.04, without:0.05, wrong:0.06, year:0.05, you:0.03"

2012-06-25,"Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Captain America (Chris Evans) make The Avengers. This film is pretty sweet. The Avengers assemble to face off against the god of mischief himself, Loki (portrayed by Tom Hiddleston). What does The Avengers have? Awesome visual effects; great characters; great direction; not the best plot. I can't think of any other villains that they could have fought against, well villains of these superheroes. Magneto or a Batman villain could have worked, but of course that goes out of their section of villains. I just wasn't feeling the alien invasion thing. Though, the action was incredible – and it prevented the viewer from becoming bored. The gags were really funny, Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk added charisma to the film. The film casts a big box office shadow for upcoming super hero films like The Amazing Spider-Man and The Dark Knight Rises, so hopefully those don't disappoint.My expectations were high, from hearing all of the awesome things about it, so I didn't enjoy it AS much as I wanted to. Granted, the film is still better than one's average super hero film and was still enjoyable.

2013-01-19,"I know a lot of critics and fans loved this movie, but unfortunately, this movie just didn't do anything for me. My first biggest problem with this movie: Mark Ruffalo was HORRIBLE as Bruce Banner! It was like he was sleepwalking through the entire movie! Marvel fired Edward Norton, and the best replacement they could find was this guy? Did they just pick his name out of a hat? Come on! My second biggest problem with this movie: Captain America gets pushed to the side, and most of the focus is on Iron Man. Why?! Here's a crazy idea: Seeing as how Captain America is the LEADER of the Avengers! Why not give him the spotlight? Furthermore, Iron Man and Captain America hardly ever get along in this movie. This wasn't at ALL like it was in the comics! In the comics, Tony Stark deeply admired and respected Steve Rogers. In Fact, Tony Stark's father, Howard helped create the ""Captain America"" program. My third biggest problem with this movie: It takes FOREVER for the The Avengers to come together and work as a team. Throughout the movie, all they do is fight most of the time, and occasionally throw in a corny joke. Can someone please tell me what purpose that serves, other than to look cool? If you like generic, run of the mill, superhero movies, then give this a watch.

2012-07-26,"In a nutshell, the Avengers are six superheroes brought together by an organisation called SHIELD to protect the Earth. The Avengers (a product of the Marvel comic book publishing company) are Black Widow, The Hulk, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye and Iron Man. Four of these have already had movies made about them (as part of the same franchise) and this movie draws heavily on that. Out of the four earlier movies involving these superheroes, I enjoyed Thor and The Hulk. I was not particularly bowled over by the Iron Man and Captain America movies. I have to admit a bias: as a childhood DC fan, I was never able to get into Marvel comics. Also, I'm not into video games at all.As you might expect, this movie was a parade of spectacular effects, superhero stunts, fearsome aliens, wild technology, city obliterating fights, shootouts, chases and so on. When I say spectacular special effects, I am not kidding. It's astonishing what filmmakers are able to show on screen nowadays.There was also a good deal of superhero clichés (of the good kind), jingoism (both noble and sappy), comedy, snappy one-liners, oiled biceps and tight leotards. Speaking of the latter two, Chris Hemsworth makes a great Thor.Chris Evans...well, let's just say I don't quite get Captain America as much as I get Chris Evans. I prefer him as the wise-cracking Torch. Mark Ruffalo was OK as Bruce Banner, but the script didn't really give him a chance to do his stuff. This movie was mostly about Iron Man, but I'm not into this superhero. I really don't get Iron Man. Such a waste of a good actor.In general, this movie seemed a little forced to me. There were parts of it that I was unable or unwilling to follow closely. The film had a very fast pace, perhaps too much action. It was clearly designed to be primarily an adrenalin-inducing visual experience. The problem is that I don't go to movies to get an adrenalin rush. I go to be entertained, an emotional and intellectual process, not a physical one.I also have to confess that this movie seems quite similar to other action films I've seen lately. It's getting hard to tell them apart. Scary aliens, awesome technology, skyscraper carnage, endangered Earth. This genre seems to have the same four themes popping up over and over again. I suppose I've become jaded, but maybe it's time for something different? Now that we can show virtually anything on film, it's time to move to other things, don't you think? I yearn for the near-religious awe and excitement I felt when I saw Close Encounter of the Third Kind for the first time many years ago. Avengers is the kind of movie that doesn't deliver that to me. This movie evoked no emotion in me at all really. I didn't feel anything for the characters in this film. I didn't really care what happened to any of them. I felt mostly annoyance at the NYC destruction scenes. The highlight of the film for me involved the amusing final scene with Hulk and Loki, but that's all I'm going to say.It's an entertaining film. No different than the others really. You might as well see it. Everyone else has.

2012-05-03,"Pumped, excited, mighty, happy and satisfied. These are just some of the feelings I got right after watching this incredible movie. Driving home from the cinema, talking about it, commenting are favorite parts while storm is brewing over us. It was like Thor himself was watching, proud of work that he and his superhero friends have done. This is much more than a summer blockbuster, much more than a popcorn flick. This movie has a point. It is the culmination of everything that happened from Iron Man through Captain America. It starts with a bang, it ends with it. It's action packed, funny, and will keep your eyes glued to the screen for 143 minutes. Special effects are top-notch, beautiful, simply incredible and if you choose to watch the movie in IMAX 3D you're going to shake in your seat. But effects are just that, this movie features an amazing cast. They fit together so nicely, everyone got just enough of screen time, everyone's motives explained. Many will again say this is not that much of an art, it's just a lot of explosions and fights between superheroes. But it is so much more, you just have to see it to believe it.

I have seen this movie multiple times and it has me on the edge of my seat every time.

This is for good reason, since the majority of Comic Book Movies (CBM's) created so far are still bad to awful. But ever since Brian Singer's X-Men in 2000, they've been mostly getting better. X-Men was revolutionary because it was very good, camp was minimized, and it was the first watchable film to feature a super team. 'Avengers' is revolutionary for the 1st two reasons, and because it weaves together 3 previously existing movie franchises plus supporting characters into a unified, cohesive whole. Imagine if someone tried to blend The Terminator with James Bond. A lot of us nerds were worried that this movie would be a big, crowded, confusing, silly bit of idiotic posing and exploding emptiness. But fortunately, it is not so. The script is true to the respective characters and is great fun. Especially to anybody who grew up reading Marvel comics. We called ourselves Marvelites back in the day, and when we were 12-years-old reading Marvel comics, we felt that the Marvel Universe was somehow real in a sense we couldn't articulate, and deep down we all wanted to be heroes living in a world of other heroes. This movie gets you as close to that as you can, at least within a theater. We comic nerds like our heroes, and we want our heroes to have interesting and distinct personalities. We like them to have weaknesses and emotions, but we like them to suck it up and be heroes when the chips are down. And at the same time, we don't want them to cross the line into corn or camp. Well, I guess you can't avoid a little corn, but thankfully there is no camp. This isn't Citizen Kane, mind you, but then, Citizen Kane didn't have the Hulk. So there you go. Based on what my non-nerd friends say, this film is good fun for non-nerds too.",10.0,2012-05,Friday,"about:0.04, all:0.03, and:0.22, are:0.06, as:0.06, at:0.07, avengers:0.03, back:0.06, bad:0.05, be:0.09, because:0.09, been:0.04, better:0.05, big:0.05, bit:0.06, book:0.10, but:0.13, can:0.07, characters:0.07, comic:0.13, comics:0.12, couldn:0.07, day:0.07, didn:0.05, don:0.04, down:0.12, especially:0.06, ever:0.05, far:0.06, felt:0.06, film:0.10, first:0.04, for:0.07, fun:0.10, gets:0.06, getting:0.07, go:0.05, good:0.10, great:0.04, have:0.09, heroes:0.22, hulk:0.03, if:0.04, in:0.09, interesting:0.07, into:0.09, is:0.15, isn:0.06, it:0.11, least:0.06, like:0.13, line:0.07, little:0.05, lot:0.10, marvel:0.11, mind:0.07, movie:0.07, movies:0.03, my:0.04, no:0.04, not:0.03, of:0.10, old:0.07, on:0.03, or:0.04, other:0.08, our:0.14, real:0.06, reason:0.07, same:0.06, say:0.05, script:0.06, sense:0.07, since:0.12, so:0.10, still:0.05, super:0.05, team:0.05, that:0.07, the:0.25, theater:0.07, them:0.12, then:0.05, there:0.07, they:0.07, this:0.11, time:0.04, to:0.23, together:0.04, too:0.05, true:0.07, two:0.06, universe:0.06, up:0.07, us:0.06, ve:0.05, very:0.04, want:0.11, was:0.13, we:0.45, well:0.04, were:0.08, what:0.04, when:0.08, who:0.04, whole:0.06, with:0.03, world:0.05, would:0.04, years:0.05, you:0.15"

This is how transformers saga should have been, all that beautiful CGI, eye candy pleaser, mixed with some genuine well written script, wonderful acting and a very well character development. Thou some characters shine a little more than others, everyone are given their share of screen time, it doesn't feel rushed, it doesn't feel forced, all scenes feel natural, and very well deserved to be in.You get to know the history about some characters like black widow, and hawkeye , and it remove all doubts about them being implemented in the team, everyone needs everybody in order to succeed. As i said before, avengers is transformers, without the sucky part, no one can say its another cgi fest, cause its an excellent movie.As to my favorite superheroe movie, i have to say dark knight still is, cause the story was a little better, but avengers is following closely as second spot surelly.

2012-06-11,"In terms of quality, I would compare ""The Avengers"" to ""Superman"" starring Christopher Reeve, i.e. Absolutely no hokeyness whatsoever. The story was superb, the writing crackled with energy, and the acting was excellent. I thought that that the pacing was magnificent - suspense actually increased as the story proceeded and the perils became more and dire and catastrophic.Each actor and actress seemed to me to be utilized to the optimum not only in terms of their skills as characters, but, moreover, in terms of their thespian skills. I thought that the movie was a real tour-de-force, a sort of how-to-really-do it, beckoning sequels of similar high quality to follow, I hope.I was relieved and glad to see Josh Whedon make full use of Liam Hemsworth as Thor, something I thought was sadly lacking in Hemsworth's first venture in portraying the Viking god. Mark Ruffalo finally gave us the first truly satisfying Hulk since Lou Ferrigno! Even Scarlett Johannson's Black Widow, with ample opportunities to overact, to ham it up, utilized her minimalist skills to allow the audience to interface with the story. In the final set pieces of the movie, Downey and others also played down what was roiling inside of the characters' minds and hearts and souls -allowing the audience, once again, to interact and participate - as opposed to being dictated to or oversold on the emotions. For a fantasy and a superhero movie, that is quite a feat. Not only does Josh Whedon deserve tremendous credit for that result, but also Jon Favreau and Stan Lee - among others - The portrayal of Loki was on a par with Shakespeare's Iago, a character who takes great glee in being purely evil.",9.0,2012-06,Monday,"absolutely:0.09, acting:0.06, actor:0.08, actually:0.07, again:0.06, also:0.10, and:0.28, as:0.13, audience:0.15, avengers:0.03, be:0.04, being:0.12, black:0.05, but:0.06, character:0.05, characters:0.08, do:0.05, does:0.06, down:0.07, downey:0.05, each:0.05, even:0.05, evil:0.08, excellent:0.08, final:0.08, finally:0.07, first:0.10, for:0.06, full:0.08, god:0.07, great:0.04, hemsworth:0.13, her:0.08, high:0.07, hope:0.08, how:0.05, hulk:0.04, in:0.19, is:0.03, it:0.05, loki:0.05, make:0.05, mark:0.05, me:0.05, more:0.04, movie:0.08, no:0.05, not:0.07, of:0.21, on:0.07, once:0.07, only:0.10, or:0.04, others:0.15, played:0.08, quite:0.07, real:0.07, really:0.04, ruffalo:0.05, scarlett:0.06, see:0.04, seemed:0.09, set:0.08, since:0.07, something:0.06, story:0.14, superhero:0.05, takes:0.08, that:0.14, the:0.43, their:0.09, thor:0.04, thought:0.20, to:0.34, truly:0.08, up:0.04, us:0.07, was:0.25, what:0.04, whedon:0.10, who:0.05, widow:0.05, with:0.12, would:0.05, writing:0.09"

The story is OK but some lines are quite corny in their attempt to be funny.It was rather disturbing to see New York City in chaos due to alien invasions as it brings back recent memories of 9-11.

2014-08-01,"A lot of comic-book fans including myself have wondered how can having six larger than life superheroes in one film possibly work? Will they be distributed with the right amount of screen time? Can there be a cohesive story to tell? Will there be plenty of action and visuals? The list of questions goes on and on.Fortunately I can tell you that the hardcore fanboys can put their pitchforks down as writer and director Joss Whedon pulls off a magnificent achievement by bringing the right amount of stability in this superhero circus, engineered to please the fanboys and nonfans alike.The film has a simple storyline, but it's very well-paced filled with adrenaline and streams very nicely. However, it's not the story that makes the film so great, but rather the characters instead. The script written by Joss Whedon never forgets its heroes' humanity as the film explores each characters with a lot of depth with reasons for doing why they're doing what they're doing. The story reconnects us with each character but also finds the time to flesh out each characters strengths and weaknesses, with some wonderful moments of insecurity throughout.Loki, the film's villain is brilliantly portrayed by Tom Hiddleston as a cunning, mischievous, and evil mastermind. Chris Evans solidifies his role as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth portrays a more noble, less arrogant Thor. Mark Ruffalo one of the characters I was worried about during the hype train of this film, went beyond my expectations. He delivers a new kind of Bruce Banner and I would argue the Hulk steals this film. There's also a lovely banter between Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye and Scarlet Johansson's Black Widow, Whedon treats them with respect and they do earn their place in the team. As for Robert Downey Jr., well do I really need to tell you he's awesome as always? Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is finally able to stretch his legs than being just the guy making surprise appearances as he is able to slide into the role quite effortlessly. Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson returns and provides sharp dialog in the film. Cobie Smulders also makes her Marvel film debut as Agent Maria Hill who is Nick Fury's second in command. The visuals are great, as expected, the overall look of the Hulk is very impressive. I loved how ILM modeled it to look like a mixture of Mark Ruffalo, and Jack Kirby's interpretation in the comics.We get a lot of action beats, and a good amount of time is spent on having the heroes talk trash and square off against each other to prove who's the toughest. There's Iron Man vs. Thor, Hawkeye vs. Black Widow, Thor vs. Hulk, and so on. These showdowns allow each character to have their time in the spotlight, and they do build genuine tension. The last 20- 30 minutes of this film is worth the ticket itself. Whedon provides plenty of jaw-dropping action sequences. Though this is a comic-book film, there is a great sense of subtlety and the film explores that. Let's be honest, in many different ways, this movie should not have worked at all. There are too many larger than life characters to juggle and quite frankly it's ridiculous. Joss Whedon's brilliant script has a strong and unique theme of family dynamics. Ultimately these people don't belong together and the whole movie is about finding themselves from community. While doing so they not only realize that they belong together but they need each other. Obviously this is expressed through punching, but that essence is the heart of the film.As a comic-book fan I went into The Avengers with unfairly high expectations, due to all the people who were involved in the project as well as the films that came before. Give massive credit to Joss Whedon and Kevin Feige. The Avengers is a visual spectacle, but it's also a film with brains and heart. At a running-time of two and a half hours, the film is well paced and time flies by. So in every regard, the movie fulfills its hype and raises the bar even higher for Marvel and other superhero films to come and my childhood is avenged.10/10",10.0,2014-08,Friday,"10:0.05, able:0.08, about:0.04, action:0.05, against:0.04, agent:0.08, all:0.03, also:0.09, always:0.03, america:0.02, amount:0.12, and:0.29, are:0.03, as:0.18, at:0.04, avengers:0.03, awesome:0.03, banner:0.03, be:0.07, before:0.03, being:0.03, between:0.03, black:0.05, book:0.08, brilliant:0.04, bruce:0.03, but:0.08, by:0.08, came:0.04, can:0.08, captain:0.02, character:0.04, characters:0.09, chris:0.06, come:0.03, comic:0.07, comics:0.03, depth:0.04, different:0.03, director:0.03, do:0.07, don:0.02, down:0.03, downey:0.02, each:0.14, evans:0.03, even:0.02, every:0.03, evil:0.04, expectations:0.07, expected:0.04, fan:0.03, fans:0.03, film:0.26, films:0.05, finally:0.03, for:0.04, from:0.02, fury:0.06, get:0.02, give:0.03, goes:0.04, good:0.02, great:0.06, guy:0.03, half:0.04, has:0.04, have:0.05, having:0.07, hawkeye:0.05, he:0.06, hemsworth:0.03, her:0.04, heroes:0.05, hiddleston:0.03, high:0.03, his:0.04, hours:0.04, how:0.05, however:0.03, hulk:0.05, hype:0.07, impressive:0.04, in:0.12, instead:0.04, into:0.05, iron:0.02, is:0.17, it:0.06, its:0.05, itself:0.04, jackson:0.03, jeremy:0.03, johansson:0.03, joss:0.09, jr:0.03, just:0.02, kind:0.04, last:0.03, less:0.04, let:0.04, life:0.07, like:0.02, loki:0.02, look:0.07, lot:0.08, loved:0.04, makes:0.06, making:0.03, man:0.02, many:0.05, mark:0.05, marvel:0.04, minutes:0.04, moments:0.03, more:0.02, movie:0.04, my:0.04, need:0.07, never:0.03, new:0.03, nick:0.06, not:0.05, of:0.22, off:0.06, on:0.07, one:0.03, only:0.02, other:0.06, out:0.02, overall:0.03, people:0.05, place:0.04, put:0.03, quite:0.07, rather:0.04, re:0.07, really:0.02, renner:0.03, right:0.06, robert:0.02, role:0.07, ruffalo:0.05, samuel:0.03, screen:0.03, script:0.07, second:0.03, sense:0.04, sequences:0.03, should:0.03, simple:0.04, so:0.07, some:0.02, story:0.06, storyline:0.04, superhero:0.04, superheroes:0.03, team:0.03, than:0.07, that:0.08, the:0.44, their:0.06, them:0.02, there:0.11, these:0.05, they:0.14, this:0.08, thor:0.06, though:0.03, through:0.03, throughout:0.04, time:0.11, to:0.15, together:0.04, tom:0.03, too:0.02, two:0.03, us:0.03, very:0.07, villain:0.03, visual:0.04, was:0.01, we:0.02, well:0.08, went:0.08, were:0.02, what:0.02, whedon:0.14, while:0.03, who:0.06, whole:0.03, why:0.03, widow:0.05, will:0.04, with:0.13, work:0.03, worth:0.03, would:0.02, written:0.04, you:0.03"
2012-05-06,"The Avengers has been years in the making. The budget, cast, director, and storyline show just how much effort has been put into this movie. The graphics are unbeatable. The director was able to bring life to the characters while making the film as fast-passed as it needed to be. To top it off, the cast bill consisted of Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, and many more. The storyline was unlike anything I have seen in a superhero movie before (although it did remind me of Chronicle at times).The only problem with The Avengers is the script that Joss Whedon wrote. He may be a great director, but that does not mean he should also be a screenwriter. With such talented actors, far too many lines were simplified or dropped completely. At times, the dialogue just feels like filler until the action starts again. However, there is one upside to having Joss Whedon do the screenplay: he's quite funny. From a remark about Legalas to plenty of Hulk jokes, he knows how to make a theatre roll with laughter.One of the fears that comes with making a beloved book/comic book into a movie is that it will be difficult to follow if you are not a fan. I, for one, have never picked up a comic book in my life. Aside from minor aspects (the scene after the credits, the science behind superpowers, etc.), there is almost nothing in The Avengers that will trip you up. There is even enough backstory in the first hour of the movie that you don't need to have seen the five ""prequels.""With a $200 million opening weekend, The Avengers will likely go down as one of the highest grossing movies of all time—next to Star Wars IV, Star Wars I, Titanic, The Dark Knight, and Avatar. Although The Avengers fits in well with these movies, it is rather unique. The studio behind this movie—Universal—was able to manufacture this monster of a film by carefully crafting teaser movies over the past several years. It is quite unlike anything the movie industry has ever seen. The Avengers may not be the best movie out there, but it will be known as a game-changer in the movie industry. Expect movie ""teaser movies"" and ""manufactured blockbusters"" in the years ahead.To be perfectly honest, the only people who shouldn't see this movie are those who don't like action movies. The Avengers is nowhere close to being one of the best movies of the year. However, it will go down in history. Not only as a movie that smashed box office records, but as the movie that changed the meaning of blockbuster. Like ""Jaws"" and ""Towering Inferno"" of the 1970s, this movie will change the course of Hollywood and how studios vie for the top spot at the box office.reillyreviews.wordpress.com",7.0,2012-05,Sunday,"able:0.10, about:0.03, action:0.04, actors:0.04, after:0.03, again:0.04, all:0.02, almost:0.04, also:0.03, although:0.09, and:0.08, anything:0.08, are:0.06, as:0.11, at:0.07, avengers:0.13, be:0.14, been:0.06, before:0.04, being:0.03, best:0.05, blockbuster:0.04, book:0.10, bring:0.05, but:0.05, by:0.02, cast:0.07, characters:0.02, comes:0.04, comic:0.06, course:0.04, credits:0.05, dark:0.04, dialogue:0.04, did:0.03, director:0.11, do:0.03, does:0.03, don:0.06, down:0.08, downey:0.03, enough:0.04, even:0.03, ever:0.03, expect:0.04, fan:0.04, far:0.04, feels:0.05, film:0.04, first:0.03, for:0.03, from:0.04, funny:0.04, go:0.06, great:0.02, has:0.07, have:0.06, having:0.04, he:0.10, hollywood:0.05, hour:0.05, how:0.09, however:0.08, hulk:0.02, if:0.03, in:0.14, into:0.06, is:0.12, it:0.11, jackson:0.04, johansson:0.04, joss:0.06, jr:0.03, just:0.05, knight:0.04, life:0.08, like:0.07, lines:0.04, make:0.03, making:0.12, many:0.06, mark:0.03, may:0.08, me:0.03, more:0.02, movie:0.21, movies:0.14, much:0.03, my:0.02, need:0.04, never:0.03, next:0.04, not:0.08, nothing:0.04, of:0.18, off:0.03, one:0.10, only:0.08, or:0.02, out:0.02, over:0.03, past:0.05, people:0.03, perfectly:0.05, put:0.04, quite:0.08, rather:0.05, robert:0.03, ruffalo:0.03, samuel:0.04, scarlett:0.04, scene:0.04, script:0.04, see:0.02, seen:0.09, should:0.04, show:0.04, star:0.09, storyline:0.10, such:0.04, superhero:0.03, that:0.13, the:0.57, there:0.09, these:0.03, this:0.07, those:0.04, time:0.02, times:0.08, to:0.18, too:0.03, top:0.08, until:0.05, up:0.05, was:0.05, well:0.02, were:0.03, whedon:0.06, while:0.04, who:0.05, will:0.16, with:0.11, year:0.04, years:0.11, you:0.06"
2012-08-12,"I have been waiting for an Avengers movie for well over a decade and when I found out that it was even in the pipeline I was beside myself with excitement. I went to see the movie with somewhat high expectations due to the cast involved and the previous Marvel movies building up to this title. I have to say that it completely surpassed my expectations and I was amazed throughout the entire movie. I attended the screening in 3D and I honestly have no idea why people had anything bad to say about the 3D in this movie as it was quite brilliant. For me, the underrated characters in the movie are Black Widow and Hawkeye. I felt that these characters were portrayed perfectly by Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner. I also felt that we have finally found a perfect actor in Mark Ruffalo to play The Hulk. The two actors that have recently played Bruce Banner/The Hulk have been pretty good but both seemed to be lacking in something but I could never put my finger on it. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and The Hulk.Overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie. It also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness. I can see exactly why there has been a massive explosion of potential Marvel movies in the pipeline and I cannot wait to see what the sequel could bring. I feel that Hawkeye and Black Widow could definitely have their own movies if not a movie where they are working together. I also hope that the people at Marvel and Disney have identified Mark Ruffalo's great ability to play Bruce Banner/The Hulk in such a great way and maybe look into rebooting the entire franchise.I would highly recommend this movie across all age ranges as there is something for everyone.

2012-05-14,"This movie has been a long time coming as it had its beginning in the 2008 film ""Iron Man"". There would also be ""The Incredible Hulk"", ""Iron Man 2"", ""Thor"" and finally ""Captain America"". All these parts, left some wondering could they have this many superheroes in a film and it not turn out a jumbled mess? I never wondered that as all one had to do was look at the X-Men films and see that for the most part those films got it right, the main difference here was that different companies were involved so there may be some trouble. However, what we got was a film that brought a team of superheroes together and totally cranked up the action to the max. Yes, I have to say the action in this film is better than any action in other comic book films. It is not even close, they gave me here what I have been wanting! Do not get me wrong, the Batman movies are still great, I also enjoyed the Spider-man and X-men films, but this one just said this is a comic book film, and people want to see an epic battle, maybe even more than one! So no good, but relatively short fights like those found in most comic book films, we get lots of action and an epic finale! My favorite character on the Avengers is the Hulk, which explains why I did enjoy this film a good deal. He was finally done right, granted ""The Incredible Hulk"" was good too, but this was the best representation of the Hulk easily. He was presented as the strongest by far, though I nearly gasped when he and Thor faced off as I never saw that in the trailers so that was a nice treat for me and he did to Thor just what I wanted him to, punch him through something! Granted, Thor got some good hits in too, but I loved how they made it clear Hulk is the strongest one! Mark Ruffalo was also an improvement over Eric Bana and Edward Norton. He played Banner in a bit more nervous and skittish manner, unlike say Norton's who looked capable of putting up a fight without even becoming the Hulk. Hulk also got the biggest laugh in the theater I was in.So this film was everything I was hoping for and more. The rest of the cast was good too as Loki has come to Earth to capture the power of the cosmic cube (though he has someone behind him calling the shots). He plans of bringing an alien force to Earth so that he may become its king, he does this for no other reason than to irritate his brother, Thor it seems. He is still the same Loki from Thor, as you still do not know what he has going on in his mind! I was afraid he would not have this aspect in this film, but they were able to keep it. His alien force is great, and this makes for the great finale!The finale has the Avengers assembling and working together to stop the invasion and it is a grand spectacle to behold! So loved seeing the heroes utilize their skills and powers and every hero gets in some good hits. Black Widow and Hawkeye are expanded on in this film and they are pretty cool. If I were to have a complaint, it would be that there was one hero they under utilized a bit. In a film with so many heroes I guess it is to be expected, I was just surprised it was Captain America. He just did not play as big a role in the final fight as I would of liked. Sure he gave some orders, but his contribution to ending the assault was giving the Black Widow a boost. However, he was used well in the other scenes he was in, this is not a major gripe mind you...just if I can find something to complain about it is this. So in conclusion, I was impressed and loved this film. It was great to see this band of heroes slowly unite as it was watching Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury pulling the strings to get them to work together. Surprised he was listed last in the credit sequence at the end, because he played the most significant role in the film and was in it from the beginning to the end. The way it is performing at the box office also makes me think there is going to be a sequel for sure and that makes me ecstatic as they show who was calling all the shots and suffice to say I was not entirely sure who he was until he smiled and then I am like ""oh my god, yes!"" See this DC and Warner Bros, if multiple companies can come together and make an epic superhero team film then you can make a Justice League movie!",10.0,2012-05,Monday,"able:0.03, about:0.02, action:0.05, alien:0.05, all:0.03, also:0.09, am:0.02, america:0.03, an:0.07, and:0.22, any:0.02, are:0.04, as:0.13, at:0.04, avengers:0.02, banner:0.02, batman:0.03, battle:0.02, be:0.06, because:0.02, become:0.03, been:0.04, beginning:0.06, best:0.02, better:0.02, big:0.02, biggest:0.03, bit:0.05, black:0.04, book:0.07, brother:0.03, brought:0.03, but:0.06, by:0.02, can:0.05, captain:0.03, cast:0.02, character:0.02, come:0.04, comic:0.06, coming:0.03, cool:0.03, could:0.02, did:0.06, different:0.03, do:0.06, does:0.02, done:0.02, earth:0.05, end:0.04, enjoy:0.03, enjoyed:0.03, epic:0.09, even:0.05, every:0.02, everything:0.02, expected:0.03, far:0.02, favorite:0.03, fight:0.05, film:0.18, films:0.10, final:0.03, finally:0.05, find:0.03, for:0.06, found:0.03, from:0.03, fury:0.02, get:0.05, gets:0.03, giving:0.03, god:0.03, going:0.04, good:0.09, got:0.10, great:0.06, had:0.03, has:0.07, have:0.06, hawkeye:0.02, he:0.32, here:0.04, hero:0.04, heroes:0.06, him:0.07, his:0.07, how:0.02, however:0.05, hulk:0.10, if:0.05, in:0.21, incredible:0.05, iron:0.03, is:0.12, it:0.14, its:0.04, jackson:0.02, just:0.07, keep:0.03, know:0.02, last:0.02, left:0.03, like:0.03, liked:0.03, loki:0.03, long:0.02, look:0.03, loved:0.08, made:0.02, main:0.03, make:0.04, makes:0.07, man:0.04, many:0.04, mark:0.02, may:0.05, maybe:0.03, me:0.08, mind:0.06, more:0.05, most:0.05, movie:0.02, movies:0.01, my:0.03, never:0.04, nice:0.03, nick:0.02, no:0.04, norton:0.06, not:0.10, of:0.08, off:0.02, on:0.04, one:0.06, other:0.05, out:0.02, over:0.02, part:0.02, parts:0.03, people:0.02, play:0.03, played:0.05, power:0.03, powers:0.03, pretty:0.02, reason:0.03, rest:0.03, right:0.05, role:0.05, ruffalo:0.02, said:0.03, same:0.02, samuel:0.02, saw:0.03, say:0.06, scenes:0.02, see:0.06, seeing:0.03, seems:0.03, sequel:0.03, short:0.03, show:0.03, so:0.11, some:0.08, something:0.05, still:0.06, stop:0.03, superhero:0.02, superheroes:0.04, sure:0.08, team:0.04, than:0.05, that:0.09, the:0.37, theater:0.03, their:0.02, them:0.02, then:0.04, there:0.06, these:0.02, they:0.10, think:0.02, this:0.16, thor:0.09, those:0.05, though:0.05, through:0.03, time:0.01, to:0.20, together:0.07, too:0.06, until:0.03, up:0.03, used:0.03, want:0.02, was:0.31, watching:0.02, way:0.02, we:0.04, well:0.02, were:0.05, what:0.06, when:0.02, which:0.02, who:0.05, why:0.02, widow:0.04, with:0.01, without:0.02, work:0.02, would:0.07, wrong:0.03, yes:0.06, you:0.04"

Those movies that people will enjoy for decades to come? I'm stunned how well this has been received. Anyone over the age of 7 that has given this film a good review should be ashamed. The absolute saturation of CGI is disgusting, and seems to be enough to forgive the many flaws of this movie. The action is as poor as the humor, which is brutal. I'm not against the Marvel characters, I grew up with them. I know you can't go into certain movies with a critical eye, all I expected from my trip to the cinema was to be entertained. Instead I was saddened, shocked and bored to the point of irritation. I seen the amazing Spider-Man recently, THAT was entertaining.

2012-05-07,"It is the film to watch!This movie is the best ever superhero film I have ever seen. I was expecting a ""Michael Bay style"" movie with nothing but CGI, but there is so much more to flashing lights in this movie (unlike Transformers 2,3).The character clash worked really well as some scenes included just the heroes communicating and interacting. The characters were all brilliant with a superb cast e.g Downey Jr. But the Actor that stood out the most was none the less than Mark Ruffalo (where has he been all this time?. This guy fits so well into the clothes of Bruce Banner, as he really portrays the human and the scientific side of the hulk, he also shows the battle with him self that he is constantly fighting. The Hulk in this movie was expected,lets be honest, to be a 'side character' instead he was a BEAST, no, better THE HULK. I also liked how Lou Ferigno makes his cameo as the voice of the Hulk. As for the rest of characters such as Iron Man,Captain America and Thor they all shared really equally big roles. Black Widow's character is not only the 'pretty face' but, an extremely shrewd woman. Perfect woman? Or is it just me? Hawkeye the last character, like we all expected draws the short straw, but not as short as you would expect, as he is seen doing some amazing stuff. The Antagonist Loky has a great impact in the movie, as the contrast of characters between Him and Thor, Tony Stark and the rest escalates the tension to breaking point.The film adopts a light hearted feel at times, which smooths the film with some light humour. The visuals were incredible, especially with the Hulk transformation (finnally we get to see that) and the battles.I would suggest watching Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, the Incredible Hulk and the first Avenger (find out the order on IMDb) before you watch the avengers. Remember if you have not gone Cinema to watch it yet, stay till the very END.{Unfortunately for me i think i know how avengers 2 is going to end to find out my imaginary ending search up Spider man 1994 episode 57...

2012-04-24,"The critics so far are basically right about what makes it great. Virtually all of the reviewers have said it has excellent dialogue and great action set pieces.No one who is a fan of fantasy action movies could seriously deny how good this is as an action spectacle: the special effects are very good, and put to good use by Whedon and his team. The tracking shot through the midst of the final battle is amazing. The finale is a genuine classic battle scene, and is as good as anything that Steven Spielberg would have put together in the same circumstances.The movie is funny enough that IMDb should add 'comedy' to its genre list. And all the other things the critics are repeating (so far, anyway) are true: mostly good acting, Ruffalo is especially good as Banner, character interactions are done very well, everyone gets enough to do that it feels like an ensemble movie, all of the title characters from the prior films are portrayed as well, or better than, in their own films blah blah blah...So all the good stuff we've been hearing/reading is basically true. What about the bad? There's less consensus around the bad, but probably general agreement that the plot as such isn't all that. It's basically the story as told on the cover of The Avengers comic #1: a team of powerful, but not unstoppable, individuals gather together to fight a foe no hero could stop alone. As Time Out's reviewer noted, the plot is basically just a coat-hanger for Whedon to build his character arcs and action sequences. But The Avengers was always likely to be limited by the need to be an origin story of sorts, and so I wasn't really expecting a lot more from the plot on this occasion; and the storytelling itself is very good, the way the character arcs were moved forward and entwined, was done very well. The alien army was an adequate, but not very innovative way to get Loki reinforcements and get a big battle for the heroes at the climax.The beginning was a bit clunky (several reviewers have used exactly that word) and I don't think it was a very helpful way to get audiences who hadn't seen the build-up movies into the film.There are potentially interesting themes of control, power and freedom (as Patrick Samuel touched on in his review at Static Mass Emporium), but these are not given sufficient fleshing out, leaving the movie in the 'summer blockbuster' category, albeit a much, much better than average example of that kind.Oh, and I'll say it again: The official title is stupid.But overall, I'd give it a 9/10.

2012-05-12,"Clippy, extremely lore-crammed launch of the first major big-screen Marvel Comics teamup goes a little too much into the anime-type features and weaponry of the SHIELD spy agency and its monochromatic personnel during its first half but soon settles into a huge yet decently Medea-theme-motivated exploration of the superhero identity, and an occasionally funny action film based upon several evolving lines of the comic characters' histories (non-readers who know little if anything of the arcane intricacies of the Marvel Amazing Fantasy/Strange Tales/Tales of Suspense/Ultimate Avengers lines will find this a bit of a slog) as SHIELD's eyepatched lead agent Nick Fury's agency's base is invaded by the Norse god/trickster, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who steals a new intergalactic energy cube called the Tessaract for the invading alien race called the Chitauri. Fury, with the help of the slinky, red-headed Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) organizes the participation of a small group of terrrestrials/magnates/scientists better known as the Hulk (a pleasantly-greyed Mark Ruffalo)/Iron Man/Thor (the sturdy Chris Hemsworth)/Captain America a.k.a. the Avengers, who recently had a variety of individual adventures but are now needed to defeat Loki and send the Chitauri back to their interdimensional plane. The film's unexplained, insistently locale-centered structuring—weaving from a destroyed SHIELD hidden land base to their floating battleship called a helicarrier, where the Avengers collect and argue their theories—seems almost at cross-purposes at times from the charmingly insultive, rowdy, obdurate band of costumed characters getting some help from the crunching sound-effects and punchy yet glacial camera-work. Director Joss Whedon is not David Lean or even Superman I's Richard Donner (he doesn't seem to know how to subtly build grand and stacked sequences or use scale into centered release points for the audience to invite them into constant rousing applause for these 'heroes'). But Whedon does evoke a non-cynical appreciation of these characters minds (Chris Evans' Captain America is as much a straight shooter as straight arrow) and hearts (Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark/cardiac-wounded Iron Man probably comes off the most believable considering he had two full screen adventures of his own, yet the character's mogulistic resources—enough to bankrupt several continents—beggar the question as to why he would need SHIELD at all instead of starting his own superhero gang), and their clear-cut stagings and streaking, powerful choreography even during the most complicated effects scenes does make the appropriate impact. Once the Avengers assemble to defend New York City against a final invasion of giant slug-like creatures and Chitauri attackers THE AVENGERS illustrates the dichotomy of current genre epics, written for tween or undiscriminating audiences yet grandly casting decently talented actors in noble roles for the staying power of a halfway legitimate drama, and settling for digital-image glorification of a superhero costume instead.",6.0,2012-05,Saturday,"action:0.03, actors:0.05, against:0.06, agent:0.06, alien:0.05, all:0.02, almost:0.05, amazing:0.04, america:0.06, an:0.03, and:0.20, anything:0.05, are:0.03, as:0.12, assemble:0.06, at:0.09, audience:0.05, avengers:0.12, back:0.05, better:0.04, big:0.04, bit:0.05, black:0.04, but:0.06, by:0.03, captain:0.06, character:0.03, characters:0.08, chris:0.09, comes:0.05, comic:0.04, comics:0.05, director:0.05, does:0.08, doesn:0.05, downey:0.04, effects:0.07, enough:0.05, evans:0.05, even:0.07, film:0.05, final:0.06, find:0.06, first:0.07, for:0.13, from:0.08, full:0.06, funny:0.05, fury:0.09, genre:0.06, getting:0.06, god:0.05, goes:0.06, group:0.06, had:0.07, half:0.06, he:0.09, help:0.13, hemsworth:0.05, heroes:0.04, hiddleston:0.05, his:0.07, how:0.04, huge:0.05, hulk:0.03, if:0.03, in:0.02, individual:0.06, instead:0.13, into:0.15, iron:0.06, is:0.05, its:0.08, johansson:0.05, joss:0.04, jr:0.04, know:0.08, like:0.03, lines:0.11, little:0.09, loki:0.07, make:0.04, man:0.06, mark:0.04, marvel:0.06, most:0.07, much:0.07, need:0.05, new:0.09, nick:0.04, not:0.02, now:0.04, of:0.34, off:0.04, once:0.05, or:0.09, own:0.09, power:0.06, probably:0.05, robert:0.04, ruffalo:0.04, scarlett:0.04, scenes:0.04, screen:0.08, seem:0.06, seems:0.06, sequences:0.05, some:0.03, stark:0.05, superhero:0.10, the:0.52, their:0.13, them:0.03, these:0.08, this:0.02, thor:0.03, times:0.05, to:0.16, tom:0.05, tony:0.05, too:0.04, two:0.05, whedon:0.07, where:0.04, who:0.10, why:0.05, widow:0.04, will:0.03, with:0.02, work:0.05, would:0.03, written:0.06, yet:0.21, york:0.06"

2012-05-07,"This new superhero flick by ""Marvel"" is quite good. Being a fan of many past Marvel movies, I feel that director Joss Whedon did give most comic book fans a film that they will remember. It is packed with action, costumed superheroes, villains, gadgets, plot-twists, witty dialogue - much like a well written comic strip. However, for those not entirely familiar with the heroes, as well as those who are looking for a more serious plot, they won't find anything deep in this flick. It is, as Roger Ebert put it, ""The Westminster Dogshow of superheroes."" The production team incorporates myriads of digital visual and sonic effects to give film-goers the biggest bang for their buck.Nevertheless, children will find it very exciting, as will most Marvel aficionados.

2020-04-10,"This dated way better than I thought. I can't believe how much this is better than the later Avengers films. Back then it wasn't made only for memes, product placement, popular culture and cheap cliffhangers. The CGI is somehow better than the later films so is the story and everything else. I'm surprised that they dropped the quality so much nowadays yet these films are getting more and more popular somehow. This film has some very cool action scenes, I admit sometimes it has obvious green screen scenes, but for the most part the CGI is very good. The sounds and camera work are pretty great too. This film was kind of groundbreaking in its time because it features multiple superheroes at once which wasn't really done at the time or at least with as many superheroes and such quality.A very good comparison to the later films is the entrance of each superhero. In this film, there are only six main superheroes yet everyone's entrance is memorable and each of them has enough time in the film and takes a huge part of the story. And now look at Infinity War or Endgame which has over 20 superheroes and most of them don't have any impact on the story and barely have any time in those films at all. The assemble has been really watered down.I guess this film drags after the first action scenes, about 10-15 minutes could easily be cut from there, but over than that the pacing is good, it also did not do the overstretched ending which Endgame has. The story itself is pretty good, it could've done a lot worse considering that similar films of the time did not try as hard (Thor, Captain America).Overall this is still one of the best MCU films.",7.0,2020-04,Friday,"10:0.05, about:0.04, action:0.06, after:0.05, all:0.02, also:0.04, america:0.04, and:0.19, any:0.09, are:0.09, as:0.05, assemble:0.06, at:0.16, avengers:0.03, back:0.05, be:0.03, because:0.04, been:0.04, believe:0.06, best:0.04, better:0.13, but:0.05, can:0.03, captain:0.04, cgi:0.11, cool:0.06, could:0.09, did:0.09, do:0.04, don:0.04, done:0.11, down:0.06, each:0.09, else:0.07, enough:0.05, everyone:0.05, everything:0.05, film:0.15, films:0.31, first:0.04, for:0.05, from:0.03, getting:0.07, good:0.13, great:0.03, hard:0.06, has:0.20, have:0.06, how:0.04, huge:0.06, in:0.09, is:0.19, it:0.10, its:0.04, itself:0.07, kind:0.06, least:0.06, look:0.06, lot:0.05, made:0.04, main:0.06, many:0.04, mcu:0.07, minutes:0.07, more:0.07, most:0.08, much:0.08, not:0.05, now:0.05, of:0.14, on:0.03, once:0.06, one:0.03, only:0.08, or:0.07, over:0.09, overall:0.06, part:0.11, pretty:0.11, really:0.07, scenes:0.13, screen:0.05, so:0.06, some:0.04, still:0.05, story:0.15, such:0.05, superhero:0.04, superheroes:0.19, takes:0.07, than:0.16, that:0.07, the:0.39, them:0.08, then:0.05, there:0.07, these:0.04, they:0.03, this:0.14, thor:0.03, those:0.05, thought:0.06, time:0.17, to:0.02, too:0.04, ve:0.05, very:0.11, was:0.03, wasn:0.13, way:0.04, which:0.12, with:0.02, work:0.05, yet:0.12"
2012-06-01,"After the events of Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger and Thor, Loki returns with an army of powerful aliens to take over mankind. But Nick Fury and his company S.H.I.E.L.D., gathers a group of heroes (Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye and Black Widow) to fight back.The Avengers was one of the most anticipated movies of this year. Now I wasn't as hyped for this movie as everyone else were, simply because I wasn't a big fan of any of the superheroes in this movie. Iron Man is pretty cool, but Hulk, Captain America and Thor aren't that interesting in terms of being superheroes. Hawkeye and Black Widow can't even be considered true superheroes, and overall I was disappointed by the lack of Spider-Man, Wolverine and villains from the comics. This movie only has one villain, Loki from Thor. No War Machine, no Red Skull, no Abomination, just Loki. But after studying the trailers a bit more, and after watching all the films building up to The Avengers, I myself was starting to look forward to the movie everyone were begging to see.Now, let me say this: I have never had so much fun watching a movie. It's like a lot of other people also have stated, this movie is so much fun to watch with other people, it's almost unbelievable. The Avengers really is one of those very rare movies that we only get like once or twice a decade. And let me tell you why...First of all, the balance of screen-time and development of the characters is very impressive! It's one of the hard things to do with crossovers. All the characters are also made interesting and likable. Even if they changed the actor for Hulk, he still is Hulk. In fact, the new Hulk is even more Hulk than the previous Hulk! Iron Man is even funnier in this movie than he was in any of the Iron Man films, Captain America is just as likable as he was in The First Avenger and Thor is also back in all his glory.The action is also fantastic. Let me tell you this, the best part about this movie is the last fight scene with The Avengers vs. Loki and his army! It is so amazing, epic and packed with action! Everyone clapped at almost everything that came on-screen! It was just plain spectacular!Now, the main gripe I have with this film is the setting of the mid-part. The middle of the film takes place in an airship. Most of it is just the superheroes trying to keep the ship not from falling apart while fighting some bad-guys. It's not bad by any means, it's just not that special. This mid-part is however redeemed by some amazing dialogue.The Avengers is an awesome movie! It's the movie Marvel fans have been waiting for! The mid-part may not be that great, but the rest of the film is so great it almost doesn't matter.",8.0,2012-06,Friday,"about:0.02, action:0.04, actor:0.04, after:0.09, all:0.07, almost:0.12, also:0.11, amazing:0.06, america:0.09, an:0.06, and:0.17, any:0.09, are:0.02, army:0.08, as:0.07, at:0.02, avenger:0.08, avengers:0.09, awesome:0.03, back:0.07, bad:0.07, be:0.04, because:0.03, been:0.03, being:0.03, best:0.02, big:0.03, bit:0.04, black:0.06, but:0.06, by:0.07, came:0.04, can:0.02, captain:0.10, characters:0.04, comics:0.04, cool:0.04, development:0.04, dialogue:0.04, disappointed:0.04, do:0.03, doesn:0.04, else:0.04, epic:0.04, even:0.10, everyone:0.10, everything:0.03, fact:0.04, fan:0.03, fans:0.04, fantastic:0.04, fight:0.07, fighting:0.04, film:0.06, films:0.06, first:0.08, for:0.05, from:0.06, fun:0.06, fury:0.03, get:0.03, great:0.04, group:0.04, guys:0.04, had:0.03, hard:0.04, has:0.02, have:0.07, hawkeye:0.06, he:0.07, heroes:0.03, his:0.07, however:0.04, hulk:0.16, if:0.02, impressive:0.05, in:0.11, incredible:0.04, interesting:0.08, iron:0.11, is:0.23, it:0.13, just:0.10, keep:0.04, last:0.04, let:0.12, like:0.04, loki:0.10, look:0.04, lot:0.03, made:0.03, main:0.04, man:0.13, marvel:0.02, may:0.04, me:0.07, more:0.05, most:0.05, movie:0.15, movies:0.04, much:0.05, never:0.03, new:0.03, nick:0.03, no:0.08, not:0.07, now:0.10, of:0.26, on:0.02, once:0.04, one:0.07, only:0.05, or:0.02, other:0.05, over:0.03, overall:0.04, packed:0.04, part:0.14, people:0.06, place:0.05, pretty:0.04, previous:0.04, really:0.02, rest:0.04, say:0.03, scene:0.03, screen:0.06, see:0.02, simply:0.04, so:0.08, some:0.05, special:0.03, spectacular:0.05, still:0.03, superheroes:0.12, take:0.04, takes:0.04, than:0.05, that:0.08, the:0.46, they:0.02, things:0.04, this:0.15, thor:0.11, those:0.03, time:0.02, to:0.12, true:0.04, up:0.02, very:0.05, villain:0.03, was:0.10, wasn:0.08, watch:0.03, watching:0.07, we:0.03, were:0.05, while:0.04, why:0.03, widow:0.06, with:0.10, year:0.04, you:0.04"
2012-04-25,"I just came out of the cinemas from watching it on the first day and I have to admit it was better than I expected. I expected an action movie with awesome graphics and fight scenes, and that's what you get, world class entertainment. I enjoyed the character development and subtle hints that give a bigger meaning. Also this movie has a chunk of comedy, not the annoying kind but the kind that blends into the movie perfectly to give you a laugh but not take away the seriousness of the film (too much). It was cliché but what can you expect. The actor's are flawless and keep up with who they are meant to be. The only part I really didn't like, but also didn't expect was the lack of feeling. A lot of the good movies I watch I come out feeling different, like the movie has effected me, but I felt nothing, (except for one part but it wasn't enough to give a real feeling to the movie).

2012-05-05,"This is it. This is what the nerd world has been waiting for for so long. Almost every Marvel movie since Iron Man has been alluding to this film and we've all been so anxiously awaiting the first assembly of the Avengers, Marvel's ultimate superhero alliance. The Avengers unites Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Hulk, and Hawkeye, making them a superhero team of epic proportions all brought together by Nick Fury. The film tells the story of the forming of the Avengers as they are forced together in order to stop Loki, Thor's mischievous brother, from waging an intergalactic war on Earth. The ensuing battle is one that strives to be of epic proportions.To say that The Avengers lived up to its hype would be giving it too much credit. To say it is a letdown would be too harsh. With the recent quality of superhero movies The Avengers was about as good as you could expect. It's a little simplistic, doesn't go too deep, yet it stands to be a hell of a lot of fun, and there's nothing wrong with that. After watching the slew of superhero movies that have come out in the last 3 or 4 years this is what we have been waiting for, and it essentially doesn't let us down. It's what we want to see when watching all these great superheroes come together to fight the forces of evil. The action is great and they dynamics between our diverse cast of heroes are excellent.It is almost a requirement that you watch the previous Marvel movies to fully understand the relationships developing here, such as Loki's significance and why exactly he is after the Tesserac, an artifact that can open portals to different worlds. Yet, at the same time, there is a lot of undeveloped story for some of the other characters. Black Widow and Hawkeye are the two that most come to mind. Black Widow appeared multiple times in the Iron Man films and we got a feel for her there, but Hawkeye was only treated to about 30 seconds of screen time in Thor. Yet in The Avengers we have to assume a lot of information about his character, as we don't get to learn much about him. It almost feels as if there should have been a Hawkeye movie released before this one.However, this Hawkeye dilemma highlights one aspect of the film that can be good for some and bad for others. There is a lot going on in this film and it has to move very fast, even for a two and a half hour film. This is the reason the story is kept fairly simple and the bulk of the film focuses on bringing together the film's ensemble and, of course, the action, which is nothing short of awesome. You can expect great explosions, awesome fights, and breathtaking CGI throughout the whole film and, while it is nothing exceptional, it makes The Avengers what it is, a summer blockbuster. The Avengers isn't the superhero film to end all superhero films, but it is certainly a lot of fun. There's no reason you shouldn't enjoy the film if you sit back and relax and watch the excitement unfold.",7.0,2012-05,Saturday,"about:0.09, action:0.04, after:0.06, all:0.06, almost:0.11, america:0.02, an:0.04, and:0.20, are:0.05, as:0.10, at:0.02, avengers:0.14, awesome:0.07, back:0.03, bad:0.03, battle:0.04, be:0.09, been:0.13, before:0.03, between:0.03, black:0.08, blockbuster:0.04, brother:0.04, brought:0.04, but:0.03, by:0.02, can:0.07, captain:0.02, cast:0.03, certainly:0.04, cgi:0.03, character:0.02, characters:0.02, come:0.09, could:0.03, course:0.04, different:0.04, doesn:0.07, don:0.03, down:0.04, earth:0.03, end:0.03, enjoy:0.04, ensemble:0.04, epic:0.08, even:0.02, every:0.03, evil:0.04, excellent:0.04, expect:0.08, feel:0.03, feels:0.04, fight:0.03, film:0.19, films:0.06, first:0.03, for:0.12, from:0.02, fun:0.06, fury:0.03, get:0.03, giving:0.04, go:0.03, going:0.03, good:0.04, got:0.04, great:0.06, half:0.04, has:0.06, have:0.07, hawkeye:0.15, he:0.02, her:0.04, here:0.03, heroes:0.03, him:0.03, his:0.02, hour:0.04, however:0.04, hulk:0.02, hype:0.04, if:0.05, in:0.08, iron:0.06, is:0.21, isn:0.04, it:0.18, its:0.03, last:0.04, let:0.04, little:0.03, loki:0.05, long:0.03, lot:0.15, makes:0.03, making:0.04, man:0.06, marvel:0.06, mind:0.04, most:0.03, movie:0.03, movies:0.06, much:0.05, nick:0.03, no:0.03, nothing:0.10, of:0.25, on:0.06, one:0.05, only:0.03, or:0.02, other:0.02, others:0.04, our:0.04, out:0.02, previous:0.04, reason:0.08, same:0.03, say:0.06, screen:0.03, see:0.02, short:0.04, should:0.03, simple:0.04, since:0.04, so:0.04, some:0.05, stop:0.04, story:0.07, such:0.03, summer:0.04, superhero:0.15, superheroes:0.03, team:0.03, that:0.12, the:0.43, them:0.02, there:0.13, these:0.03, they:0.04, this:0.10, thor:0.06, throughout:0.04, time:0.04, times:0.04, to:0.21, together:0.10, too:0.08, two:0.07, understand:0.04, up:0.02, us:0.04, ve:0.03, very:0.02, want:0.03, was:0.03, watch:0.05, watching:0.06, we:0.17, what:0.09, when:0.02, which:0.03, while:0.03, whole:0.04, why:0.03, widow:0.08, with:0.03, world:0.03, would:0.05, wrong:0.04, years:0.03, yet:0.11, you:0.09"

And speaking of Mark Ruffalo and his Hulk character.I have to admit for a few minutes of thinking, ""What the heck good is this as a Super Hero? All he does is get mad and smash things. What kind of help is this?"" And of course, this being a proper Super Hero movie, The Hulk eventually becomes useful rather than simply destructive and clears up most of those doubts.

2012-04-21,"I am not going to go into any spoilers or tell people to go see this movie, I am sure if you are reading these review you are already going to go see the movie. I also will not go into all the awesome things that went down at this early screening in Century City like; an unexpected visit by some major people who were lightly involved with the movie..........nobody that contributed that much..just Joss Whedon, Kevin Feige, Chris Hemsworth, and Loki himself, Tom Hiddleston but who cares about that, oh wait.....everybody there!!!OK so now for the review....I believe this movie is everything it is hyped up to be, I am not going to go into all the things I could praise about this movie because there are so many things and it would take awhile. HOWEVER, I will state the two things that I have a minor ""PROBLEM"" with and should be the only ""COMPLAINTS"" about this movie. 1. Joss Whedon said that he CUT the original movie down from 3 HOURS down to 2 hours and 15 minutes, this is something you will definitely notice if you pay enough attention. This leaves room for some ""out of place"" scenes and some fully unexplained situations, but I am guessing it was the studio's decision to do this so don't blame Joss because he did a great job with this enormous task. 2. The reason why this film might gain LESS critical ACCLAMATION then dark knight rises, or ANY OTHER comic book movie, is because of the huge load of Characters that this movie has to balance. I am not saying they are not handled perfectly, BUT it is still much different then a movie with ONE central HERO. All of these main heroes have had their OWN movies, you will need to remember this in order to properly weigh how Joss Whedon handled all of them together. Overall, I think almost anybody will thoroughly enjoy this movie, whether you just like action movies or whether you sit around waiting for new Avengers news to come out.

2012-04-26,"The movie starts off slow while the plot takes shape and everyone is brought up to speed on the threat the Earth will soon face. A little too much time is spent with the 'peripheral' characters; black widow, Hawkman and Fury but from the moment that one of the key protagonists first goes toe to toe with Loki, the film picks up pace. What follows is entertaining but I think keener fans of the marvel universe will feel the middle of the film comes just short of delivering expectations. For example a fight match-up that was mean't for the big-screen including two of the most powerful of the entourage left me asking for more. All is forgiven though as the action gets better and better throughout and by then end when you think you've seen the finale it just keeps going. The last 30 minutes of the film is the best of any superhero flick to date though I do wonder if the budget for CGI could have been spread across the earlier parts of the film less thinly. The humor throughout is hilarious though at moments it risks taking the material not seriously enough as though the cameras stopped rolling and everyone can stop pretending to be superheroes. One of the heroes is the butt of the joke more often than fair and doesn't get so many memorable lines or opportunities to show off like the others so if you happened to pick this one as a favorite you might be a little disappointed if not for the fact that the others in the entourage do kick so much ass.",8.0,2012-04,Thursday,"action:0.03, all:0.03, and:0.12, any:0.05, as:0.09, at:0.03, be:0.06, been:0.04, best:0.04, better:0.09, big:0.05, black:0.04, brought:0.07, but:0.05, by:0.04, can:0.04, cgi:0.06, characters:0.03, comes:0.06, could:0.05, disappointed:0.07, do:0.09, doesn:0.06, earth:0.06, end:0.05, enough:0.06, entertaining:0.06, everyone:0.11, expectations:0.07, face:0.08, fact:0.07, fans:0.06, favorite:0.06, feel:0.06, fight:0.06, film:0.13, first:0.04, for:0.13, from:0.03, fury:0.05, get:0.04, gets:0.06, goes:0.07, going:0.05, have:0.03, heroes:0.04, humor:0.06, if:0.11, in:0.02, is:0.15, it:0.04, just:0.07, last:0.06, left:0.07, less:0.07, like:0.03, lines:0.07, little:0.11, loki:0.04, many:0.05, marvel:0.04, me:0.04, might:0.07, minutes:0.07, moment:0.07, moments:0.06, more:0.07, most:0.04, movie:0.02, much:0.08, not:0.06, of:0.23, off:0.10, on:0.03, one:0.09, or:0.04, others:0.13, parts:0.07, plot:0.05, screen:0.05, seen:0.05, short:0.07, show:0.06, so:0.10, stop:0.07, superhero:0.04, superheroes:0.05, takes:0.07, than:0.04, that:0.07, the:0.62, then:0.05, think:0.09, this:0.02, though:0.23, throughout:0.15, time:0.04, to:0.12, too:0.05, two:0.06, universe:0.07, up:0.11, ve:0.05, was:0.03, what:0.04, when:0.04, while:0.06, widow:0.05, will:0.08, with:0.05, you:0.12"

2012-07-19,"The Avengers finally assembled this year and I believe as everybody does that it is awesome. It in a sense is a flawless because it does everything that it is trying to and does it well. It's just as good as it needed to be and more. However, is it cinematic genius and one of the greatest films of all time? No. It's loads and loads of fun, the action scenes are great, the dialog is very witty, and the acting is good. But that's pretty much it. I'm not downgrading the movie at all. Everyone should see it and it is great, but it doesn't take any risks. It's a safe film, with nothing really unexpected. Asides from The Dark Knight, it is the best superhero movie thus far(still waiting for Dark Knight Rises), but it's the basic ""take over the world"" plot and there's just nothing that isn't surprising in the movie. Is it a good film? Yes. It's even a great film and does what it's trying to do perfectly. But is it the 49th best movie ever? Far far from it.

2013-08-17,"Nick Fury brings together Earth's mightiest heroes to stop Loki who is unleashing an alien invasion.Robert Downey Jr. makes this good and Joss Whedon makes this great. Downey has already shown that he's a movie star. He could power a whole franchise all by himself but the Avengers is more than just a one man team. This is a quintessential Joss Whedon Scooby gang, and he's great at the snappy dialog and friend-hate comradry. This is a whole team of heroes working together.Because of its timing, this will be compared to The Dark Knight Rises. Most seems to give TDKR more credit because of its darker grittier tone. Both are great but I like Avengers better. Honestly, TDKR is inferior to TDK. There are logic problems with TDKR. There are too many comic-book moves in that film. It's melodramatic in its emotionally manipulations. The Avengers is simply better written. Its dialog is better.

2012-06-24,"Well what I found so humorous was one of my female cousin text and said ""Did you see The Avengers?"". Mind you she's not into Marvel movies at all and thought that was an excellent movie. You know I had to go see it even more. What's great about The Avengers, you don't have to see the other Marvel movies to follow the plot. However, it would be helpful to have a vague knowledge on each superhero. The Avengers makes me want to go back to my library to review the other Marvel movies I saw to put the puzzle together. I was rattling my brain when I saw Samuel Jackson and couldn't recall which Marvel flicks he was in. All the superheros got a fair amount of spot light, unpredictable plot, tones of actions, over 2 hours, and excellent visual effects.

2012-05-21,"I went into the Avengers with  no expectations. I'm not really all that big on the super hero movies, but I don't dislike them either. I have at least seen all the newest Spiderman, Batman, Iron Man, and Hulk movies, being a teenage boy. However, when I heard about the Avengers, I just thought it sounded stupid. Then, when it was released, I kept hearing great things. So I thought, ""maybe"". Then, when some friends invited me to go see it in IMAX, I thought ""Scarlett Johansson on a screen the size of my house? Heck yes!"" So, I was pretty open minded. And it was great.I don't want to give too many spoilers, so I'll just break it into sections: Acting- 8/10      Robert Downey Jr. gave a great performance as the narcissistic billionaire, Tony Stark. I thought his lines were very well scripted- some of the best in the movie, and he delivered them well.       Chris Evans did well in his part as the confused Captain America, who is still used to living in the 1940's (you will be slightly confused unless you've seen CA- I watched it afterward and it cleared things up). I do think he was slightly out shined by RDJ, who really stole the show, but they both did a great job playing off of each other to show the tension between them.     It is a little hard for me to pass judgement on Scarlett Johansson's performance, as I was slightly distracted  (and by slightly I mean very) by her hotness, but I think she did well.      Mark Ruffalo did quite well as the tortured Bruce Banner. He managed to create a complex, layered character with what was possibly fewer lines than any of the other super heroes in the movie. (don't quote me on that)      Chris Hemsworth did surprisingly well as Thor, also. I watched Thor last night and was very underwhelmed with his performance. It doesn't even compare to the Avengers.     Jeremy Renner did OK as Agent Barton, though I felt he tried to play up the ""Bad-A Mercenary guy"" a little too much.      Tom Hiddleston did very well as Loki, once again. I was impressed with him in Thor as well (he was just about the only one). He portrayed a bad guy that was, without a doubt, a bad guy, but that maybe was just a little misled and misunderstood as well. He managed to make a lot of little, as his character was one aspect where I felt the writing flopped a little bit.      Clark Gregg did fine as Agent Coulson, though his character was  different than in the previous movies.      Cobie Smulders was just OK. I think perhaps shes more suited for comedy.      Samuel Jackson did great as Nick Fury, as expected.Plot- 7/10 It was much better than I expected.

2012-04-28,"Earth's Mightiest Heroes come together under one roof, led in battle by the perfect soldier himself Captain America, to face the Asgardian Villain Loki or as Hulk put it ""Pewny god"".First thing, what happens when u put Bruce Banner and Thor in a vessel way up in the sky and then Banner sets Hulk loose?Chaos like no other.I have to say watching this film will put you at the edge of your sit for the total 2hours 15mins. Sadly to say Nick Fury's (Samuel L Jackson) acting was the weakest among the group and Mark Ruffalo's was the best.But the hero to watch out for is the Hulk, this massive walking gamma radiation will make you laugh, trip, and then roll on the fall clutching your ribs.You don't believe me? Go get a dose of The Avengers.This movie is CGI invasion, almost everything at the final frontier (final battle) was CGI incorporated. So well crafted was the CGI and so well mastered were the actors themselves that they flowed with the scenes with ease.The comic relief in the movie were both The Hulk/Banner and Thor, these were the high notes:1. When they took down an invading alien ship 2. When Hulk and Loki met face to face. 3. When Banner and Thor discussed Loki.I felt the comic relief was well crafted into the movie; kudos to the script, the screenplay and cinematography were also on point.The screenplay was done by Joss Whedon who worked on Buffy The Vampire Slayer, he made every scene especially the fight and battle scenes so interesting a sight. The comedy/action scenes were precise and will leave you gasping for breath, as you never expect them. Even now that I told you where they are still... you won't see it coming, trust me.Directing in its part had to be done by a master director, because having all this heroes together, you have to be able to mix and match, so that none is underutilized and none is hugging the screen time, nice work Joss.And watch out for cool camera angles, one had Captain America assessing a scene and we get to see it from a reflection.Again a wonderful performance by Tom Hiddleston (Loki), when he played Loki in the 2011 Thor, he did it so well I actually thought he knew the guy. Here too he did the same, I hope this won't be the last we hear of him.Wasn't so exciting, was the Iron Man character (although that is my point others may view it differently), his humour always went over my head all through the movie. Black Widow and Hawk Eye, they held their own as they had no powers or a special suit, they made sure they had their share count of dead robotic bad guys. Captain played an important role in the end, but the thing that was worth the watch in his character is the way he was oblivious about things. Thor was graceful as usual, but the Hulk was the icing on the cake.All in all, go see it.",8.0,2012-04,Saturday,"able:0.05, about:0.03, acting:0.03, action:0.02, actors:0.04, actually:0.04, again:0.03, alien:0.04, all:0.07, almost:0.04, also:0.03, although:0.04, always:0.04, america:0.05, an:0.04, and:0.21, are:0.02, as:0.07, at:0.04, avengers:0.02, bad:0.03, banner:0.14, battle:0.11, be:0.06, because:0.03, believe:0.04, best:0.02, black:0.03, both:0.04, bruce:0.04, but:0.05, by:0.09, captain:0.07, cgi:0.11, character:0.05, come:0.03, comedy:0.04, comic:0.06, coming:0.05, cool:0.04, did:0.06, director:0.04, don:0.03, done:0.07, down:0.04, earth:0.04, end:0.03, especially:0.04, even:0.03, every:0.03, everything:0.04, exciting:0.05, expect:0.04, face:0.15, felt:0.04, fight:0.04, film:0.02, final:0.09, first:0.03, for:0.06, from:0.02, fury:0.03, get:0.06, go:0.06, god:0.04, group:0.04, guy:0.04, guys:0.04, had:0.11, have:0.04, having:0.04, he:0.15, here:0.03, hero:0.03, heroes:0.06, hiddleston:0.04, high:0.04, him:0.03, his:0.05, hope:0.05, hulk:0.13, humour:0.05, in:0.13, interesting:0.04, into:0.03, iron:0.02, is:0.08, it:0.08, its:0.03, jackson:0.04, joss:0.06, last:0.04, like:0.02, loki:0.13, made:0.06, make:0.03, man:0.02, mark:0.03, may:0.04, me:0.05, movie:0.06, my:0.05, never:0.03, nice:0.05, nick:0.03, no:0.05, now:0.03, of:0.05, on:0.08, one:0.04, or:0.05, other:0.03, others:0.04, out:0.05, over:0.03, own:0.04, part:0.04, perfect:0.04, performance:0.04, played:0.08, point:0.08, powers:0.05, put:0.12, role:0.04, ruffalo:0.03, same:0.04, samuel:0.04, say:0.06, scene:0.07, scenes:0.09, screen:0.03, script:0.04, see:0.07, so:0.13, special:0.03, still:0.03, sure:0.04, that:0.08, the:0.52, their:0.05, them:0.03, then:0.06, these:0.03, they:0.15, thing:0.07, things:0.04, this:0.07, thor:0.12, thought:0.04, through:0.04, time:0.02, to:0.13, together:0.05, tom:0.03, too:0.03, up:0.02, villain:0.03, was:0.19, wasn:0.04, watch:0.08, watching:0.03, way:0.06, we:0.06, well:0.09, went:0.05, were:0.13, what:0.02, whedon:0.03, when:0.13, where:0.03, who:0.03, widow:0.03, will:0.07, with:0.03, won:0.10, work:0.04, worth:0.04, you:0.15, your:0.07"
2013-03-19,"I want to try to keep this brief because I feel there is need for three separate reviews for this movie, so without further ado;Kids - you'll love it!Now leave the room and let me talk to the adults...Next, comic book geeks - why am I even sharing this with you? You saw the movie over half a year before I did. But then what if you were like me and wanted the hype to die down first or your expectations were feeling a little... strained?Well in case you haven't seen this movie, The Avengers dances provocatively between two different Marvel Universe molds, namely 616 and the Ultimate Universe. No reason, just because somebody said 'Sam Jackson could totally be the black Nick Fury!'In all, without having everybody dressed as they should be - in their original respective battle uniforms - everybody pretty much is as they should be. But the three characters you're going to appreciate the most are Iron Man, Thor and Hulk/Banner. They're just so much better portrayed and their parts are so much more intriguing than Fury, Black Widow and Hawkeye (who in recent years has actually been one of the more interesting characters, no matter what universe we're talking!You will get to see your favourite characters kick ass and interact the way they most likely would and there are a hell of a lot of in-jokes and references to appreciate.Now please leave the room...Okay movie fans and fellow snobs, if you're anything like me, too much noise and activity makes you sleepy rather than lively, especially when they try to make superheroes act and fight as humanly realistically as possible before just deciding 'aaah feck it' and turning them into Mortal Kombat character animations.In fact you know what? Feck it!Pros:1.) Joss Whedon directed marvellously and gave us his best 2.) Character interplay is at many times very fun to watch 3.) The film does not rush from scene to scene like Phantom Menace trying to pretend right in front of your eyes that it is not in fact happening 4.) The backing cast is superb 5.) There is a hell of a lot of bang for your buck and it is mostly excellently executedCons:1.) Hawkeye, Fury and Black Widow seem largely useless 2.) You can tell the actors know it 3.) Captain America comes across as a bloody weakling and spends more time doing acrobatics and being depressed than he does take charge and kick ass 4.) The population of New York City are mindless sheep with no presence, heart or meaning and therefore have no reason for us to care that the Avengers are rescuing them from an alien invasion 5.) The alien invaders didn't have enough time to prove how big a threat they really were before Avengers started stomping them wholesale. This kind of defeats the object of them being a threat.This film however has the potential and I know that Joss Whedon is a perfectionist that will improve with every sequel. I look forward to the next film!P.s - Mark Ruffalo; best actor and best portrayal of Banner there has ever been!",7.0,2013-03,Tuesday,"actor:0.05, actors:0.04, actually:0.04, alien:0.09, all:0.02, am:0.04, america:0.03, an:0.02, and:0.32, anything:0.05, are:0.11, as:0.10, at:0.03, avengers:0.06, banner:0.08, battle:0.04, be:0.07, because:0.07, been:0.06, before:0.12, being:0.07, best:0.08, better:0.03, between:0.04, big:0.04, black:0.10, book:0.04, but:0.04, can:0.03, captain:0.03, care:0.05, cast:0.04, character:0.06, characters:0.07, comes:0.05, comic:0.03, could:0.03, did:0.03, didn:0.04, different:0.04, does:0.07, down:0.04, enough:0.04, especially:0.04, even:0.03, ever:0.03, every:0.04, expectations:0.05, fact:0.10, fans:0.04, feel:0.04, fight:0.04, film:0.07, first:0.03, for:0.07, from:0.05, fun:0.04, fury:0.11, get:0.03, going:0.04, half:0.05, has:0.08, have:0.04, haven:0.05, having:0.05, hawkeye:0.07, he:0.03, his:0.03, how:0.03, however:0.04, hulk:0.02, hype:0.05, if:0.05, in:0.13, interesting:0.05, into:0.03, iron:0.03, is:0.13, it:0.09, jackson:0.04, joss:0.06, just:0.07, keep:0.05, kind:0.05, know:0.11, let:0.05, like:0.07, little:0.04, ll:0.05, look:0.05, lot:0.07, love:0.04, make:0.03, makes:0.04, man:0.02, many:0.03, mark:0.03, marvel:0.03, me:0.09, more:0.08, most:0.06, movie:0.07, much:0.12, need:0.05, new:0.04, next:0.10, nick:0.04, no:0.12, not:0.04, now:0.07, of:0.15, one:0.02, or:0.05, original:0.06, over:0.04, parts:0.05, pretty:0.04, rather:0.05, re:0.18, really:0.03, reason:0.10, reviews:0.05, right:0.04, ruffalo:0.03, said:0.05, saw:0.05, scene:0.08, see:0.03, seem:0.06, seen:0.03, sequel:0.05, should:0.08, so:0.07, superheroes:0.04, take:0.04, than:0.09, that:0.07, the:0.30, their:0.06, them:0.12, then:0.04, there:0.10, they:0.15, this:0.10, thor:0.03, time:0.05, times:0.04, to:0.21, too:0.03, two:0.04, universe:0.14, us:0.09, very:0.03, want:0.04, watch:0.03, way:0.03, we:0.03, well:0.03, were:0.09, what:0.08, whedon:0.06, when:0.03, who:0.03, why:0.04, widow:0.07, will:0.06, with:0.06, without:0.08, would:0.03, year:0.05, years:0.04, york:0.05, you:0.24, your:0.16"
2014-12-11,"Firstly... For all the viewers complaining who aren't comic book fans, and don't like comics... What did you expect? It's a movie based off of some of the most popular comic characters in Marvel Universe. That's the point.Now, I'll admit, there's not a lot of surprise. Not a lot of twist, or plot. It's a character driven superhero film. Not about the great twist, or the psych thriller. That's not its purpose. It's not meant to be a movie to make you thing, or to shock, stun, surprise or terrify you.We enjoy comics for one reason: they're fun, and good characters. I mean, think for a second... Imagine X-Men without Wolverine, Gambit, and Rogue. Imagine reading about Hydra without Captain America. What makes comics great isn't just the story, or even mostly the story. It's the characters.The Avengers pulled together a great cast of people who lived and breathed their characters. Robert Downey, Jr. gets most props, but I didn't find any of the Avengers to be severely lacking. Even Scarlett Johansen as Black Widow pulled the part off fairly well.So yes. Plot? Simple; some might even say childishly so. Plot twists? Absolutely none. Worry about characters dying? Of course not, they're the good guys. An ending we couldn't see coming? Nope, everyone knew going in that the Avengers would win.But it was a good, simple movie, with great characters. And honestly... I enjoyed the change of pace. This was a movie anyone could watch. My 6 year old son loves it, my 45 year old father loves it, and even my 65 year old grandmother watched the entire thing with the family, and enjoyed it.So yeah, if you're looking for twists, plots that make your head hurt, something that makes a 'statement' or fights for a 'cause' you will be disappointed. But if you're looking for a good family film with great characters, a lot of laughs, some serious moments, and some really cool gadgets?

All the fighting and loud noises distract you that there isn't TOO much of a story going on other than ""team-up and save the world from an alien race we don't know much about."" This is where I think I have been spoiled by The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight set the bar for story-telling for superhero movies; it was deep and really touched a nerve. If you cut it, it would bleed. I also wanted Hawkeye, to play a bigger part!

2012-04-28,"Yes, its a superhero (super cast) marathon, insane CGI and production values at its best, blah, blah, blah. Everyone knows that, what people don't know is why Avengers will work for most and not for a few.i believe the real heroes of this movie are two guys Joss Wheton (Director/Writer/Screenplay Writer) Seamus McGarvey (Cinematographer) I have observed the movies which really work as an integrated unit are the ones where the director himself does the screenplay. As a film student myself i can safely say that no matter how hard you try if the director and screenplay writers have two different work spaces (unless they are people who get along on a very personal level) they would never get it rolling on film. That's why people like Christopher Nolan/Peter Jackson take their movies into outer space. OK, Enough crap. What's bad?The fact that its another superhero bang bang movie with the typical marvel unrealistic (non human) plots. The story moves in a predictable direction and the thrills were expected (only well presented). The fact that there's currently no Spiderman/Xmen in Marvel's 'Avengers' scheme of things will disappoint a few fans (Although Marvel Studios are onto Sony Columbia and Fox to get individual character rights for sequels). So surely a group of people will find it ordinary or not worth their time.What's good?You will run out of answers when you think of could this movie with this plot have been made any better at all? All the fan favorite marvel characters in the film are given as much character development and depth as a 142 min film could've allowed while at the same time make sure the visuals make it into the trailers and get audiences rolling in. The cinematography is fantastic for example there a couple of scenes where we (camera) are in the car and we see ourselves rolling! and the action scenes are done so that you can register/admire them properly (Michael Bay should have a look into this!). Joss Wheton is top class all through. Classic big screen adventure!For the majority of the fans. You will clap, cheer, hoot at Robert Downey Jr's quirks, Dr. Banner/Hulk's smash comedy and will admire Chris Evans commands as Captain America, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Chris Hemsworth as Thor. The visuals are fantastic, the plot is entertaining all through. 3D is an added feature which i personally enjoyed tremendously.

2012-04-27,"If you are a fan of any of the marvel characters in the movie, like myself, you will not be disappointed. You will exactly see what you have expected it to be in full length since the release of its trailer, no more, no less.Every superhero gets ample screen time and their interactions with one another is pleasantly entertaining.The surprise here is the Hulk, whom I think is far more fun to watch here than in his own movies. Accolades to Ruffalo, who did a great job with Banner. (I'm not sure if he can be as good as Ed Norton in a standalone but as part of an ensemble, he's perfect and I can't say the same with Ed Norton if he is to reprise his role here.) The CGI version of this Hulk is also way better than his previous versions - rightly proportioned, just the right tone of green and with an improved face that looks just like the comic version and even a bit like Ruffalo's. Simply awesome!My gripe(s) with the movie though is with its overly simple and uninteresting main plot. Tom Hiddleston is a charming lad but alas, Loki as the lone villain against such a powerful team is simply too weak and a non-threat. Throughout the movie, I never quite felt that anyone (except perhaps Loki himself) was in any kind of serious Jeopardy. Btw, speaking of weak enemies, how about an alien army (more like a skirmish team) on hover-boards? Hmm....looks familiar....don't they work for Skeletor? Perhaps that's what the whole portal thing was about. Together, it feels just like a plot-line pulled from an episode of ""He-man and the Masters of the Universe"". Also, if the alien mother-ship can be so easily destroyed, who needs the avengers? Just launch a few nuclear missiles at it as it comes through the portal, duh!Aside from that, there really isn't much else to complain, especially with the understanding that this movie serves as an introductory episode in the forming of the team more than anything. Walking out the theater, I wanted to see more, and agree with Joss Whedon when he said the sequel(s) will be smaller in scale. By that, I hope he means only the amount of CGI shots, not what is at stake or the magnitude of the catastrophe/adversary the avengers has to face, since the team bonding/friction seems to be the true strength of the franchise. (Leave a big chunk of exploding machines and collapsing skyscrapers to other movies please, since we have probably all seen enough of that by now.) Besides that, it also needs to be cleverer and more emotionally engaging.

2012-07-04,"The Avengers, by many people called 'the movie of the year', the epic combination of all the creatures and superheros who have had their own movies during the last decade. One thing is for sure: the film has visual effects. Quite a lot of them. And by 'a lot' i mean A LOT. In almost every scene there's some CGI, whether it's a gigantic Hulk or a flying Iron-Man. Two and a half hours of thrilling action, stunts, huge floating ships, creatures from another world, and more. So I think I speak for everyone who has seen this movie that visually this is one of the best movies ever made. It's a great movie to watch on the big screen in 3D, with a bag of popcorn on you side. The people who created the world of The Avengers have done an outstanding job, it's really overwhelming.But there's so many. So many fights, so many stunts, so many creatures. Al packed into one movie. If you erase all the effects and the action, there's nothing left. The dialog is lame and cheesy, the characters are flat and boring. The plot is simple and predictable, it doesn't leave you thinking and it's certainly not surprising and intuitive. I only cared about the characters because I knew them from previous movies, there's no real character development because the action is the most important aspect of the movie. Yes, the movie has it's funny and shocking moments, but really emotional or deep it never goes. It remains flat and focused on events and action until the (by the way, epic) conclusion.Everything considered, I would say that if you loved the previous superhero movies, and want to see how they come together, and love visual effects, you certainly don't want to skip this one. But don't except a masterpiece, smart dialog and deep emotional scenes.

2012-12-04,"I did not envy the mammoth task that Joss Whedon had in front of him. Some seriously good characters had been developed in some very impressive comic book films already, so he had to tread very carefully in order to not destroy what had been carefully created. He then had to bring them all together into one film and make sure that they 'all' had a purpose and that one did not outshine the other.So did it work? Well the answer is YES, beyond anything we could have expected too.Okay the plot is not original in anyway and it was fairly predictable but I wasn't going to see The Usual Suspects, after all what do comic characters do? They fight bad guys and save the world and that is exactly what we get. What really surprised me, is how some of the characters that only had minor roles in the previous films rose to the occasion and held their own, The Black Widow and Hawkeye really played their part which, before I had seen it, I was sceptical about. Captain America never really over impressed me in his own outing, he was good but that's it, in this he shone through becoming a vital leadership role, coordinating the Avengers throughout the end battle. Thor did his bit, probably the only character that didn't bring us anything special. Loki was outstanding, clever, funny and likable, something that Bruce Banner amusingly points out. Of coarse Iron Man steels the show, did we expect anything less from Downey Jnr, however a close match was The Hulk, who delivers some of the best moments in the film.The end battle is everything you expect it to be and if you are seeing it in 3D you are in for a real treat. The humour is absolutely spot on. What Whedon does best with all of the characters, no matter what world they are from, they are very human in nature which I think is the biggest key to the success of the Marvel comic book films, everyone has a sense of humour and through major life threatening situations they still keep it. Nobody is too serious.There are a few people that feel they have to go against the norm and put a film like this down, maybe they feel that by becoming a Simon Cowell and are very hard to please that makes them feel powerful and respected but the truth is that it is very sad that people behave like this. The bottom line is that all films are really supposed to be is entertainment, if you want to cry you go see The Green Mile, if you want to laugh you go see American Pie, if you want gore you see Hostel and if you want to see blockbuster action you go see Avengers Assemble.A film should be taken for what it is and if you go see this film for Oscar winning performances and clever plot twists then I'm afraid you will be extremely disappointed and quite frankly you should keep your opinions to yourselves. People are relying more and more on reviews to decide whether they should bother to go and see something and a good film reviewer should be flexible enough to see through the eyes of the audience it is aiming for.Ignore the bad reviews, if it's big scale action with vibrant characters and great humour you are after then you cannot miss this gem, the last time I was buzzing like this after a film was when I saw Jurassic Park on the big screen for the first time when I was 13 years old.

2012-04-27,"The Avengers or Marvel's Avengers Assemble here in the UK for ridiculous reasons is the long awaited teaming up of the characters from Marvel's recent and successful movies. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) returns to Earth and steals The Tesseract, an energy source being worked on by scientists at S.H.I.E.L.D. In response, S.H.I.E.L.D Director Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) activates the Avengers Initiative and assembles a team of superhuman men and women that comprises of Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Loki's brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) who join S.H.I.E.L.D Agents Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) in attempting to stop Loki from subjugating the world's population.There was always the danger that things could go 'tits up' for Marvel when producing a film on this scale and with so many well known characters and actors/personalities involved. I'm delighted to say that they have pulled it off and that The Avengers is a terrific film. The plot itself plays second fiddle to the assembling of the team and I don't think this was a bad thing. Obviously Marvel will be hoping for a sequel or five to come after the film so it was essential that the characters interactions and developments with each other were given high priority. The sharp dialogue is thrown between the characters with more force and precision than a throw of Thor's hammer. In the end the story is similar to every other superhero movie; bad guy brings destructive forces to Earth in an attempt to rule and/or destroy humanity while superhero(s) attempt to stop them. In Loki and Tom Hiddleston though, there is a bad guy who carries great menace and feels more dangerous when he is doing nothing than when he is thrashing his weapon around. I think that Hiddleston gives the best performance of the piece.The time given to each character seemed fair and worked well. There was a risk that this could have turned into Iron Man 3 plus Other Guys and as you'd expect given his character traits, Downey Jr does get more dialogue than the others but not so much that he overpowers the film. Captain America becomes the de-faco leader of The Avengers, Thor has a vested interest in bringing Loki to justice and while I'd like to have seen more of Dr. Banner, the Hulk had the best action scenes and also the biggest laugh of the entire film. Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and Sam Jackson also have plenty to do. It is testament to how good the film is that there are no characters who feel forgotten or underused.I've said in the past that I wish action blockbusters would be more fun. They always seem so straight and serious (i.e. Battleship), but The Avengers is the most fun film I've seen in a long time. The action was frenetic and thankfully avoided too much shaky-cam so I was able to keep up with it. It is also one of the funniest films I've seen for a few weeks. Marvel's films always have humour intrinsically wound into them but never before has there been so much and that it's hit the mark so often. I can't think of a big Hollywood movie that has made me laugh this much so far in 2012.As well as being action packed and fun, the movie also looks incredible. I saw it in 2D (and wont go on a rant as to why, but basically I'm sick of crummy, dark, 3D) and it still popped off the screen. Highlights included the fantastic and believable technology used aboard S.H.I.E.L.D's ship and most spectacularly of all, the giant Centipede like bad guys who looked phenomenal. The sight of them ripping through New York City is something that will stay with me. The main character's design and costume were all excellent. Iron Man looked even cooler when covered in dents and scratches and The Hulk's design is far improved from his Edward Norton days. For me the best costume though was Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow outfit because of.. um.. well.. the.. the colour's nice. Yes the colour.My only complaints are mild and that is that the horde of alien bad guys didn't really do much. It was only really numbers that they had on their side. Another small problem I had was trying to remember where everyone fitted as I've only seen each of the lead-up films once so couldn't quite place some people, words and ideas. Those though are extremely pernickety and minor problems.Overall The Avengers is one of the most entertaining films I've seen in years and at the end of the day we go to the cinema to be entertained so what more can I add? Only that this film has become greater than the sum of its parts.www.attheback.blogspot.com",9.0,2012-04,Friday,"2012:0.03, 3d:0.03, able:0.03, action:0.06, actors:0.03, after:0.02, alien:0.03, all:0.02, also:0.08, always:0.08, america:0.03, an:0.03, and:0.32, another:0.03, are:0.04, around:0.03, as:0.07, assemble:0.03, at:0.03, avengers:0.09, bad:0.12, banner:0.02, be:0.04, because:0.02, become:0.03, been:0.02, before:0.02, being:0.05, best:0.05, between:0.02, big:0.02, biggest:0.03, black:0.04, brings:0.03, brother:0.03, but:0.05, by:0.02, can:0.03, captain:0.04, character:0.06, characters:0.08, chris:0.05, cinema:0.03, come:0.02, could:0.04, couldn:0.03, dark:0.03, day:0.03, dialogue:0.06, didn:0.02, director:0.03, do:0.04, does:0.02, don:0.02, downey:0.04, each:0.06, earth:0.05, end:0.05, entertaining:0.03, entire:0.03, evans:0.03, even:0.02, every:0.02, everyone:0.03, excellent:0.03, expect:0.03, fantastic:0.03, far:0.05, feel:0.03, feels:0.03, few:0.03, film:0.12, films:0.09, for:0.06, from:0.05, fun:0.07, fury:0.02, get:0.02, given:0.09, go:0.07, good:0.02, great:0.02, guy:0.06, guys:0.10, had:0.06, has:0.07, have:0.07, hawkeye:0.02, he:0.05, hemsworth:0.03, here:0.02, hiddleston:0.08, high:0.03, his:0.05, hollywood:0.03, how:0.02, hulk:0.04, humour:0.03, in:0.14, incredible:0.03, into:0.04, iron:0.05, is:0.15, it:0.09, its:0.02, itself:0.03, jackson:0.05, jeremy:0.05, johansson:0.08, jr:0.04, keep:0.03, like:0.03, loki:0.09, long:0.05, looks:0.03, made:0.02, main:0.03, man:0.05, many:0.02, mark:0.04, marvel:0.08, me:0.05, more:0.10, most:0.06, movie:0.03, movies:0.02, much:0.09, my:0.02, never:0.02, new:0.02, nice:0.03, nick:0.02, no:0.02, norton:0.03, not:0.01, nothing:0.03, of:0.19, off:0.05, on:0.06, once:0.03, one:0.03, only:0.08, or:0.07, other:0.05, others:0.03, overall:0.03, packed:0.03, parts:0.03, past:0.03, people:0.02, performance:0.03, place:0.03, plot:0.02, quite:0.03, really:0.04, renner:0.05, robert:0.02, ruffalo:0.02, said:0.03, samuel:0.03, saw:0.03, say:0.02, scarlett:0.07, scenes:0.02, screen:0.02, second:0.03, seem:0.03, seemed:0.03, seen:0.11, sequel:0.03, serious:0.03, so:0.15, some:0.02, something:0.02, still:0.02, stop:0.06, story:0.02, superhero:0.04, team:0.05, tesseract:0.03, than:0.08, that:0.19, the:0.50, their:0.02, them:0.06, there:0.08, they:0.05, thing:0.03, things:0.03, think:0.06, this:0.05, thor:0.05, those:0.03, though:0.08, through:0.03, time:0.03, to:0.18, tom:0.05, too:0.02, up:0.07, used:0.03, ve:0.12, was:0.11, we:0.02, well:0.07, were:0.04, what:0.02, when:0.07, where:0.02, while:0.05, who:0.07, why:0.03, widow:0.04, will:0.04, with:0.06, world:0.02, would:0.02, years:0.03, yes:0.03, york:0.03, you:0.01"

2012-05-10,"I think this is the best super hero's movie ever created ever. What if someone breaks this record?? But it will never happen. Was this movie satisfied all super hero lovers?? Oh yeah. When the movie started I was thinking Iron man will get more applause than others. But Hulk got more response than Iron man. Especially climax scene, when Hulk came into the battle field in motorbike. Wow he came just like that. About the story, same old story saving the world from the Destroyers. But the screenplay and dialogs are very casual and especially humors are really good. Movie starts with Loki has joined with enemy of Asgard and planning to acquire the blue cube. Then what, he came to earth and got that cube from Nick Fury (Director of S.H.I.E.L.D). Then as usual Nick Fury wants that cube because it will destroy the earth. So he has to assemble the super heroes, because Loki has the alien's army. Rest of the story we all know. I told about the response from the theater for the Avengers movie. From the six super heroes (Iron man- Robert Downey Jr, HULK- Mark Ruffalo, CA- Chris Evans, Thor- Chirs Hemsworth, Black Widow- Scarlett Johansson, Hawkeye- Jeremy Renner, Loki- Tom Hiddleston and Nick Fury- Samuel L Jackson) initially Ironman got the number fans but the end of the film some of them were changed to HULK not me . I like Hulk too. Apart from the avengers I like Loki. He got a great style.I think all credits should goes to Stan Lee (Creator of the Avnegers) and Joss Whedon (for the making of the Avengers).

2012-05-09,"As a major Marvel comic book fan in my younger and more glamorous days, I am by no means exaggerating when i say i have been waiting for an Avengers film to be made for the last 15 or so years, at times the concept of having so many Superheroes contained in one film seemed an impossible challenge, but Joss Whedon (who also made Serenity, a fantastic sci-fi film if you haven't already seen it) has attempted the challenge and succeeded. With great results.Focusing on a plan by Loki (younger brother of Thor) to destroy the world, we see Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury finally put together his ''Avengers Initiative'' plan that has been referenced over the last few years throughout Marvel films (usually after the credits, forcing people like myself to sit in the cinema for 10 minutes after everyone has gone and look like a complete weirdo to Cinema Staff waiting to clean the screen). We thus see a crew of erratic and potentially volatile characters (Hulk, Iron Man, Black Widow, Thor, Captain America and ''Hawkeye'' doing his best Legolas impression) reluctantly join each other for this major operation and what ensues is both action and hilarity, and then more hilarity.Yes, whilst being an ''action'' film, Avengers contains more slapstick humour and one-liners than the majority of comedies made in the last decade, notably from Robert Downey JR as Tony Stark, who just seems like a naturally funny guy in real life. The action set-pieces are great and don't drag on for too long *cough Transformers cough*, whilst the flurry of different personalities at disposal in the film means that there is enough variation to make the 143mins zoom by. Personally, The Hulk stole the show for me, a surprise considering the last two films about his character were so poor.

2012-10-12,"I cannot believe The Avengers has received such stellar reviews. By 1/3 the way into the film, none of the characters draw one in, the story is uncompelling and I find myself only waiting in boredom for the next fight scenes which turn out to be formulaic and insufficient to warrant further viewing. The designs for various scenes and characters also fail. They look plastic and cheap and distracting from the story rather than immersive. Save your time and money and skip this title. Evidently these reviews have a minimum line count which is equivalent to paying by the word. So let me be verbose. This film was not even fun to watch the villains tearing apart the world because they look so silly in their costumes, their character building moments are horribly predictable and shallow, and what is up with the designs for Loki? He looks more samurai than Scandinavian god, which I am sure is a tip of the hat to the samurai influence in comic books, but let's get real for a moment. He's a bloody Norse god. He should look Norse. If he's going to look so radically different from Norse mythology -- all cybernetic-anime -- then there needs to be some kind of story and character building to explain it.",5.0,2012-10,Friday,"all:0.04, also:0.06, am:0.08, and:0.27, are:0.04, avengers:0.04, be:0.12, because:0.06, believe:0.09, but:0.03, by:0.10, character:0.11, characters:0.09, comic:0.06, different:0.08, even:0.06, fight:0.08, film:0.09, find:0.09, for:0.14, from:0.09, fun:0.07, get:0.06, god:0.17, going:0.07, has:0.05, have:0.04, he:0.21, if:0.05, in:0.12, into:0.06, is:0.12, it:0.03, kind:0.09, let:0.18, line:0.09, loki:0.05, look:0.34, looks:0.10, me:0.05, moment:0.09, moments:0.08, money:0.10, more:0.05, next:0.09, not:0.04, of:0.08, one:0.04, only:0.06, out:0.05, rather:0.10, real:0.09, reviews:0.20, save:0.09, scenes:0.12, should:0.07, so:0.13, some:0.05, story:0.16, such:0.08, sure:0.08, than:0.11, the:0.37, their:0.11, then:0.07, there:0.05, these:0.06, they:0.09, this:0.06, time:0.05, to:0.23, up:0.05, was:0.04, watch:0.06, way:0.06, what:0.05, which:0.17, with:0.04, world:0.07, your:0.07"
2012-05-17,"With each subtle hint at a future collaborative effort of various Marvel superheroes, it seems now that the entire world's anticipation was growing to an immense level. Now that The Avengers has shattered various box office records and is on pace to top the $1 billion worldwide gross mark, I'm sure anyone bothering to write up a review is doing so simply to state his or her case for how they enjoyed it, not so much to tell others what to expect.As far as that goes, I was incredibly impressed with The Avengers. My initial expectation of an action-packed, SFX-laced adrenaline rush were met with ease, and nothing less would have been satisfactory for any decent superhero picture. I also expected a movie with a hefty dose of comedic relief, mainly because of Robert Downey's lighthearted take on Iron Man in both of his solo pictures. This also turned out to be true, and added just what the film needed in between extremely heavy scenes of fast-paced, chaotic action.One of the strong dividing lines throughout recent years has been the casting choices for the various superheroes that have gotten both their own pictures and inclusion in the Avenger initiative. Going all the way back to the newer incarnations of the Hulk, fans were unable to come to any semblance of a conclusion on who would be best for what and why. ""Why Chris Evans as Captain America?"" is a commonly heard question, as is ""Why didn't Edward Norton come back as The Hulk?"". Unfortunately, you cannot please everyone with so many pivotal casting decisions, but I tend to feel that, overall, the characters portrayed in The Avengers are properly matched up to capable actors. Mark Ruffalo does an excellent job as the mild-mannered Bruce Banner, Jeremy Renner and Scarlet Johansson are easily up to their respective characters Hawkeye and Black Widow. The rest of the team has experience in their roles, from Downey's Iron Man and Evans' Captain America to Chris Hemsworth's Thor and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. But, when combined on screen, you cannot tell the ""rookies"" from the veterans.Simply put, The Avengers is the best Superhero movie you're likely to come across in terms of sheer entertainment. While I personally wouldn't rank it as my favorite (a reservation I still hold for Watchmen), it's without a doubt worth the price of admission and the incredible amount of hype it's received. An incredible feat of film production and merging talents, The Avengers is destined to be remembered as a high-water mark in superhero cinema.",9.0,2012-05,Thursday,"action:0.05, actors:0.05, all:0.02, also:0.07, america:0.06, amount:0.06, an:0.12, and:0.19, any:0.08, anyone:0.06, are:0.05, as:0.22, at:0.03, avenger:0.06, avengers:0.12, back:0.10, banner:0.05, be:0.08, because:0.04, been:0.07, best:0.07, between:0.05, black:0.04, both:0.11, bruce:0.05, but:0.04, captain:0.07, characters:0.06, chris:0.09, cinema:0.06, come:0.13, didn:0.05, does:0.04, downey:0.08, each:0.04, enjoyed:0.06, entertainment:0.06, entire:0.06, evans:0.10, everyone:0.05, excellent:0.06, expect:0.06, expected:0.06, experience:0.06, fans:0.05, far:0.05, favorite:0.06, feel:0.05, film:0.06, for:0.11, from:0.06, fury:0.04, goes:0.06, going:0.05, has:0.09, have:0.05, hawkeye:0.04, hemsworth:0.05, her:0.06, high:0.05, his:0.07, how:0.04, hulk:0.06, hype:0.06, in:0.14, incredible:0.10, iron:0.06, is:0.11, it:0.09, jackson:0.05, jeremy:0.05, job:0.05, johansson:0.05, just:0.03, less:0.06, lines:0.06, man:0.06, many:0.04, mark:0.12, marvel:0.03, movie:0.04, much:0.03, my:0.06, nick:0.05, norton:0.06, not:0.02, nothing:0.05, now:0.09, of:0.25, on:0.11, one:0.02, or:0.03, others:0.06, out:0.03, overall:0.05, own:0.05, packed:0.06, put:0.05, re:0.05, renner:0.05, rest:0.06, review:0.06, robert:0.04, ruffalo:0.04, samuel:0.05, scenes:0.04, screen:0.04, seems:0.06, simply:0.12, so:0.08, still:0.04, superhero:0.11, superheroes:0.08, sure:0.05, take:0.05, team:0.04, that:0.10, the:0.42, their:0.10, they:0.03, this:0.02, thor:0.03, throughout:0.06, to:0.29, top:0.05, true:0.06, up:0.10, was:0.05, way:0.04, were:0.07, what:0.09, when:0.03, while:0.05, who:0.03, why:0.14, widow:0.04, with:0.11, without:0.05, world:0.04, worth:0.05, would:0.07, years:0.05, you:0.08"
2012-05-02,"First thing first: ""The Avengers"" is a masterpiece. Period. It's not easy to put together the most famous Marvel superheroes (apart from Spidey, of course!)in a single movie with a good plot, very good characters development (good & evil), and make a great movie like this one. The story develops around the ""Avengers"" project, an idea by Nick Fury (director of S.H.I.E.L.D.) and the superhero-billionaire Tony Stark alias Iron Man. A group of Super-persons at service of mankind (something like the X-Men..). The villain here is Loki, returned from the end of the other great movie from Marvel Studios ""Thor"", eager to take control of the earth using the powers of the Tesseract, the same powerful alien artifact seen in ""Captain America"". There is a connection with other Marvel movies, in fact to really appreciate the movie you should see the other two movies at least, but it's not a priority of course. The result is a movie full of wonderful action sequences, smart dialogs, excellent character development and an open finale for another, possible, great adventure (don't worry, no spoilers here, just wait the end of the first part of the credits at the end of the movie..). A pleasant surprise, a wonderful movie for every comic fan around the world, and for the ones that hates this kind of movie: just see this film and you'll be amazed.

But as a guy frozen in a 60's time warp much like Austin Powers, I can simply say ""It's just not my thing, baby.""The movie is carried by the personality of Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark aka The Iron Man. This is no surprise. Downey is naturally funny and amazingly quirky while still being attractive. By contrast, Chris Evans comes off a bit like Chris Mintz-Plasse showing up at your fraternity rugby party.The best acting award goes to Powers Boothe. (He has done other notable work but I always harken way back to 1980 and The Guyana tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones). No one else in this film acted much in the real sense of the concept. They more or less played themselves.If you saw Thor (2011), Iron Man II (2010) or Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) you have pretty much already seen The Avengers.

2012-05-04,"This was an excellent superhero movie. I personally don't believe that the 'rumored' justice league movie of 2013, starring superman, batman, the flash, wonder woman and green lantern, will have an easy time living up to this film. The special effects were great and the 3d was very impressive. I think the hulk was an amazingly animated character and defiantly stole the show with his comedy, action and overall awesomeness. This film is defiantly worth the watch, especially in 3d.

Jackson,Gwyneth Paltrow 142 min - Action | Adventure | Sci-Fi | Superhero Suitable: PG-13VEpic movie!!!! I don't know from where to start...I mean this movie is the mother of all the entertainment which you can ever ask for! A movie which has produced what it was promised when it was under the production. 143 minutes of breathtaking experience and definitely a movie like this can be produced once in a life time. I don't know when was the last time I saw a movie in 3D but I am glad my experience of watching this movie will live for a long time. Lots of memories are now related to this movie! Excellent direction, I mean handling all these superheros, boy, that takes a great talent! However, in my personal opinion Hulk was the best then Iron Man! Special effects not to mention was top class..3D effects were also superb BUT try to watch without 3D!!! Excellent editing, great script and brilliant dialogues specially the punch lines.

2012-05-08,"The Avengers was a film with so much hype it was of course difficult to see it really living up to expectations. The film absolutely does and then some, wasting little time with exposition we meet all the characters fairly quickly making for an impressive feat in that the film ran at over two hours. If you have seen at least some of the films starring these characters you will be more than aware of them, but even if you haven't it is not difficult to pick up on the characters that have had their own films. In the case of The Hulk it really doesn't matter. So newcomers are welcome but some familiarity with Thor may be of preference although personally I didn't have it. In terms of the development it seemed as though there was an inevitability that some would get the upper hand. Namely Iron Man, Captain America and Thor with some coming for the Hulk. The likes of Black Widow and Hawkeye having less but still getting enough to get by, even if Black Widow's felt a little like it was produced in short bursts. Even early in the film I felt like Iron Man was stealing the show, this felt like a strength as egos can become rife in the characters if they are not written properly. Luckily we didn't have to endure poorly written blanket egos on screen. The Hulk was probably the character that stole the show throughout the entire film at least outside of the villain Loki. The Hulk was approached in a humorous manner devoid of complete seriousness from Eric Bana's and semi seriousness from Edward Norton's. The character is played in some way for comedic effect and once the Hulk is on screen he has the largest presence out of all of characters and Mark Ruffalo played it brilliantly knowing exactly what he was there for. Back to Loki, where he worked as a strong villain never quite making for a hammy comic book villain tailored for a family audience or the dark interpretation that has become typically associated with Christopher Nolan's Batman films. In terms of action it was excellent, earlier parts of the film were lacking light at all so it may be worth missing 3D. However the action later in the film worked brilliantly in 3D, especially for a post conversion. For some viewers it may bring back memories of Transformers: Dark of The Moon but at no point was it a cluster of images. The Avengers works as a film not requiring multiple things happening on screen and unlike the Transformers films the action always stayed exciting and left you wanting more. It also utilises humour in a brilliant way using it fairly frequently without reaching gag territory. All in all it is a very fun film and should you not like superhero films (because if you do you don't need me to tell you to see it)then you should just see it as it works as just a fun and sometimes epic summer blockbuster.",9.0,2012-05,Tuesday,"3d:0.08, absolutely:0.05, action:0.06, all:0.09, also:0.03, although:0.04, always:0.04, america:0.03, an:0.05, and:0.13, are:0.04, as:0.11, at:0.12, audience:0.04, avengers:0.04, back:0.08, batman:0.05, be:0.06, because:0.03, become:0.10, black:0.06, blockbuster:0.04, book:0.03, brilliant:0.05, bring:0.05, but:0.07, by:0.02, can:0.02, captain:0.03, character:0.05, characters:0.11, comic:0.03, coming:0.05, course:0.04, dark:0.08, development:0.04, didn:0.07, do:0.03, does:0.03, doesn:0.04, don:0.03, enough:0.04, entire:0.05, epic:0.04, especially:0.04, even:0.08, excellent:0.04, exciting:0.05, expectations:0.04, felt:0.13, film:0.19, films:0.15, for:0.13, from:0.04, fun:0.07, get:0.06, getting:0.05, had:0.03, has:0.05, have:0.08, haven:0.05, having:0.04, hawkeye:0.03, he:0.08, hours:0.05, however:0.04, hulk:0.11, humour:0.05, hype:0.05, if:0.12, impressive:0.05, in:0.20, iron:0.05, is:0.06, it:0.26, just:0.04, least:0.09, left:0.05, less:0.05, like:0.09, little:0.07, loki:0.05, making:0.08, man:0.05, mark:0.03, may:0.13, me:0.03, more:0.05, much:0.03, need:0.04, never:0.03, no:0.03, norton:0.05, not:0.08, of:0.22, on:0.08, once:0.04, or:0.02, out:0.02, over:0.03, own:0.04, parts:0.05, played:0.09, point:0.04, probably:0.04, quite:0.04, really:0.05, ruffalo:0.03, screen:0.10, see:0.07, seemed:0.05, seen:0.03, short:0.05, should:0.07, show:0.08, so:0.07, some:0.18, still:0.03, summer:0.05, superhero:0.03, than:0.03, that:0.08, the:0.41, their:0.03, them:0.03, then:0.07, there:0.05, these:0.03, they:0.02, things:0.04, this:0.01, thor:0.05, though:0.04, throughout:0.05, time:0.02, to:0.11, transformers:0.10, two:0.04, up:0.05, very:0.03, villain:0.11, was:0.18, way:0.06, we:0.06, were:0.03, what:0.02, where:0.03, widow:0.06, will:0.03, with:0.09, without:0.04, worth:0.04, would:0.03, written:0.10, you:0.18"
2012-06-04,this movie is a lot better than i expected. at first when i heard that they were making this movie i was quite exited as i love super hero sort of movies. i thought that this movie would probably be like other marvel movies where they had a load of talking at the start and then the action comes in a bit later. but unexpectedly this movie got on with the action straight away. i loved this movie it is truly one of this years must see films because it had breathtaking effects with a really funny side to it also.if i were to recommend this to anyone it would probably be every one who likes these sort of movies. with all the characters coming together to make one massive blockbuster seems like they did it. this would have to be one of the best films of the year and is a must see for any marvel hero fan.

2012-11-12,"The Phenomenal AvengersToday I watched ""The Avengers"" for the first time. The movie itself, I believe was very well put together. Not knowing who each character is and not seeing each one of their movies to get their background. The movie was well put together, that I understood what role each one played. With the original cast of each character are in this movie, except they did not use the original actor for the Hulk which is what I was familiar with but the part was very well portrayed by Mark Raffalo . The Hulk character keeps the viewers on edge, wondering what or when will he release the rage of The Hulk.The movie starts with that main villain Loky, god of mischief, planning one of his ultimate plans of taking over the world. The original actor, Tom Hiddleston, from the movie "" Thor"" plays an amazing part both dark and evil. Capturing all the characteristics of a grand villain, comes to life in the amazing film and Hiddleston plays the part to perfection. Other characters in this film include the fantastic performance of Chris Evans as Captain America. With his honor and loyal traits this character is incredibly brought to the screens with a perfect actor that does its great justice. All the characters in this film are portrayed wonderfully to bring this fantasy film to life. This movie also shows the truth of a community in a tragedy. When all hope is lost in the movie each character mad at each other in regular life come together to get through the hard times and defeat the powerful Loki. This is film each actor feeds each other in this film that all the scenes connect perfectly and even if you have not seen all the individual movies of all the characters one by one. The film is still pretty easy to follow and to catch up on each one and the part they play. All and all I would like to say that Joss Whedon did an amazing job on creating each character and I hope there is more to come.

Spanning the globe, a daring recruitment effort begins. -- (C) MarvelTHE AVENGERS is good, not great. The film does its job in entertaining the audience but not much more. It has some great action scenes, some truly funny moments, and some drama, but overall, it cannot be compared to the top superhero films, which includes THE INCREDIBLES, THE DARK KNIGHT, and SPIDER-MAN 2 for me. It's a popcorn flick, and if that's what you're expecting, then you'll be satisfied. As a Joss Whedon fan, I expected much more from the film than it just being entertaining.I felt the whole dysfunctional family aspect could have been executed better and expanded to be a more significant portion in the film. There was only one scene where the tension between the superheros can be felt, but that's about it. The film also could have used a bit more heart as I felt the whole team working aspect to be lacking in the emotion area. Additionally, the story seems to be overdone by now: Villain wants power and tries to take over the world. Maybe something different would have been more engaging.However, apart from those flaws, THE AVENGERS is a good film. The key success is due to the superheros themselves and how effectively Whedon manages to balance each of the characters without having one overshadow the other. Out of all of them, the Hulk, played by the talented Mark Ruffalo, is my favorite. He seriously has some of the most memorable moments in the film. Robert Downey Jr. is great as well. As of now, Downey pretty much nails his role as the egotistical yet charming Tony Stark. Black Widow, played by Scarlett Johansson, also gets some great moments in here which is good since she's the standout female character in the film. However, I felt they could have done more with Captain America and Thor. Additionally, although he's utilized better in this film than in THOR, I wanted a different villain than Loki.Overall, THE AVENGERS is a fun popcorn flick that starts the summer season but not with a big bang as I hoped for. The film could have used a bit more external conflict between the superheros, as well as more emotion.

2012-05-12,"This is is it. This is the movie fanboys have been hyping ever since we got a glimpse at Nick Fury at the end of Iron Man. The Avenger's is Marvel's very ambitious attempt to bring their A-listers(at least the ones they possess the rights to) all into one movie where they team up to fight evil. To accomplish this momentous task, Marvel brought in Joss Whedon(Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly, Serenity) to both co-write and direct this film of sky high expectations. Whedon, whom has proved himself to be excellent with ensemble casts, has not directed a theatrical film since 2005′s Serinity which may have left fans scratching their heads when he was announced. On top of the wildcard director, the film also has to bring in all of the stars from the past Marvel Cinematic Universe films into one movie without taking away from the other casts members. As cool as the epic team-up sounds on paper, is it really possible to bring all of these elements into one movie together under one vision?Read the rest: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-aG",10.0,2012-05,Saturday,"all:0.11, also:0.06, and:0.03, as:0.08, at:0.15, avenger:0.10, away:0.10, be:0.04, been:0.06, both:0.09, bring:0.31, brought:0.10, cinematic:0.10, cool:0.10, director:0.08, end:0.08, ensemble:0.11, epic:0.10, ever:0.07, evil:0.10, excellent:0.09, expectations:0.09, fans:0.08, fight:0.08, film:0.14, films:0.07, from:0.10, fury:0.07, got:0.09, has:0.15, have:0.08, he:0.05, high:0.09, in:0.07, into:0.19, iron:0.05, is:0.16, it:0.06, joss:0.06, least:0.09, left:0.11, man:0.05, marvel:0.15, may:0.09, me:0.06, movie:0.14, nick:0.08, not:0.04, of:0.15, on:0.09, one:0.17, other:0.06, past:0.11, read:0.11, really:0.05, rest:0.10, since:0.17, stars:0.11, team:0.14, the:0.36, their:0.11, these:0.07, they:0.10, this:0.13, to:0.24, together:0.06, top:0.09, universe:0.09, up:0.11, very:0.06, was:0.04, we:0.07, whedon:0.12, when:0.06, where:0.08, which:0.06, with:0.04, without:0.08"
2012-05-21,"I had expected more from Joss Whedan, but The Avengers (a.k.a Marvel's Avengers, a.k.a Marvel Avengers Assemble and various other permutations of this terrible title) is just another superhero movie: dull and hackneyed plot, poor characterisation, lots of fighting. It provides plenty for its pre-teen/early-teenage male target audience - great special effects, no romance and a very lengthy battle sequence at the end - but doesn't offer enough to adults to sustain interest for its 140-minute length. It is only saved from mediocrity by two factors: the humour in the script and Robert Downey's performance.

2012-05-09,"Very short counter review from a long-time movie-freak (not so much a superhero-freak, although I read a lot of comic books).The Avengers is completely overestimated in my mind. Why? It mostly reminded me Transformers 2 and Transformers 3 --- which were both god-awful movies. Very similar pointless action and destruction without any weight. If compared to Nolan's Batman -films, this is very cheap storytelling without gravity.Also: I almost slept watching The Avengers. There is no threat what so ever. The villains are plastic robots. Very boring. No tangible psychology behind it.There's no story. The flying ship is hugely boring. Most of the so called heroes are sissies in thighs (Thor, Loki, Arrow-Dude, Captain Boring etc) with exception of The Iron-Fellow who wears steel.Anything good? Not really. I give one star from male-perspective -- Scarpetta Johansson (as it's nice to call her) is surprisingly watchable when trapped in her chair. Cheap trick, but works. Also other male star --- Hulk is interesting those few seconds he got reasonable sequences.All in all. Two stars. There's only few seconds of interesting stuff to watch during this overlong 2,5h film. I try but fail to understand all the hype.

2015-04-27,"The Avengers is a great movie and I think it's because of what they wanted to do with this film in Phase One of Marvel's cinematic universe and this movie pays off quickly.The action is just amazing and the final fight at the end is just top-notch. You already know what the plot is about so I don't have to go over it, but I will say that the story was light hearted and dark at the same time and you had some humor. The ending fight was the longest fight scene ever shown in this film.Robert Downey Jr is great as Iron Man and he does get a lot of screen time. Chris Evans plays Captain America and he does an amazing job, Chris Hemsworth and Jeremy Renner were both good as Thor and Hawkeye and they have done a very interesting job with their characters. Mark Ruffalo was cool as Bruce Banner / The Hulk and he does motion capture for the Hulk and it was really great to see him as a superhero. Scarlett Johannson plays Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff and she could not done better in this film, but the one person who really was great is Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Thor's brother and he makes a good villain. James Spader is gonna do better as the title character, Ultron in the upcoming sequel in the 2015 Marvel Studios film, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"", which will be released this Friday on May 1st, 2015 and it is really cool to hear and see him as Ultron.Aaron Taylor-Johnson is going to rock as Quicksilver, but I think Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen's sister, Elizabeth, is hot as Scarlet Witch and she's gonna do great in that part, but Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury is good in the screen time he has in this film, but he only has a cameo or small part in the new Avengers movie, which I will review on Friday May 1st, 2015 and I think it's going to be a good film to start off the summer 2015 movie season.The visual effects are really impressive and really cool in this movie, especially The Hulk in this film. The music by Alan Silvestri is fantastic and amazing. I could not believe the music that I heard in this film and it was amazing to hear it. The film's running time feels like it's three hours long, but it is only 2 hours and 42 minutes long, so the movie moves on very quickly.Overall, I love THE AVENGERS and I am giving it an 8 / 10.

2012-04-27,"It was a spectacular experience watching this movie in 3D. Without the 3D effects it will only be a still those who love epic action movies. Movie starts off with a very slow pace and then it gathers speed since the entry of iron man.This movie has a large number of academy awards nominees. Robert Downey Jr; Gwyneth Paltrow; Samuel L Jackson; Jeremy Renner; Mark Ruffalo etc.It is Robert Downey Jr's movie indeed. He delivered a spectacular performance as a guy who can't help but to tell wits in each and every sentence he says. Th audience loved watching Iron man in action. I was happy with entry of Gwyneth Paltrow as well.Mark Ruffalo managed to stick to his own personal standard as well. He portrays a man who is very caring, soft and tender but later turns out to be someone who is disastrous to the environment, when he gets angry. Scarlett Johanssen shined well in this film. She was very flexible in action as well as acting. Her addition made this movie much more thrilling. She look very cool with curled red hair. It is definitely one of her best looks since Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Jeremy Renner and Chris Hemsworth too was good.Chris Evans looked a lot different from his earlier films. He managed deliver the maturity his character Captain America needed.The whole film had a lot of visual effects. The 3d effects mad the movie look more attractive. one can definitely go for the film to look for their favorite super hero.

2012-05-10,"The Avengers unite to save the day in Marvel's newest action adventure film ""The Avengers"". This superhero group is made up of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) puts all of these super humans together when Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor's brother, tries to take over Earth. Loki plans on achieving this goal by using the Tesseract, an energy-filled cube, which was discovered in the ocean in ""Captain America"", to bring alien invaders to Earth in order to destroy the planet. Loki even casts a spell on one of the Avengers, making him assist Loki in any way possible.All of the unique superheroes are supposed to work together, however many of their egos clash, leading to several disagreements that hinder their progress with the task at hand. It is especially difficult for Bruce Banner under these circumstances to keep calm and not transform into a giant, green monster.The special affects are quite impressive, but the main plot is non-creative. It was clever to incorporate Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, etc. into one movie, yet why would their job be to protect Manhattan from an alien invasion like in so many other contemporary movies? In addition, even thought the script has classic superhero clichés, it gets to be extremely cheesy. I found myself laughing at many of the foolish lines.My initial reaction to this film was not a good one. I actually couldn't wait to get out of the theater. I was so bored and unimpressed after hearing all the hype about this ""epic"" movie and being let down. After asking around, I've heard mixed reactions.

2012-05-06,"In the recent decade, Marvel studio's has triumphed over several competing movies with a wide variety heroes or anti-heroes all with different skill sets and abilities. But never has it been decided to make a film that unites the greatest Marvel characters of all time,...until now. It's an interesting concept because ideas this massive can either fail without recompense or it moves beyond the status quo. It's a high risk but with the right balance, things will pull through. As for this movie, the whole execution plays out well but there are still some things that could have been done differently.Starting off with one of the bad things is that this movie is a super- sequel. It's not like Marvel studios just decided to go with this idea from the blue. This whole movie was built up through the story telling of all the Marvel characters that are at the center of this story. The problem with this is that if a moviegoer is one who doesn't like skipping films and watching sequels out of order, this could be somewhat frustrating. Because then, the viewer will want to know how all the other characters came to be and not focus on what is currently happening in the movie.Back to the good, all the actors in this movie are phenomenal. Robert Downey Jr. still keeps his charm as the smart mouthed but yet intelligent billionaire Tony Stark. Chris Evans is still cool as Captain America. In some ways, he reminds of The Rocketeer (1991) because of his hairstyle and clothing that he wears. It screams out Cliff Secord every time Captain America was on screen. Mark Ruffalo was great as Bruce Banner. Even The Hulk was given some comedic parts in the film, which was great, because it shows he's not all brawn. Chris Hemsworth is also fun to watch, especially when he's whacking his hammer into everything. I will not say what every other actor does in this film because in the end, it can be seen that every one of them, superhero or non-super hero, gave it their all in this film and it shows. One thing I wished was added in this movie, character wise, were some other anti-hero Marvel characters such as Ghost Rider and The Punisher. I know they don't belong to The Avengers but it would still be fun to see them beating up the baddies too.As for the action, I'd say that there definitely was plenty of it and it wasn't overdone either which is good too. It truly is a sight to see how The Avengers coordinate their moves on how they take out the villains. And it's not like every scene was the same either. Every character had their own special moment to how they took out soldiers of Loki's army. The one that is the most fun to watch in my opinion is The Hulk just because it is a situation like this where Banner can run amok and tear apart anything he wants at any time. The musical soundtrack was composed by Alan Silvestri, which does not surprise me at all. Silvestri is good at this kind of material and there's nothing else that's needed to be said.The only other flaw I have to confront with this movie is that the whole concept of allowing an alien race to come and take over the Earth through a time portal, is almost an exact replica to Michael Bay's Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011). Even the flying behemoth gunships that come out of the time portal resemble the Decepticon gunships too closely. Seriously, who hasn't seen this whole plot device before? But what makes this worth seeing is that the heroes in this film are not running from their enemies (cough cough* Sam Witwicky), and screaming like a woos. Again though, these flaws are so minor, no one will really care or probably even make the connection. There really isn't much to not like about this film.Even though it bares a small resemblance to other major blockbuster films, The Avengers will hold its own as one heck of a comic book ensemble.

2012-06-04,"I didn't think this movie would live up to the expectations that surrounded it. But luckily it did. whoever hasn't seen this movie yet, what the heck are you waiting for!? This is a great movie for comic book fans, kids, and anyone who loves some good ol action. I really didn't think this movie would've'e been as good as it was without Iron Man, Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America. So I loved everything about this movie:Acting, action, plot, special effects. The only problem I personally had was just that hulk wasn't in it as much as I wanted. But when he was there it was just epic. Also that the hulk really reminded me of a a gorilla at the end of the movie which i found just funny. But other than that I can ignore the fact that Odin just sent Thor to earth, the Chintari just dying after the mother ship blew up, and the excessive comedic relief.

2012-04-29,"Till now, The Avengers is the most spectacular motion picture of 2012. I doubt that there is any other film can beat that. The soundtrack is beautiful. The acting is well-done. The directing oh my, is marvelous! I know Joss Whedon is good at doing ""teamwork"" films like Firefly, Serenity, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, etc. but I was stunned when seeing The Avengers.Damn, he's that good! Containing a group of superheroes in one live action feature film is an amazing idea, but make it work is a whole different thing. And Joss Whedon just did that radiantly. I am also keeping an eye on Zak Penn, who wrote the script of The Avengers. He had done an excellent job there.Well, I do realize that most of reviews on IMDb have already talked about how wonderful this movie is. And I admit that I am not as good as other viewers at this point. So I just talk about one thing really got me in this movie. Above all those magnificent details about the soundtrack, the script, the visual experience, etc. one thing is very small and even not in the league of those really got me: Tony Stark went for it.What did he go for? I won't tell you, see it yourself. What Tony did in The Avengers had brought back the Stark I knew in Iron Man (2008). And for me, Tony Stark is the most admirable character in this film. Well firstly, I like Loki. I still like him, just love Tony more. Can't wait to see him in Iron Man 3, which directed by Shane Black (he did Kiss Kiss Bang Bang).Long story short, ladies and gentlemen, go watch The Avengers. It's worth your time. People start to compare this film with The Dark Knight Rises. Come on, guys. Don't ruin the moment. Not everything needs to be compared. The Avengers is wonderful motion picture, so does The Dark Knight Rises may be. That's it.

2013-04-07,"This movie is meant for those 8 and up. It is also meant for those who like SciFi Fantasy. The Avengers, a group of single comic book heroes, get together to save the world from Lokki. Samuel Jackson, the head of the Earth's protective forces, plays his role well. The characters are shallow, but let's face it, it's comic book time. It is fast paced and contains interesting toys and gadgets. It works as a great party movie. I loved the sets, the colors, and the characters, all in one film. Thor even comes to the rescue.

2012-05-08,"I know there were some concerns out there regarding the former creator of Buffy and Angel doing the screenplay and directing, and there were also a few eyebrows raised when Disney took over the Marvel brand. But everyone can relax, because this flag is up the pole, and everyone is saluting.Robert Downey Jr. is especially his arrogant self as Tony Stark, and I loved the scenes where he and Gwyneth Paltrow are acting like a couple. His interactions with Chris Evans and Mark Ruffalo set the stage for the internal conflicts with each other and Samuel L. Jackson. The dynamics of the characters could not have been any better.And speaking of the newest member of the Marvel character crew, hats off to Mark Ruffalo who took a role once played, poorly, by Eric Bana, and somewhat better by Ed Norton, and not only made it his own, but made Bruce Banner come to life in realistic ways. His persona as the more aggressive scientist with self control and determination lends to the idea such a being might be controlled, or at least directed.Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston play beautifully off one another, which gives us the impression of the Asgardian egos and the depths to which they extend. Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner are perfect as the bodyguards née assassins who are as courageous as they are talented. And Clark Gregg reprises his role from Iron Man and Thor to remind us there are always dedicated men who are simply trying to do their job, in spite of extraordinary circumstances.The story is fast paced, and wastes little time in exposition, with smidgens of personal lives and assignments interspersed in the film. Overall, the cinematography is exceptional, the graphics are phenomenal, and the entire film has the flow and character of the Comic Books (okay, Graphic Novels) of our misspent youth. I went in expecting an epic, and was not disappointed. Rated PG-13 for violence and a mild reference to drugs, anyone who ever read the stories and those of us who love the prequels (let's face it, folks, Iron Man, Thor, etc. were all prequels to this event) will love this film.

We all thoroughly enjoyed the film. The film does get off to a good start and then it does slow down a bit to construct the plot and the character interaction to make it all work. But, when that is done, the film becomes a roller coater ride of special effects and action that is a treat to watch. Good Humor, Good Plot Build, Good Character Development, and Just Plain Well Done.

2019-11-25,"It reminds me of Van Helsing, but better.The tesseract, the blue box MacGuffin from Captain America has awoken and called out to the cosmos. SHIELD, the organization tasked with protecting Earth and is experimenting with the tesseract, begins an evacuation as the little box becomes more active. Arrives Loki, slightly grungier and less interesting than we last saw him in Thor, is there to conquer. Telling Earthlings that we were made to be ruled and that freedom is a lie. It saddened me to see Loki, the made driven by a surprisingly complex combination of jealousy, anger, and ambition in his previous appearance relegated to generic bad guy, but oh well. The point of this movie isn't the conflict between antagonist and protagonist. The point is to get a bunch of protagonists together, struggle to work as a team, and then decide to work together as a team against a bigger threat.That team is, of course, all of the heroes we've met over the last few movies. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and the Hulk are joined by some smaller players like Black Widow and Hawkeye. The movie begins in a place where almost none of them have any previous relationship to each other, and the most fun from the film is the different heroes figuring out who the others are. Most have heard of Captain America, but he's still finding his feet and has an impression of Iron Man that's pretty accurate if a bit incomplete (impulsive and reckless without noting the heart of gold). Thor shows up and knows no one, only there to grab Loki, so the two Earthlings Iron Man and Captain America have a mutual beat down with Thor over who gets ownership of the captured Loki, drawing a stalemate. Hulk is brought along in his Bruce Banner disguise to help track the tesseract because it has a gamma signature and Banner is the best at tracking gamma rays.Loki does his best Joker impression and intentionally gets captured so he can try to implode the team arraying against him from the inside. He knows of Hulk (supposedly because he started the movie by infiltrating SHIELD and gaining a few insiders through magical mind powers) and wants him to become the big green rage monster and cause destruction. It's not the worst plan in the world, but it's not great either. What it actually is is an excuse to get all of the Marvel heroes into a room and on one side of a larger conflict.What helps the movie most is its balance of tone. It never gets too serious, keeping things light with quippy dialogue, conflicts between the heroes that never really turn too sour, and a death that's used for its dramatic purpose before being forgotten quickly enough to not color the rest of the film.The action of the film is brightly lit and cleanly filmed. The fight between Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor in the forest at night (as Loki sits and watches) moves around dynamically but never becomes confusing. We understand geography easily and the introduction of Captain America later in the fight is handled with ease. The real bright spot in the film, action-wise, is the battle in New York.With six heroes, one main antagonist, and a disposable CGI army, the film keeps the separate lines of action incredibly clear. Distinctly different locations (from a street to the top of Stark Tower to the top of another, clearly different, building to flying through the air), the film is able to make the visuals immediately communicate where the action is happening and who is involved, creating a marvelous sense of geography in such a large place of chaos. There is a long take late in the fight that passes from one hero to the next, and the amazing thing isn't the special effects, but the fact that it's more of an underline of who is where and not a clarifying moment. The conflict ends with the annoying ""We're all done now, bye!"" chestnut.Ultimately, though, while the experience is fun, I think the less interesting version of Loki as antagonist combined with the fact that the movie seems to have nothing to say beyond the facile idea of ""good guys need to work together"" keeps it from being anything more than an entertaining rollercoaster. Of course, the real goal was to entertain, and I think it does largely succeed.",7.0,2019-11,Monday,"able:0.03, action:0.06, actually:0.03, against:0.06, all:0.04, almost:0.03, along:0.03, amazing:0.02, america:0.11, an:0.08, and:0.28, another:0.03, any:0.02, anything:0.03, are:0.03, army:0.03, around:0.03, as:0.07, at:0.03, bad:0.03, banner:0.05, battle:0.03, be:0.01, because:0.04, become:0.03, before:0.03, being:0.05, best:0.04, better:0.02, between:0.08, big:0.02, bit:0.03, black:0.02, brought:0.03, bruce:0.03, but:0.07, by:0.05, can:0.02, captain:0.11, cgi:0.03, course:0.06, dialogue:0.03, different:0.09, does:0.05, done:0.03, down:0.03, each:0.02, earth:0.03, effects:0.02, enough:0.03, entertaining:0.03, experience:0.03, fact:0.06, few:0.05, fight:0.08, film:0.09, for:0.01, from:0.09, fun:0.05, get:0.04, gets:0.09, good:0.02, great:0.02, guy:0.03, guys:0.03, has:0.05, have:0.05, hawkeye:0.02, he:0.07, help:0.04, hero:0.02, heroes:0.10, him:0.07, his:0.07, hulk:0.05, idea:0.03, if:0.02, in:0.12, interesting:0.06, into:0.02, iron:0.07, is:0.20, isn:0.06, it:0.10, its:0.04, last:0.05, less:0.07, like:0.02, lines:0.03, little:0.03, loki:0.13, long:0.03, made:0.04, main:0.03, make:0.02, man:0.06, marvel:0.02, me:0.04, mind:0.03, moment:0.03, more:0.05, most:0.06, movie:0.06, movies:0.02, need:0.03, never:0.07, new:0.03, next:0.03, no:0.02, not:0.05, nothing:0.03, now:0.02, of:0.27, on:0.01, one:0.05, only:0.02, other:0.02, others:0.03, out:0.03, over:0.05, place:0.07, point:0.06, powers:0.03, pretty:0.03, previous:0.06, re:0.03, real:0.06, really:0.02, rest:0.03, saw:0.03, say:0.02, see:0.02, seems:0.03, sense:0.03, serious:0.04, so:0.03, some:0.02, special:0.02, stark:0.03, still:0.02, such:0.03, take:0.03, team:0.09, tesseract:0.10, than:0.04, that:0.10, the:0.58, them:0.02, then:0.02, there:0.05, thing:0.03, things:0.03, think:0.04, this:0.01, thor:0.08, though:0.03, through:0.06, to:0.23, together:0.06, too:0.04, top:0.06, two:0.03, understand:0.03, up:0.02, used:0.03, ve:0.02, wants:0.04, was:0.01, we:0.11, well:0.02, were:0.02, what:0.03, where:0.07, while:0.03, who:0.08, widow:0.02, with:0.10, without:0.03, work:0.08, world:0.02, york:0.03"

2012-08-21,"Of all the recent Marvel movies which led to this film, I thought Thor was pretty decent, and the rest were blah. ""Avengers"" is arguably the worst yet.The film reminded me of Transformers 3, with constant explosions and destroyed buildings, as well as ubiquitous 3D scenes which actually don't look very realistic. This movie is a gimmick.The plot is utterly cliché and haphazard. The dialogue, save for a few funny lines, is very bad.

2012-05-08,"Marvel Studios has finally brought the whole team together, after years of hinting at the Avengers initiative coming to fruition to fight united against evil, they have done it. The Avengers was not only a reunion of Marvel's best loved superheroes, but it is a fun and funny, action-packed blockbuster movie to kick off the Summer movie season as it opened to an astounding $207.4 million, the single biggest grossing domestic film opening weekend of all time. It topped Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 by more than $38 million, the previous record holder. Why has this film done so well? Everyone loves it! The critics love it (93% Rotten Tomatoes rating) and Marvel fans love it and the average moviegoer has loved it. The film is almost completely devoid of romance and sex which hurts some of the draw of female audiences, but its non-stop action, fast-paced storyline and awesome special effects keeps viewers engaged. The odd joke thrown in here and there is a brilliant touch that does irritate, but instead adds to the experience.

2013-06-26,"Now, the problem with a film such as The Avengers aka Avengers Assemble aka Marvel's Spectacular Avengers Spectacle! is that it can only be compared to its predecessors and can not be a pure fresh story. It does indeed, have cracks in its foundations, with the decent Iron Man and Captain America and mediocre Iron Man 2 and Thor. But The Avengers is as great as it could be. The main factors that makes it stand above those rushed charmless creations is its genuine heart pumped in by Joss Whedon.It has a genuine tension, something that was dramatically lacking in the other films based on the mere concept that they were setup films for this blockbuster, therefore the protagonists nor throwaway side characters simply could not be in any meaningful peril, despite that being what the action films were about. In The Avengers, the characters (or egos) can barely stand to be in the same room with each other for too long without the chemistry exploding. As it has multi- protagonist stories, it opens the opportunity for there to be a real chance of one of the characters being in mortal danger without being contrived, and that is pretty much expected from Whedon's trademarks.The heart of the film lies mostly in Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, as it develops Stark as a human being in very brief sequences, though of course his classic punchlines are a particular highlight, but The Avengers paints the Hulk as the secret ultimate weapon, which is a difficult task as the terrible Hulk (2003) and equally awful The Incredible Hulk (2008) struggled to portray the scale of his power. He certainly steals the scenes that Stark doesn't. I saw in in 3D so it was a particularly intimate experience - there are some amazing goose-bump worthy shots of the superheroes all together - but it made it sometimes confusing as the effect doesn't work well with closeups of action, especially as it distracted from the science jargon thrown around by Stark and Banner, rendering some of the scenes hard to follow, but it didn't matter in the end.It's still astounding in how Whedon crammed everything in, despite the 142 minute running time, of which it had a comparable pace to The Dark Knight in the scale of the sequences. It was incredibly satisfying and creative by the end. However, the series may struggle as they don't have the benefit of having equally famous villains as Batman and Spiderman have. I don't think I have the patience to watch the sequels to the rest of the Avenger films just to keep up with the characters, but it really does depend on the writer and director, as I didn't like Thor and Loki in their own films but enjoyed their relationship here. Nevertheless, The Avengers is the perfect summer blockbuster; intelligent, witty and action-packed. And I wanna see it again already.Update: I did. And it lost most of the shine that charmed me.

2012-09-15,"The film opens with a spectacular action sequence and you almost understand that the movie will be in epic scale that disappoints or does not, that's another story. Let's talk about the team members first! I know that I am in the minority and sorry, but my favorite Bruce Banner was Eric Bana, it is and it will be, not Edward Norton. In fact, as an actor, I like Edward Norton much more than Eric Bana, but as a character, Bruce Banner, I think that Norton didn't fit the character at all. I mean that it was like I was watching Edward Norton, not Bruce Banner, it was not convincing for me. As for Mark Ruffalo, he was believable as Banner, so better than Norton, but worse than Bana. My only personal problem with Hulk was I couldn't like this ""bad-ass"" Hulk. I know that many of you will surprise when you read that, but I really tried, but I couldn't. It is not important, but also I would prefer my giant to be bigger and taller. Black Widow is, one sentence, she is so hot! Period. Captain America was better in his own movie. He is ""cold"" here. I don't know he was unlikeable in this movie. As action, I can't say that his parts were bad, but it was disappointing. My favorite scene in the whole The First Avenger movie was the shield fight and in this one, there is not any scene in the same level (for Captain America) And I didn't like this new costume either. The conversation between him and the agent in the plane was realistic? or poorly written? You decide. Hawkeye is cool, but before this movie, honestly I didn't know about that character, may be because of that I didn't feel any kind of excitement towards the character. I just ""watched"" him. The Iron Man is The Iron Man you know, so Thor is, but there was a minor problem about Iron Man, he was too powerful in this movie, but really too powerful! Despite the parts take place in the helicarrier feels like Star Trek a little bit, it was great, great action! The main villain of the movie, Loki has some problems as a character. It reminded me Magneto, especially when he ""finds himself"" in a cocktail. It was a pointless scene if you ask me and as a villain, yes he is ""paper-tiger"". He can't be a dominating villain not because of the actor, because of the script. As for one for one fights, Whedon delivers, he doesn't disappoint! Iron Man vs. Thor fight was breathtaking, Hulk vs. Thor fight was great too. Dreams came true... However, ""the battle of words"" between Iron Man and Captain America was insulting for me, it was far fetched. In general the team work works. The very long final climax made the film, despite at times, it reminds you Transformers as many people realized. Yes, the cube, the machines, all these recalls Transformers, but there is the dream team, different type of action, a lot of creative ideas, better direction, better action, you just forget it or you just don't care about it. Some people ask where is the military? Well, I have two answers for that which relieve you I hope: if the military had engaged the enemy, the movie would have been just the copy of Transformers movies and the movie would have been cliché and boring. There were not S.W.A.T. also, that would make the movie cliché and boring too if you ask me. Only The Avengers and the enemy, think like that. As said before, I enjoyed, but didn't like Hulk in this movie. As I seen, most of the audiences loved the ""the punch"" and ""the slamming"" moments, even some people said these were the best moments of the whole film! Sorry, but I disagree. It was just too funny for my taste. I mean those moments ruined the tone of the film for me. Also that fight could have been a serious one, but no problem. It is like I liked this bad-ass Hulk, but also I didn't like. Another thing I disliked about Hulk was he was moving like a monkey at times and that annoyed me.

2017-04-01,"I'm not a traditional comic turned into movie watcher. I do have a tendency to watch those films that seem to catch my attention in the trailers, are recommended by friends, like the Avengers, or have high ratings. Not being a super-hero comic film devotee, for a super-hero movie to work for me has to be basically entertaining, engaging and fun. And, if possible to have a good combination of at least a few of the following elements: > Good script. > Great action scenes. > Fantastic production. > Good actors. > Good acting. > Great sense of humor. > A great music score. This movie ticked off a good deal of this boxes, and that happened mostly in the final hour of the film. THE GOOD. > The production of the Avengers is top notch. Great settings, suits, spaceship design, and alien images. > The last half of the movie is what I expect from a super-hero action movie to be and it has a great tempo, awesome action scenes, spectacular fights and alien creatures, and is full-on fun and engaging. > Jackson, Hiddlestone and Evans are good in their performances, but I personally liked the freshness and natural acting of Paltrow and Gregg in their very secondary supporting roles. I love seeing kick-ass female characters, and Johannson seems really fit for that sort of roles, and she nails her character in that super-tight suit. > Some of the dialogues and scenes were witty. THE BAD. > Painful tempo and too long. I felt bored to the core during the first half of the movie, which goes for over an hour, with boring pretentious dialogues not much happening, and scenes that don't add anything to the film. I stopped the DVD frequently because I was struggling to keep my attention focused. > Hemsworth was a pain to watch when he had to deliver his lines no matter how hot, and Downey Jr always plays the same role no matter his character, something I find very annoying. > Thor had a quite heavy Australian accent but his brother in the film Loki had a very British accent, although, of course, they are from planet whatever. Shouldn't they have had at least a neutral unified accent? > The film is set in a sort of near future, with flying ships and very developed technology, but we see the Police and some of the characters using simple shotguns; this incongruity rests credibility to the settings of the film.THE LOL. The only thing I found hilarious in the film is Ruffalo's transformation into Hulk and some of the scenes related to the Hulk. Seeing the Hulk with Ruffalo's face was like seeing Hulk with Micky Mouse's face. Ruffalo has very sweet facial features, seems to be a very sweet guy, and usually plays tranquil man roles. This was a fluffy huggable Hulk. I was really LOL. The dialogue between him and the old man when he falls into a warehouse are hilarious, but that was intended. OVERALL. If you are fan of Super-hero comic books and films, you are going to enjoy and love this film no matter what I say; that's great and totally respectable. If you are a lover of good films, no matter the subject, this film is entertaining overall, has a great second half, but you will struggle to get there without feeling uninterested due to the unfocused direction, the poor dialogues and the extra-long unnecessary footage.If you overcome the first half, congratulations, you have made it to the Avengers' red carpet of action galore.",6.0,2017-04,Saturday,"acting:0.06, action:0.07, actors:0.03, alien:0.08, although:0.04, always:0.04, an:0.02, and:0.31, anything:0.04, are:0.13, at:0.04, avengers:0.05, awesome:0.03, bad:0.03, be:0.06, because:0.03, being:0.03, between:0.03, boring:0.04, brother:0.04, but:0.08, by:0.02, character:0.05, characters:0.04, comic:0.08, course:0.04, dialogue:0.04, do:0.03, don:0.03, downey:0.03, enjoy:0.04, entertaining:0.07, evans:0.03, expect:0.04, face:0.09, fan:0.03, fantastic:0.04, felt:0.04, few:0.03, film:0.17, films:0.08, final:0.04, find:0.04, first:0.05, for:0.06, found:0.04, from:0.04, full:0.04, fun:0.06, get:0.03, goes:0.04, going:0.03, good:0.16, great:0.15, guy:0.04, had:0.10, half:0.16, has:0.09, have:0.09, he:0.05, hemsworth:0.03, her:0.04, hero:0.13, high:0.04, him:0.03, his:0.07, hour:0.09, how:0.03, hulk:0.10, humor:0.03, if:0.09, in:0.11, into:0.08, is:0.08, it:0.03, jackson:0.03, jr:0.03, keep:0.04, last:0.04, least:0.08, like:0.04, liked:0.04, lines:0.04, loki:0.02, long:0.07, love:0.07, made:0.03, man:0.04, me:0.02, movie:0.09, much:0.02, my:0.04, no:0.10, not:0.05, of:0.24, off:0.03, old:0.04, on:0.02, only:0.03, or:0.02, over:0.03, overall:0.07, performances:0.04, quite:0.04, really:0.05, role:0.04, ruffalo:0.08, same:0.03, say:0.03, scenes:0.14, script:0.04, second:0.04, see:0.02, seeing:0.11, seem:0.05, seems:0.08, sense:0.04, set:0.04, she:0.04, simple:0.04, some:0.07, something:0.03, spectacular:0.05, super:0.15, that:0.10, the:0.46, their:0.05, there:0.02, they:0.04, thing:0.03, this:0.08, thor:0.02, those:0.03, to:0.23, too:0.03, top:0.04, very:0.15, was:0.10, watch:0.05, we:0.03, were:0.02, what:0.04, when:0.05, which:0.03, will:0.02, with:0.06, without:0.03, witty:0.04, work:0.03, you:0.11"
2012-05-08,I gotta say when I went to the cinema I had high expectations. But this movie went over my expectations. It has a good storyline and I like the idea of putting many known heroes in the same movie. Actually I wonder why no one has done that before in a Hollywood movie recently. It was fun to watch these brilliant characters come together and fight together.One of the good things about this movie is that it has the humor from Iron man which is excellent. Even though this movie is an action movie with a lot of explosions it has scenes where everyone in the cinema laughed so much you couldn't hear the movie anymore. The action part is also great. It hasn't got too much special effects and every single on of them is accurate. In fact all of the computer work is brilliant. The acting is very good too. All the actors get their characters so well. Robert is so great at acting Tony Stark you could think he isn't acting.I didn't see any fails or wanted something different and I had a real blast while watching so it deserves nothing less than a 10/10.,10.0,2012-05,Tuesday,"10:0.14, about:0.05, acting:0.21, action:0.08, actors:0.07, actually:0.08, all:0.07, also:0.06, an:0.05, and:0.11, any:0.06, at:0.05, before:0.07, brilliant:0.19, but:0.03, characters:0.09, cinema:0.18, come:0.07, could:0.06, couldn:0.10, didn:0.07, different:0.08, done:0.07, effects:0.06, even:0.05, every:0.06, everyone:0.07, excellent:0.09, expectations:0.17, fact:0.09, fight:0.08, from:0.04, fun:0.07, get:0.06, good:0.14, got:0.08, great:0.09, had:0.11, has:0.19, he:0.05, heroes:0.06, high:0.08, hollywood:0.10, humor:0.08, idea:0.10, in:0.12, iron:0.05, is:0.23, isn:0.08, it:0.17, less:0.09, like:0.04, lot:0.07, man:0.05, many:0.06, movie:0.22, much:0.11, my:0.05, no:0.06, nothing:0.08, of:0.14, on:0.04, one:0.08, or:0.05, over:0.06, part:0.08, real:0.08, robert:0.06, same:0.08, say:0.06, scenes:0.06, see:0.05, single:0.10, so:0.18, something:0.07, special:0.07, stark:0.07, storyline:0.10, than:0.05, that:0.06, the:0.28, their:0.05, them:0.05, these:0.06, things:0.08, think:0.06, this:0.09, though:0.08, to:0.06, together:0.11, tony:0.08, too:0.12, very:0.05, was:0.04, watch:0.05, watching:0.07, well:0.05, went:0.19, when:0.05, where:0.07, which:0.06, while:0.08, why:0.07, with:0.03, work:0.07, you:0.08"
2023-09-13,"Iron Man should be constantly bullying Captain America. It makes no sense that he doesn't. Iron Man briefly mentions that Cap's powers ""came out of a bottle."" Of his dad's. That's all. It would make perfect sense, if Iron Man distracted, ignored and patronised Cap at all times, especially during emergencies. Iron Man per movies 1 and 2 submits to all athorities he ever meets (except baddies, but they aren't authorities). If he doesn't bully, he'll start sleeping bad. Not bullying isn't normal from Iron Man's perspective: Cap is someone everyone wants to be best buddies with. But not a superhero like Iron Man or Thor. That should worry Iron Man in particular. Besides, Iron Man needs no buddies, he is behind armor 90% of the time. On top, he is a self-confessed non-moralist. As a result, Cap should be Iron Man's bullying victim 2 seconds after they meet, and this would never end, as long as Fury puts them in the same team.

2012-05-03,"By geeks, about geeks, for geeks. Tempting the geek dollar out of its den into the local multiplex with a thrill that can't be bought on the Xbox.Is it The West Wing in space? Or is it Stargate meets X-Men? There is not a shred of originality or true imagination in this noisy, flashy, ugly commercial behemoth. It is part of an action figure marketing campaign; a film made by men who still think like pre-teenagers, who were inspired long ago by comic books cheaply churned out by groups of at most six people - who at least had a grasp of characterization.The now-grown comic-book readers have to remain in their adolescent playrooms and pay homage to that excitement because they dare not go out into the world and feel real suspense, fear, or loss. They must burn gazillions of dollars and employ thousands of people in trying to recreate that comic-book buzz. A long-lost childish thrill is the only feeling they are willing to let themselves - or you - experience.Will you join them? Will you sit in a darkened room pretending that you are engaging with life because you have a 3D screen, surroundsound, and a broadband connection? Will it be enough for you to escape into Joss Whedon's stunted teenage netherworld, or will you go outside and attempt to engage with - god forbid - strangers, rather than aliens, superheroes and vampires?There are movies, even trashy ones, that will echo, embellish and enhance your experience of the world.

2012-04-27,I am from India so I don't have much of the comic book reading experience which others from US have. But I've been waiting for this movie for over an year now. I have read so many reviews and saw so many Trailers of this movie before actually going to the movie I felt like I watched 90% of the movie. But when I actually saw this movie it blew me away. First and Foremost kudos to Whedon for a wonderful masterpiece. Screenplay was extra ordinary and the way he put all those powerful characters in one frame was simple brilliant. I don't know why but I always thought Iron Man will be like the central character of the movie. But it was great to see HULK made a big impact than any other character. I saw the UK Press conference where Mark Ruffalo said that he was the first person to act both Bruce and Hulk. It was simply amazing. I have never seen such a huge audience and rush for a English movie in so long after Avatar than I've seen today. If you haven't watched it yet. Do not waste any time.

2012-04-24,"I went to the premiere quite apprehensive on several counts: a.) Will Robert Downey Jr. ever get back to the brilliance of Iron Man 1 or have cocky dialogs won over a cool plot? b.) Mark Ruffalo as the hulk? Why not Edward Norton? c.) Hawkeye – not a superhero but just a guy with good aim. Black Widow – no powers again.is she just for eye-candy? d.) Will Hemsworth get more screen time and a better plot than what Thor offered him? e.) Loki the main villain – is this going to be yet another Thor vs Loki battle with the others just chipping in? f.) Will too many superheroes dilute the plot & will they be eating up each other's screen time? g.) Is technology going to win against a good storyline once again? (Ref: All the other Transformer films except the 1st!) h.) So many of them..will Iron Man hold fort in the ""team""?Honestly I didn't even care for Evans and Captain America as much as I did for Thor & Iron Man. And I must say with the runtime being 145 minutes, I wondered if it would be a drag.THE VERDICTThe movie takes time to settle into the plot & setting up the characters, unlike Thor were I felt the movie just rushed through and could have been so much more.The film IS LARGER THAN LIFE. Unlike Iron Man 2 or Captain America which left me wishing they had done more.Loki does a great job of portraying the villain. Thor delivers, Black Widow & Hawkeye are manageable. But nothing can compare to the fact that Ruffalo actually fits this version of Hulk way better than Norton could have done. And of course, Iron Man rocks. Rocks like he never did.By the time you reach the second half, the story has built in enough punch to make you wish there was an epic battle to follow and not a lame effort. And it does deliver.

2012-06-22,"The most recent Marvel comics film efforts have had several things in common - excellent casting, just spot on casting; great characters developed for years through the Marvel comics; good dialogue; but often muddled and/or derivative plots, and usually overlong. For example, Spiderman 3 had chunks of useless segments and a plot shamelessly recycled from earlier Spiderman movies, interspersed with some gorgeous moments of action. This one is interesting. It wouldn't have been as effective without all the introductory movies for many of the characters, including Captain America, Iron Man and Thor, which actually set the table for this main course. The collection of heroes make this movie greater than the sum of the individual works, it just fits like a glove. There are so many good performances - Evans is good again as Capt. A; Downey has made Iron Man his own, and he's got most of the best lines; Ruffalo is amazing as The Hulk; Johannson is solid as the Widow; Jackson and Gregg fit as Nick Fury and his top agent; and just maybe Renner trumps them all as the unflappable Hawkeye. I saw this with my youngest in 3-D, the next night I went back with both my kids and saw it again in 3-D and enjoyed it just as much. Hiddleston does an admirable Jaye Davidson-esque turn as the bad guy, with some help from an other-worldly invasion force. The CGI stuff works, interspersed with some eye-opening live action. The best moment comes when the camera does a slow 360 degree circuit of the Avengers circling the wagons in NYC. There's a lot going on here, and there still is some fat mixed in with the meat, but as a whole this thing just works grandly.

2022-11-12,This movie I gave a 10 not just because I love Marvel but because it's the first superhero live action movie where we saw a team of superheroes fighting together to fight a threat that could change the world. We have not seen that since the first iron man came out and no DC movie has come out with one at the time when it was released. So that fact that we saw that happen was insane and everyone around the world wanted too see it because of that reason and it surpass my expectations and everyone else's too. The movie was great and sets up bigger threats in the movie and in the post credit scenes which I would definitely recommend you staying for.

2018-07-25,"An American fantasy action adventure; A story about a stolen mystical artefact that, if activated, will bring about an alien invasion. A spymaster brings together a team of superheroes to defend Earth from the impending attack. The film has a satisfyingly humorous and lighthearted touch, with Robert Downey Jr. And others delivering fast-talking one-liners that break just at the right time. Some of the humour comes from the battle for supremacy among the Avengers, which is also gratifying. That said, while the visual effects and stunts keep the viewer engaged, it does lag from a lack of imagination in the plot. The fighting is repetitive, and while CGI is used well, some of the cartoonish manoeuvres made by Hulk (in a film trying to keep some semblance of scientific plausibility) are frankly implausible.

I think that Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man was a great casting choice as he is able to show the loving and caring side of Tony Stark and also the cocky, arrogant and snarky side of him. Chris Hemsworth as Thor was also amazing. Some of the lines that he had with the other Avengers were amazing and Hemsworth is good at making it seem as though Thor has no idea why humans do what they do. Chris Evans as Steve Rodgers was somewhat a save for the actors Marvel career, as the last time he appeared in a Marvel movie he played The Human Torch in the very disappointing Fantastic Four movies. He also does very good at acting as though he's from the 1940's. All of the other performances were outstanding but the one that stands out is Tom Hiddleston as Loki.

I'd recommend getting up to speed on a few of the other Marvel films before watching this, you'll have a better understanding of what's going on.One of the biggest surprises and positives was the portrayal of Bruce Banner which I thought came across as excellent, with some really subtle details. The contrasting personalities between Iron Man and Captain America helps fuel the conflict, as well as questions over Nick's Furry's motivations. Thor is conflicted over the responsibility he feels for his brother and his desire to protect the earth. Black Widow is also torn up inside over the fate of Hawkeye and the responsibility she feels for recruiting Banner who certainly didn't ask to join the Avengers. Like X-men (2000), A New Hope (1977), Independence Day (1996), Star trek (2009), the group spend a lot of time bickering and only thinking of themselves as individuals for two thirds group until the final act where they learn to work together as a team and defeat the crazed villain.Expect quite a lot of CGI with the helicarrier, the hulk and of course the final battle, but all the fight sequences are well executed and you can tell the film had a really good director behind it.

If you care about the people you are watching you will automatically enjoy the movie more. Every single character in this movie is played to perfection by their actor or actress which makes you care about the characters which helps make up for the lack of plot because lets be honest, the entire movie takes place on a flying aircraft carrier with the superheroes arguing with each other just waiting for the big finale in New York. Mark Ruffalo finally makes the hulk likable and the CGI hulk was pretty bad ass. Tom Hiddleston is an awesome Loki. He's not as good as he was in Thor, but I'm not sure that was even possible.

2020-10-10,"Joss Whedon had one hell of a hard task. Having to bring in 6 different lovable heroes together in one movie on the big screen was something never done before and he did not disappoint and delivered strong.The acting is superb. I have to admit, Robert Downey Jr was stronger in his solo Iron Man movies but he still pulled off an amazing performance. Chris Evans brought the character to life perfectly, Mark Ruffalo surprisingly pulls off a fantastic performance that does the character to life perfectly and I think you get it. Each actor does each character justice, especially Tom Hiddleston, who brings so much energy and presence on screen.I also love the character's interactions. The dialogue is great and each character rubs off each other really well and I love all their dynamics and chemistry. To be honest, I'd love to just watch a 2 hour movie with the 6 Avengers just talking.The action sequences are so incredible as well. The opening scene is a pretty darn exciting chase scene, Loki's capture scenes, while short, were still pretty fun, the fight between Thor, Captain America and Iron Man did a great job of showing the power of the characters, the Helicarrier scene is really intense, exciting and keeps the viewer on edge and the final battle is so perfect with great camerawork, editing, stakes, consequences, emotional beats and shows the power of each character perfectly and does it full justice.The story is not the most advanced like in The Dark Knight but it's not trying to be and doesn't need to be. It's a simple story with great pacing, dialogue, character interactions, action sequences, clear motives, stakes and consequences and it delivers perfectly.The humor as well is really well-done; it's spaced appropriately, doesn't ruin any emotional beats and the delivery of the actors also play a big part to the great humor.It's not a perfect movie obviously. Captain America's costume is awful and maybe the pacing is a bit off but I don't care. It's a simple story with great characters, screenplay, dialogue, action sequences, humor and emotion and I recommend all Marvel fans to check it out.",10.0,2020-10,Saturday,"acting:0.04, action:0.07, actor:0.05, actors:0.04, all:0.04, also:0.07, amazing:0.04, america:0.06, an:0.03, and:0.31, any:0.04, are:0.02, as:0.05, avengers:0.02, battle:0.05, be:0.07, before:0.04, between:0.04, big:0.08, bit:0.05, bring:0.06, brings:0.06, brought:0.06, but:0.06, captain:0.06, care:0.06, character:0.23, characters:0.05, chris:0.04, dark:0.05, dialogue:0.16, did:0.07, different:0.05, does:0.12, doesn:0.10, don:0.04, done:0.09, downey:0.04, each:0.18, especially:0.05, evans:0.04, exciting:0.12, fans:0.05, fantastic:0.05, fight:0.05, final:0.06, full:0.05, fun:0.04, get:0.03, great:0.17, had:0.03, hard:0.05, have:0.02, having:0.05, he:0.06, heroes:0.04, hiddleston:0.04, his:0.03, hour:0.06, humor:0.14, in:0.07, incredible:0.05, iron:0.06, is:0.16, it:0.16, job:0.05, joss:0.04, jr:0.04, just:0.05, knight:0.05, life:0.10, like:0.03, loki:0.03, love:0.13, man:0.05, mark:0.04, marvel:0.03, maybe:0.05, most:0.04, movie:0.06, movies:0.03, much:0.03, need:0.05, never:0.04, not:0.09, of:0.08, off:0.17, on:0.08, one:0.05, other:0.03, out:0.03, part:0.05, perfect:0.09, perfectly:0.22, performance:0.11, play:0.06, power:0.11, pretty:0.09, really:0.09, recommend:0.06, robert:0.04, ruffalo:0.04, scene:0.13, scenes:0.04, screen:0.08, sequences:0.16, short:0.06, simple:0.11, so:0.08, something:0.04, still:0.08, story:0.09, that:0.02, the:0.37, their:0.03, think:0.04, thor:0.03, to:0.17, together:0.03, tom:0.04, was:0.04, watch:0.03, well:0.12, were:0.03, whedon:0.03, while:0.05, who:0.03, with:0.08, you:0.02"

2012-04-28,"So glad to see that this movie did basically nothing wrong. I had my fears and doubts about it, I mean, so many big superheroes in one movie, isn't that like having too many captains on one ship? But no, everything I feared for got greatly and cleverly handled in the movie and I liked it even far better than expected.The movie simply made all of the right choices it seemed. It used the best elements from the Iron Man movies, ""Thor"", ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" and the Hulk movies. Not only that, it also used the best of its main characters. Everybody of course has their own set of skills, powers and specialties, which greatly get used in the movie. Everybody gets to do something and gets about as much screen time as the other. Many people thought that Tony Stark/Iron Man, played by Robert Downey Jr., would steal the show and get most of the screen time, since his character is the best and most fun one. But no, every hero gets their moment of glory in this movie and their moment to fully shine, even those without the superpowers, such as Black Widow, Hawkeye and Nick Fury, played by Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and Samuel L. Jackson. But if you would force me to point out one person that gets to shine the most in this movie, it would be the Hulk, played this time by Mark Ruffalo. You have never seen the Hulk do so much awesome stuff and he also definitely comes across as the most powerful one of the bunch.It's so awesome and a true accomplishment that they actually pulled it off to get all of these characters and actors together for this one movie. Lots of characters from the Iron Man movies, ""Thor"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" reprise their roles in this movie, which makes all of the movies feel more connected than ever before.It's also a real accomplishment that they managed to keep the same style and tone throughout the entire movie. This also caused Iron Man to not take over the movie for instance, with his wisecracking jokes, or Thor with his old fashioned, Shakespeare-like, dialog. The entire movie feels like one big whole, even when its purely focusing on just one of its main characters.I also really loved the interaction between all of the characters. They don't all like each other and some are even somewhat suspicious of each other. A true ego-clash if you will, which also results at times the different superheroes battling each other. This is the sort of stuff that I'm sure of lots of fan-boys and girls wanted to see. It also was a great move to make Loki the main villain of this movie. He was the best villain, in all of the Marvel superhero movies, in my opinion, so personally I was very glad to see him return, in such a big role again. And yes, every superhero has a go at him at one point in this movie, which again, is something that fan-boys and girls will be drooling at, especially since it's all something truly great and spectacular to watch.And it really is a spectacular movie. Basically it's being like non-stop, action fun and the movie it's final perhaps is the best and most spectacular one you are ever likely to see. Truly some intense and awesome stuff to watch, when all of the superheroes for the very first time truly work as a time and battle side by side with each other. Stuff that will give some people goosebumps for sure, also because it's filmed so extremely well, with the help of some great looking special effects as well.But how about the story? well, it's nothing too great or original but this hardly harms the movie. It's all about its main characters coming together and teaming up for the first time, on film. Really, the story is totally secondary and most of the time you wont even pay attention to it, since there is so much else good stuff going on screen! Joss Whedon did a more than great job with directing this movie.This is basically how great, fun, spectacular, big budget, entertainment should be like!8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,2012-04,Saturday,"10:0.02, about:0.07, action:0.01, actors:0.03, actually:0.03, again:0.05, all:0.11, also:0.16, america:0.04, and:0.26, are:0.03, as:0.08, at:0.07, avenger:0.06, awesome:0.08, battle:0.03, be:0.04, because:0.02, before:0.03, being:0.02, best:0.09, better:0.02, between:0.03, big:0.09, black:0.02, but:0.06, by:0.07, captain:0.04, character:0.02, characters:0.10, comes:0.03, coming:0.03, course:0.03, definitely:0.03, did:0.04, different:0.03, do:0.04, don:0.02, downey:0.02, each:0.08, effects:0.02, else:0.03, entertainment:0.03, entire:0.07, especially:0.03, even:0.10, ever:0.05, every:0.05, everything:0.03, expected:0.03, fan:0.05, far:0.03, feel:0.03, feels:0.03, film:0.02, final:0.03, first:0.08, for:0.07, from:0.03, fun:0.07, fury:0.02, get:0.06, gets:0.12, give:0.03, go:0.02, going:0.02, good:0.02, got:0.03, great:0.10, had:0.02, has:0.03, have:0.01, having:0.03, hawkeye:0.02, he:0.04, help:0.04, hero:0.03, him:0.05, his:0.06, how:0.04, hulk:0.05, if:0.04, in:0.11, iron:0.07, is:0.08, isn:0.03, it:0.18, its:0.09, jackson:0.03, jeremy:0.03, job:0.03, johansson:0.03, joss:0.02, jr:0.02, just:0.02, keep:0.03, like:0.09, liked:0.03, loki:0.02, looking:0.03, loved:0.03, made:0.02, main:0.12, make:0.02, makes:0.02, man:0.06, many:0.07, mark:0.02, marvel:0.02, me:0.02, moment:0.06, more:0.03, most:0.12, movie:0.20, movies:0.08, much:0.06, my:0.03, never:0.02, nick:0.02, no:0.04, not:0.03, nothing:0.05, of:0.20, off:0.02, old:0.03, on:0.06, one:0.14, only:0.02, opinion:0.03, or:0.03, original:0.04, other:0.09, out:0.02, over:0.02, own:0.03, people:0.05, played:0.09, point:0.06, powers:0.04, real:0.03, really:0.05, renner:0.03, right:0.03, robert:0.02, role:0.03, ruffalo:0.02, same:0.03, samuel:0.03, scarlett:0.03, screen:0.07, see:0.07, seemed:0.04, seen:0.02, set:0.03, should:0.03, show:0.03, simply:0.03, since:0.08, so:0.11, some:0.07, something:0.08, special:0.02, spectacular:0.14, stark:0.03, stop:0.03, story:0.04, stuff:0.18, such:0.05, superhero:0.04, superheroes:0.07, sure:0.06, take:0.03, than:0.06, that:0.11, the:0.39, their:0.07, there:0.02, these:0.02, they:0.05, this:0.13, thor:0.05, those:0.03, thought:0.03, throughout:0.03, time:0.12, times:0.03, to:0.15, together:0.04, tony:0.03, too:0.04, true:0.06, truly:0.10, up:0.02, used:0.10, very:0.04, villain:0.05, was:0.04, watch:0.04, well:0.05, whedon:0.02, when:0.04, which:0.08, whole:0.03, widow:0.02, will:0.05, with:0.06, without:0.03, work:0.03, would:0.06, wrong:0.03, yes:0.03, you:0.07"
2019-01-17,"6 May 2012. Few ensemble movies, especially superhero movies offer the balanced, cohesive narrative that make for a well edited, rich character developed, and strongly compelling storyline. Unfortunately for The Avengers, though record-breaking at the box office not withstanding, The Avengers, can at best, be considered entertaining, but is more aptly described as a rather forced piece of movie scriptwriting and directing that attempts to corral a rather disparate bunch of superheros with mixed results. Unlike the more acceptable and appealing television series ensemble of super people in Heroes (2006-2010) or even the more enjoyable animated feature film of super family members in The Incredibles (2004), and the funny team of disparate members including the straight man (female) Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis in Ghostbusters (1984), The Avengers awkwardly introduces its Superheroes almost in sequel form, some with even chaotic brief flashbacks, that results in an uneasy alliance that feels quite uncomfortable as if the Jess Whedon himself was having trouble with his dialogue between the superheroes. As an example, Gwyneth Paltrow, unlike Rick Moranis in Ghostbusters (1984) is never given the opportunity to really have a solid place in the movie. And even the highly praised performance of Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk, even this bi-polar identity is left in doubt as The Hulk is presented as two different personas, earlier in the movie as this Beast and then later somewhat more questionable as this conscientious animal (which as an animal is quite unlikely a transformation). There is an apparent imbalance in the presentation among Ironman and Captain America and Thor. X-Men (2000), Fantastic Four (2005), and Star Trek (2009) all have a much more polished set-ups between their disparate ensemble characters. Instead Joss Whedon has introduced dollops of solid stand-up comic one-liners and humor that seems pretentious clever cover-ups even as they hit home. Unlike his own previous ensemble work in the well received Buffy: The Vampire Slayer (1997-2003) and Angel (1999-2004) series, here Joss Whedon is seemingly unable to recapture the same smooth but edgy magic as those earlier television series. The storyline also seems to veer in several isolated superhero scenes that make the overall rhythm and flow of the story rocky in its depiction on the screen, there seems too many characters and too many simultaneous events going on at the same time, almost more the actor script contractual obligations of screen time rather than for the integrity of the story itself. Inception (2010) probably includes some of the best integrated separate story lines that are presented simultaneously in its unique movie within and movie within a movie technique or Pulp Fiction (1994), Traffic (2001) and The Air I Breathe (2007) interweave several plot strands in a nicely, enriched presented fashion. It is apparent that some efforts at making this movie stand out with a few enhancements in special effects (like the destruction scene shot from the perspective of one of the vehicles being hurdled in the maelstrom) and several minutes of dialogue of lofty sounding metaphysical and emotional depth, yet the overall impact is more superficial without the emotive and intellectual probing found in even more singularly focused superhero movies as Green Lantern (2011), Elektra (2005), Spiderman 2 (2004) or Spiderman 3 (2007). Of particularly, note it almost seems like the news media has been influenced by over-reporting the critical acclaim of this movie as Metacritic rates it only a 69 which while good isn't really outstanding by any means, contributing to a rather false marketing effort in itself suggesting that some movie critics are in league with the movie industry itself.",7.0,2019-01,Thursday,"2012:0.04, actor:0.04, all:0.02, almost:0.12, also:0.03, america:0.02, an:0.08, and:0.23, any:0.03, are:0.04, as:0.23, at:0.09, avengers:0.05, be:0.02, been:0.03, being:0.03, best:0.05, between:0.07, but:0.03, by:0.05, can:0.02, captain:0.02, character:0.02, characters:0.04, comic:0.03, depth:0.05, dialogue:0.08, different:0.04, effects:0.03, ensemble:0.18, entertaining:0.04, especially:0.04, even:0.15, fantastic:0.04, feels:0.04, few:0.07, film:0.02, for:0.05, found:0.05, four:0.05, from:0.02, funny:0.03, given:0.04, going:0.03, good:0.02, has:0.04, have:0.04, having:0.04, here:0.03, heroes:0.03, highly:0.04, his:0.05, hulk:0.04, humor:0.04, if:0.02, in:0.28, instead:0.05, is:0.12, isn:0.04, it:0.04, its:0.08, itself:0.13, joss:0.05, left:0.05, like:0.04, lines:0.04, make:0.06, making:0.04, man:0.02, many:0.06, mark:0.03, may:0.04, minutes:0.04, more:0.18, movie:0.15, movies:0.07, much:0.03, never:0.03, not:0.02, of:0.22, on:0.04, one:0.04, only:0.03, or:0.07, out:0.02, over:0.03, overall:0.08, own:0.03, people:0.03, performance:0.04, place:0.04, plot:0.03, previous:0.04, probably:0.04, quite:0.08, rather:0.19, really:0.05, ruffalo:0.03, same:0.07, scene:0.03, scenes:0.03, screen:0.06, script:0.04, seems:0.17, sequel:0.04, series:0.13, set:0.04, some:0.09, special:0.03, stand:0.09, star:0.04, story:0.07, storyline:0.09, super:0.06, superhero:0.08, superheroes:0.06, team:0.03, than:0.03, that:0.13, the:0.49, their:0.02, then:0.03, there:0.04, they:0.02, this:0.07, thor:0.02, those:0.03, though:0.04, time:0.04, to:0.06, too:0.06, two:0.03, up:0.02, was:0.02, well:0.05, whedon:0.08, which:0.05, while:0.04, with:0.08, without:0.04, work:0.03, yet:0.04"
2012-08-22,"The Avengers displays Joss Whedon's flawless comedic timing, and his ability to balance fun among serious situations perfectly. One can see why Buffy & Angel were a huge success, & Firefly/Serenity a huge cult hit. Welcome to the big leagues, Mr. Whedon.As for the movie, I like this movie's Hulk more than the two stand-alone movies. This movie showcases why the Hulk can work best as a supporting character instead of the lead. Hawkeye, in my opinion, was an odd character to add, and the movie could have done just as well without him. The other characters perform their parts well, but Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark steals the spotlight every time he is on-screen. The chemistry between the cast is seamless. I also loved seeing Coby Smulders as a bad-ass action chick, although its a shame she did not see much action.The only downsides I can think of is the sometimes cheesy dialogs, mostly by Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, and some very loose usage of technical slang.Other than that, here is a toast to The Avengers, and I am surely up for seeing The Avengers 2, Iron Man 3, and (a man can dream) Coby Smulders in an action movie.",8.0,2012-08,Wednesday,"action:0.14, also:0.06, although:0.10, am:0.09, an:0.10, and:0.15, as:0.17, avengers:0.13, bad:0.08, best:0.06, between:0.08, big:0.07, but:0.04, by:0.06, can:0.22, cast:0.08, character:0.12, characters:0.05, could:0.07, did:0.07, done:0.08, downey:0.07, every:0.07, for:0.08, fun:0.08, fury:0.08, have:0.04, hawkeye:0.07, he:0.06, here:0.08, him:0.08, his:0.06, huge:0.19, hulk:0.10, in:0.07, instead:0.11, iron:0.05, is:0.13, its:0.07, jackson:0.09, joss:0.07, jr:0.07, just:0.05, like:0.05, loved:0.10, man:0.10, more:0.06, movie:0.18, movies:0.05, much:0.06, my:0.06, nick:0.08, not:0.04, of:0.09, on:0.05, one:0.04, only:0.06, opinion:0.11, other:0.12, parts:0.11, perfectly:0.10, robert:0.07, samuel:0.09, screen:0.07, see:0.11, seeing:0.19, serious:0.11, she:0.11, some:0.06, stand:0.11, stark:0.08, than:0.12, that:0.04, the:0.44, their:0.06, think:0.07, this:0.07, time:0.05, to:0.13, tony:0.09, two:0.09, up:0.06, very:0.06, was:0.04, well:0.11, were:0.06, whedon:0.13, why:0.17, without:0.09, work:0.08"

2012-06-01,"To start with I cannot understand how anyone can give this under 5 out of 10 stars let alone the ridiculous 1 star ratings. We watched this movie knowing it was going to be a superhero flick so was basically going to have a lot of action scenes and naturally it's going to be full of CGI. Also I expected some one liners that would be witty and corny. If you expected anything different then your previous superhero movie experiences may of been categorized a little wrong. All up it was a great movie and lived up to my expectations which is usually not the case. It was a longer than expected movie and probably could of been shortened a little in the first half but all was forgiven once the heroes started showing off their skills. Some great witty humor, some lines a little corny. The storyline was not too predictable either. Unless of coarse you feel the superheroes saving the day is too predictable.

2012-04-27,"The Avengers have been Assembled, and with great success. Marvel did all the forework flawlessly, all the Superhero movies leading to this 1 make sense now, small bits in those movies are directly or indirectly tied to this one. The Director / Writer: Joss Whedon - did a great job with all the characters, he took some bits out of the old movies and connected the dots, brought out the best in each and all of the characters. The Cast: Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) - he was / is and will be the best choice to play IronMan, he just takes the character to a new level. Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) - was great in Captain America, is absolutely great in this one, i feel like he can play any superhero, he is just the superhero ,,type,, I liked the old costume a bit better but this does not stop the Cap. being the Cap. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) - The God of Thunder...what about that, he feels like the God of Thunder this time, his swing got meaner ( since his ,,Solo Movie,, ) and he swings a lot. Hulk/Bruce Banner ( Mark Ruffalo ) - The unstoppable Force / the Green Rage Monster - oh my: what can i say here - Mark Ruffalo is the best HULK, he ties the absolute HULK: TV's Lou Ferrigno, who gives his voice to the big guy this time ( as he did in all HULK ,,Solo,, movies ). CGI work on HULK is absolutely Fantastic. I feel that Ruffalo plays the clumsy but genius professor Banner better than the others before him ( Eric Bana / Edward Norton ) and this time THE HULK can SMAAAASH ( 4 real ). Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) is a nice addition to the Avengers Team ( he had a short appearance in THOR before ), i feel that he is a bit of an outsider in this one, maybe not that much screen time, but overall he just fits in nicely. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) finally we get a peek in her story outside of the Avengers, she does that catlike fighting that we loved in IronMAn 2, she has some psychologically gripping moments in this one that i loved even more than the fight scenes, nicely done. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury has a dominating presence in this one - we finally see the mastermind / spy / agent finally in work, and he works his ,,magic,, well. Clark Gregg as Agent Caulson is back and he brings not only the comic character but the bad-ass Agent with a ,,punch,,. A nice addition is Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill. Last but not least: Tom Hiddleston as Loki the main villain - Thor's brother ( ,,he's adopted,, ) - He is the absolute villain, played so amazingly by Middleston that he levels the the other characters in each and every aspect, he just balances the movie out - some of his scenes are fantastic.Now to the movie - i guess i can call it the best Superhero Team movie of all time. If u are not familiar with the other MARVEL movies u will not feel like an outsider, this is a Superhero Movie on it's own and a fantastic one. The pace of the movie does not feel to fast and to slow either, script and dialogues are all in place. The Movie has some of the most hilarious comic scenes ever put in any action ( or even some of the recent comedy ) movies, the synergy between the main characters is perfect in any way. Some of the fight scenes will blow you out of your seats, i had some moments that i really wanted to just jump up - or rewind and watch again. Every character has his moments ( or a few great ones) the team-fight scenes just take this to a whole new level. The CGI and FX are just what we are used from Marvel movies, and even upped a bit in this one. Set designs and costumes are also high quality, the design of the HELLICARIER, the MAcH7 suit is fantastic, i really liked Loki's outfit as well. Sound and Music department also did a great job, Alan Silvestri delivered again, the music really captures the mood of the movie.Finally The Pro's: The assemble cast. The character interaction. The Hulk. Black Widow interrogating Loki. The SMAAASH Moments ( a lot of them ). The after credit scene. The Con's: 1 thing - this is not a 3D movie - it has it's moments but if u can avoid watching it as 3D u will not miss a thing.Rating: 8.5 / Fan-boy Rating 9+",9.0,2012-04,Friday,"3d:0.06, about:0.02, absolutely:0.07, action:0.01, after:0.02, again:0.05, agent:0.14, all:0.08, also:0.04, america:0.03, an:0.03, and:0.15, any:0.06, are:0.09, as:0.08, assemble:0.03, avengers:0.04, back:0.03, bad:0.02, banner:0.05, be:0.01, been:0.02, before:0.05, being:0.02, best:0.07, better:0.04, between:0.02, big:0.02, bit:0.08, black:0.04, brings:0.03, brother:0.03, brought:0.03, bruce:0.03, but:0.07, by:0.02, can:0.08, captain:0.03, cast:0.05, cgi:0.05, character:0.07, characters:0.06, chris:0.05, comedy:0.03, comic:0.04, did:0.08, director:0.02, does:0.06, done:0.02, downey:0.02, each:0.04, evans:0.02, even:0.05, ever:0.02, every:0.04, fan:0.02, fantastic:0.11, feel:0.13, feels:0.03, few:0.02, fight:0.08, fighting:0.03, finally:0.11, from:0.01, fury:0.02, get:0.02, god:0.06, got:0.03, great:0.09, guy:0.03, had:0.04, has:0.08, have:0.01, hawkeye:0.02, he:0.30, hemsworth:0.03, her:0.03, here:0.02, hiddleston:0.02, high:0.03, him:0.02, his:0.11, hulk:0.10, if:0.03, in:0.18, iron:0.02, is:0.13, it:0.05, jackson:0.03, jeremy:0.03, job:0.05, johansson:0.02, joss:0.02, jr:0.02, just:0.10, last:0.03, least:0.03, like:0.04, liked:0.06, loki:0.05, lot:0.05, loved:0.06, main:0.06, make:0.02, man:0.02, mark:0.04, marvel:0.05, maybe:0.03, moments:0.13, more:0.02, most:0.02, movie:0.09, movies:0.11, much:0.02, my:0.02, new:0.05, nice:0.07, nick:0.02, norton:0.03, not:0.12, now:0.05, of:0.15, old:0.06, on:0.03, one:0.09, only:0.02, or:0.07, other:0.04, others:0.03, out:0.06, overall:0.03, own:0.03, perfect:0.02, place:0.03, play:0.06, played:0.03, put:0.03, rating:0.06, real:0.03, really:0.05, renner:0.03, robert:0.02, ruffalo:0.06, samuel:0.03, say:0.02, scarlett:0.02, scene:0.02, scenes:0.10, screen:0.02, script:0.03, see:0.02, sense:0.03, set:0.03, she:0.06, short:0.03, since:0.03, so:0.01, some:0.12, stark:0.02, stop:0.03, story:0.02, superhero:0.09, take:0.03, takes:0.03, team:0.07, than:0.04, that:0.10, the:0.54, them:0.02, thing:0.05, this:0.14, thor:0.05, those:0.02, time:0.08, to:0.10, tom:0.02, tony:0.03, up:0.02, used:0.03, villain:0.05, was:0.02, watch:0.02, watching:0.02, way:0.02, we:0.08, well:0.03, what:0.05, whedon:0.02, who:0.02, whole:0.03, widow:0.04, will:0.07, with:0.05, work:0.05, you:0.01, your:0.02"
2012-05-07,"This is a review is in 3 parts: The movie, The message, The future.First the movie is the sum of its parts. They are done well which seems undisputed from movie making, acting, special effects....etc...POV. However it ISN'T MORE than the sum of its parts which we consider the classics to be. It's like addition, but NO multiplication. It is so segmented and connected by convenient superficial ways. As far as box office records, it should make this much money given the awareness of this movie since IRon MAn, 6 individual movies and the increase in ticket prices. If it didn't then it would be an unmitigated disaster.Secondly the Message, it is a war mongering movie. It declares that we have to fight whoever to the death and we will be victorious. Contrast that with the message of the Dark Knight, which tries to say we can overcome this violence some other way and sometimes to do that, there is no clear victory or nor should there be. That ultimately too much war or too much peace is too imbalanced to survive or thrive. So you see the different styles serve their messages where Avengers tries to not go too deep and NOT show much of the ugliness while Dark Knight shows it all.Finally, the future. There is tug of war between people who think we are doomed to fight it out or we can find another way. The END DAYS vs. the beginning of new era. What we believe is what will happen because actions will be driven by them. If the Avengers approaches the Dark KNight or surpasses it. Then we are Doomed :(. To show we aren't doomed, go see it once, but no more to show you are open :).We need a landmark movie to bridge these two sides.

2012-05-09,"As I finished watching the Avengers, the main thought in my head was, why on earth did they get Joss Whedon to write this???? Whedon is a master of witty, earthy dialogue and anyone who's ever watched Buffy, Angel or Firefly knows that he can direct action scenes and powerful interpersonal character connections, often in the same scene. Who directed this bland, one-dimensional shoot-em-up and what have you done with Joss Whedon? This humorless CGI fest could have been handled by any number of robotic Hollywood hacks. I looked forward to this movie because I was over the moon with excitement at the thought that it COULDN'T be a typical jump-cut, screaming video game, and that's pretty much what we have here. The jokes are flat and the dialogue is embarrassing. I thought Scarlett Johannsson was charming, and I usually don't like her too much. But even worse is how the always incredibly watchable Mark Ruffalo was rendered a total snooze, how is that possible? Robert Downey is sarcastic as always and fun to watch but...

2012-11-10,"Avengers Assemble is incredible to say the least and I wasn't in anyway disappointed with it. Before I saw it, I decided to watch Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America and Thor so I'd be all prepared for it. I mean it's everything you'd want from a great movie: excellent action, excellent directing, an excellent cast of actors, excellent dialogue, excellent special effects and an excellent script. I bet it was hard deciding on who would direct this movie with such high expectations but Joss Whedon, who created such TV series like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly, was the best choice and he directed it perfectly. I mean he didn't overdid like Michael Bay does with action movies. He actually had it well thought-out and the action really works in the movie. It's amazing how you can take a bunch of superheroes from separate movies and come together to make one fantastic movie. Now all the actors did great, but I think Tony Stark/Iron Man is the life of the party because he's the funniest and coolest and Robert Downey Jr. is one of my favourite actors ever. Also Scarlett Johansson, one of my favourite actresses, is tough as she is sexy as Black Widow. And I like the different relationships between the characters. In fact, in my opinion, it's ten times better than The Dark Knight because The Dark Knight was too dark and overdone. But I can't really decide whether The Avengers is better than The Dark Knight Rises because both movies blew my mind away!But after seeing this movie, I've decided that I ought to get reading superhero comics because they're the original source and I love superheroes. But for the next Avengers movie, I'm really hoping that they put Spider-Man and Wolverine in even though most people say it's highly unlikely.

2012-07-01,"""There was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people, so when we needed them, they could fight the battles that we never could."" After the God Loki finds his way to Earth, steals the powerful Tesseract and is close to fulfilling his goal of destroying the planet there is only one group that can stop him. After years of recruiting Nick Fury's (Jackson) team is ready. This is a movie that people will pretty much just watch without any prompting or reading reviews because of the hype and build up but I'll do one anyway. I have to start by saying that I never was a huge comic book movie person. When they first started being made it was pretty much just how much stuff can we explode and how cool can we make it look. Over the years they have been getting better and better and I think the success of the ""Batman"" movies by Christopher Nolan has raised the bar. He has shown that a real story, plot and great acting can make a typical ""popcorn"" movie into a legitimate movie. All the years of honing the genre have led to this. Not only is this a fun movie to watch but it is also a great acted movie and everyone is perfectly cast. Downey is the leader but is in no way overpowering and this has the feel of a real ensemble cast movie in the way that ""Crash"" did. After years of movies like the ""Fantastic 4"" and ""Spiderman"" they finally realized the key to not just making a good comic book movie, but a great movie period. Good acting and writing are needed. Both are on display here. I have said for years that I am not a comic book movie fan...this movie may have changed my mind. Overall, not just a good and fun comic book movie but a good a fun movie...period.

2023-10-12,"After a significant build-up consisting of several movies introducing various iconic characters, Marvel finally delivered The Avengers, their big superhero crossover and the most ambitious comic-book movie adaptation at that time.Directed by Joss Whedon, with an all-star cast portraying the likes of Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth), plus a long hinted-at plot that gets to the point right away, the film quickly broke a billion dollars at the box-office and it remains one of the most popular movies of all time. Marvel's bold, expensive move paid off, to say the least, and comic-book movies are still just as big as they were back in 2012, some would say more so.Seeing all these characters together in the same film was certainly a main draw for audiences but without such a talented and dedicated cast, it's arguably unlikely that the film would have spawned as many sequels and spin-offs as it did and led to the continuation of Marvel's (and Disney's) comic-book movie domination. The story sees Loki (Tom Hiddleston) use the Tesseract to open a space portal thereby allowing all sorts of villainous creatures into the world as Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles his team of Avengers to stop him.Keeping the plot simple was certainly a good move as anything more convoluted than that could have gotten pretty messy. On the other hand, having the film just be about a one-dimensional villain we've already seen in another movie use a macguffin for some vague megalomaniac endgame he doesn't even seem all that devoted to, makes The Avengers feel a little slight depth-wise. Loki himself isn't quite as interesting as he was in Thor but Tom Hiddleston keeps him charming and fun throughout. Most of the enemies the Avengers face, however, are faceless no-name aliens and are only there to be disposed of.One third of the film is dedicated to introducing characters old and new like Bruce Banner/The Hulk, played by a perfectly cast Mark Ruffalo, the middle part follows Loki's escape and the Avengers having to deal with that, while the finale is just one big New York City-set battle. The film is long but it's paced well with key action beats and, whenever the heroes are interacting with each other, even if they're just standing around discussing exposition, it's a joy.The Avengers isn't a perfect film. As I mentioned earlier, it isn't exactly a challenging watch, which is both good and not-so-good but altogether understandable. It has quite a few ropey moments, especially near the beginning when Loki shows up to brainwash Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), or whenever some alien thing we don't know is talking next to a glowing staircase somewhere on a space rock, or when a joke doesn't quite hit the mark. And it's a shame that Loki never gets a final fight against all the Avengers or at least his brother Thor.Instead, he just basically gives up about halfway through. This is a slick-looking movie with some impressive CG effects (Hulk looks great, mostly) and it's never dull but the cast really is the glue that holds the whole thing together: Robert Downey Jr.'s wit, Chris Evans' earnest heroism, Scarlett Johansson's super-spy antics, all of that comes together beautifully and it effortlessly fleshes out characters you wouldn't necessarily expect to care this much about, let alone at all.There's no denying what a huge achievement The Avengers was. The fact that Marvel planned out such a ridiculous project so meticulously and it somehow all led to a genuinely solid, entertaining blockbuster is worth celebrating. The film itself is slightly uneven but it's so full of charm and boasts enough cleverly put-together set-pieces that, for any comic-book fan especially, this is simply a treat.Excelsior!",6.0,2023-10,Thursday,"2012:0.04, about:0.07, action:0.02, after:0.03, against:0.04, alien:0.04, all:0.15, already:0.04, america:0.02, an:0.02, and:0.23, another:0.04, any:0.03, anything:0.04, are:0.07, around:0.04, as:0.16, at:0.11, avengers:0.14, away:0.04, back:0.03, banner:0.03, battle:0.04, be:0.04, beginning:0.04, big:0.09, blockbuster:0.04, book:0.13, both:0.04, brother:0.04, bruce:0.03, but:0.09, by:0.05, captain:0.02, care:0.05, cast:0.13, certainly:0.09, characters:0.08, chris:0.10, comes:0.04, comic:0.11, could:0.03, depth:0.05, did:0.03, doesn:0.07, don:0.03, downey:0.06, each:0.03, effects:0.03, enough:0.03, entertaining:0.04, especially:0.07, evans:0.07, even:0.05, expect:0.04, face:0.05, fact:0.04, fan:0.03, feel:0.03, few:0.03, fight:0.03, film:0.16, final:0.04, finally:0.04, for:0.05, full:0.04, fun:0.03, fury:0.03, gets:0.08, good:0.06, great:0.02, has:0.02, have:0.04, having:0.08, hawkeye:0.03, he:0.07, hemsworth:0.04, heroes:0.03, hiddleston:0.07, him:0.07, his:0.05, however:0.04, huge:0.04, hulk:0.04, if:0.02, impressive:0.05, in:0.06, instead:0.05, interesting:0.04, into:0.03, iron:0.02, is:0.13, isn:0.12, it:0.16, itself:0.04, jackson:0.03, jeremy:0.04, johansson:0.03, joss:0.03, jr:0.06, just:0.10, know:0.03, least:0.08, let:0.04, like:0.02, little:0.03, loki:0.12, long:0.07, looking:0.04, looks:0.04, main:0.04, makes:0.03, man:0.02, many:0.03, mark:0.06, marvel:0.09, moments:0.04, more:0.05, most:0.08, movie:0.06, movies:0.06, much:0.02, never:0.06, new:0.07, next:0.04, nick:0.03, no:0.05, not:0.02, of:0.15, off:0.03, old:0.04, on:0.04, one:0.07, only:0.03, or:0.07, other:0.05, out:0.04, part:0.04, perfect:0.03, perfectly:0.04, played:0.04, plot:0.06, point:0.04, pretty:0.04, put:0.04, quite:0.11, re:0.04, really:0.02, renner:0.04, right:0.03, robert:0.06, ruffalo:0.03, same:0.03, samuel:0.04, say:0.06, scarlett:0.03, seeing:0.04, seem:0.05, seen:0.03, set:0.08, simple:0.04, simply:0.04, so:0.08, some:0.09, star:0.04, still:0.03, stop:0.04, story:0.02, such:0.07, super:0.03, superhero:0.03, team:0.03, tesseract:0.05, than:0.03, that:0.16, the:0.44, their:0.02, there:0.04, these:0.03, they:0.04, thing:0.07, this:0.04, thor:0.07, through:0.04, throughout:0.05, time:0.04, to:0.17, together:0.10, tom:0.07, up:0.07, ve:0.03, villain:0.03, was:0.07, watch:0.03, we:0.06, well:0.02, were:0.02, what:0.02, whedon:0.03, when:0.05, which:0.03, while:0.04, whole:0.04, with:0.08, without:0.04, world:0.03, worth:0.04, would:0.05, york:0.04, you:0.02"
2024-06-16,"""The Avengers,"" directed by Joss Whedon, brings together Marvel's iconic heroes in a thrilling ensemble film. Featuring Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye, the movie delivers a high-energy blend of action, humor, and character dynamics.The cast's chemistry is a highlight, with Robert Downey Jr.'s charismatic Tony Stark and Chris Evans' earnest Steve Rogers leading the charge. The interplay between characters, especially during their initial clashes, adds depth to the narrative. Tom Hiddleston's Loki, as the main antagonist, brings a blend of charm and menace that elevates the stakes.Visually, the film impresses with its large-scale action sequences and special effects, particularly in the climactic battle in New York City. Whedon's direction ensures a balanced screen time for each hero, allowing their distinct personalities to shine.However, the plot can feel somewhat predictable, following a conventional superhero blueprint. While the film excels in spectacle, it occasionally lacks the emotional depth of its individual character films.Overall, ""The Avengers"" is a satisfying and entertaining culmination of Marvel's Phase One, providing fans with a memorable and action-packed cinematic experience.",7.0,2024-06,Sunday,"action:0.15, america:0.06, and:0.23, as:0.05, avengers:0.09, battle:0.10, between:0.09, black:0.07, brings:0.23, by:0.06, can:0.06, captain:0.06, cast:0.09, character:0.13, characters:0.06, chris:0.09, cinematic:0.12, depth:0.24, downey:0.07, each:0.07, effects:0.07, ensemble:0.12, entertaining:0.10, especially:0.10, evans:0.09, experience:0.11, fans:0.09, feel:0.09, film:0.16, films:0.08, for:0.04, hawkeye:0.08, hero:0.09, heroes:0.07, hiddleston:0.09, high:0.10, however:0.10, hulk:0.05, humor:0.09, in:0.15, individual:0.12, iron:0.06, is:0.07, it:0.04, its:0.15, joss:0.07, jr:0.08, loki:0.07, main:0.10, man:0.06, marvel:0.12, movie:0.04, new:0.09, of:0.14, one:0.05, overall:0.10, packed:0.11, plot:0.08, robert:0.07, screen:0.08, sequences:0.11, special:0.08, stark:0.09, superhero:0.07, that:0.04, the:0.45, their:0.13, thor:0.06, time:0.06, to:0.07, together:0.07, tom:0.09, tony:0.09, whedon:0.14, while:0.09, widow:0.08, with:0.13, york:0.12"

2012-05-02,"I've been waiting for this movie since i was a kid reading Avengers #177 where they're all defeated by Michael/Korvac, and thinking, ""hang on, they're not supposed to be ALL defeated!"" I was hooked on these guys since then. 1978 i think.Anyway, i was more than worried about this film because it was to be very much MY film! I'd invested a lot of myself in these characters. I wouldn't be at all pleased if it didn't live up how awesome i know these characters have been written over the years. The battles, scars and losses they've had to endure. I thought it was going to be a kid flick! Pure and simple. That it wouldn't round the character's personalities enough, and the script would be too simple. Plus Joss Whedon WAS under my radar as a director. I hadn't gotten into Buffy or Firefly and anyway, let's just say i wasn't overly keen on the director. Nothing personal, or derivative of his craft and skills, but this was a boyhood dream taking form. People i spoke with about it all rated him though. So, as per usual i tried to keep away from as many clips, interviews, rumours etc as possible. I like to go into the show knowing as little as possible. I only watched trailers. Anyway, i went to see it in 2D on Wednesday 25th with a friend. Full of expectation and dread, heheh. All i can say is, Whedon has made an Avengers movie we fans can be so proud of. The Dark Knight for me is a monumental film, and easily was the best supe movie project ever executed. Until now that is. THE best supe team is now all together in a live action film. And they have been drawn together beautifully by Whedon's script. The mind boggles as to who else they will bring into this universe. Respect is due to the research, and his interpretation of how these characters work together. He nailed it. I'm not sure anyone else would have. Maybe not even Nolan himself! Whedon's view of them was almost exactly how i have interpreted their relationships over the years. I've seen The Avengers twice now already, and will probably go again before the Bluray release. That will be an occasion too, i'm sure. I've got to give the score a mention too. It's on repeat in my headphones at the moment, because its bloody great! You hardly notice it during the film because of the awesome visuals and dialogue, but i recommend having a listen to it alone. Alan Silvestri is a master of action cinema. He did Predator for god's sake! He delivers royally here. Check it out. I couldn't be happier about The Avengers. When Iron Man came out Downey-Junior was perfectly cast, and to top it all, a great movie was made, i thought maybe it could be the time when a really cool Avengers movie would be made.

2012-11-07,"Being the comic book junkie that I am, and seeing numerous attempts at making decent super hero/vigil-anti films, most of which ending in disaster. From the terrible 'Fantastic Four' films to the ridiculously awful 'Thor' film, there was no doubt in my mind that the film would lack any real substance, but instead focus on immature, repetitive, one- liners. My only true incentive for paying to see this in theaters was Joss Whedon being the writer and director. That being said I enjoyed the 'Iron Man,' 'Captain America,' and 'Hulk' films as well. My expectations were low for this ensemble super hero flick, as I sat in the back row of the movie theater. It was surprisingly very good. it was well written(for the most part), the acting was superb, the plot was juicy and consistent, the characters were believable, and the CGI and other effects were great. The film had many one liners, but they were mature, well thought out, humorous, and best of all: the film didn't rely on them to make itself memorable.Aside from the over the top Thor and Loki characters, and far too fast progressing beginning the film was excellent. The film began very fast, and then suddenly slowed down which was a slight bit annoying.

2012-05-28,"I really enjoyed Captain America, Thor, and the first Iron Man, but The Avengers is just a mostly boring, repetitive, excessively long mess of self-indulgence. You'd never know that the talented Joss Whedon directed -- the film has none of his trademark sly humor, cleverness or pacing.Instead we get a needlessly long film short on everything but action. While Mark Ruffalo is excellent as Bruce Banner / The Hulk, the rest of the cast is pretty much cardboard. Frankly, it's just a dumb film and just because it's popular does not mean it's a good film.So if you like lots of action, wooden dialog, dumb plots, and, well a lot of noise, you'll love this mess of a film. But if you expect to see a film that's better than the best episodes of Josh Whedon's ""Buffy"" or want more from a film, be prepared to be disappointed.",4.0,2012-05,Monday,"action:0.11, america:0.07, and:0.11, as:0.05, avengers:0.05, banner:0.10, be:0.11, because:0.08, best:0.07, better:0.09, boring:0.13, bruce:0.10, but:0.14, captain:0.07, cast:0.09, disappointed:0.13, does:0.09, enjoyed:0.12, everything:0.10, excellent:0.12, expect:0.12, film:0.41, first:0.08, from:0.06, get:0.08, good:0.06, has:0.06, his:0.07, hulk:0.06, humor:0.10, if:0.14, instead:0.14, iron:0.06, is:0.12, it:0.12, joss:0.08, just:0.18, know:0.09, like:0.06, ll:0.12, long:0.21, lot:0.09, love:0.10, man:0.06, mark:0.08, more:0.07, much:0.07, never:0.09, not:0.05, of:0.26, on:0.06, or:0.13, pretty:0.11, really:0.07, rest:0.12, ruffalo:0.08, see:0.07, short:0.13, so:0.06, than:0.07, that:0.09, the:0.28, this:0.04, thor:0.07, to:0.08, want:0.10, we:0.08, well:0.07, whedon:0.15, while:0.10, you:0.22"
2012-04-29,"The Avengers (titled rather cheesily 'Avengers Assemble' in some countries including the UK) has been anticipated ever since Iron Man in 2008. Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger have all built up to this pinnacle of Marvel movies. The star-packed cast includes Robert Downey Jr. returning as Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America and Chris Hemsworth reprises his role as God of Thunder from Asgard, Thor. Also Mark Ruffalo replaces Edward Norton as gamma-ray exposed scientist Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk. Scarlett Johannson returns as Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow from the second Iron Man and Jeremy Renner stars as expert marksman Clint Barton (Hawkeye.) Tom Hiddleston plays villain Loki and Samuel L. Jackson returns as SHIELD director Nick Fury. Cobie Smulders, Clark Gregg and Stellan Skarsgard round out the cast.The premise of this movie is relatively simple; Loki wants control of The Earth after the events of Thor and will do this with the help of an alien race and the Tesseract from Captain America. SHIELD then puts together a team of remarkable people to fight the battles that they never could, to quote the inspirational words of Nick Fury. And to quote Tony Stark, these are a demigod, a super-soldier, a man with breathtaking anger management issues and a couple of master assassins. They must protect, or avenge, The Earth.This film was first heard about four years ago and has gained a substantial amount of hype ever since the teaser trailer in the summer of 2011. Nine months and numerous exciting trailers and TV spots later, it is here. And yes it delivers, very well. One of the best things about this is the characters. Because they are all humans, you feel for them and care about them. And Loki, a fantastic villain played tremendously by Hiddleston, has a way of getting under all of their skins, hence his title of the God of Mischief. The acting is great and it goes without saying that Downey Jr. is amazing and hilarious. As is the whole movie; Joss Whedon's superb script delivers many witty and memorable lines so much so that you will want to laugh out loud in a lot of moments, mostly involving Stark or The Hulk. Particular scene involving the green behemoth and Loki or Thor are outstanding. The action is brilliant as well and I would recommend seeing it in 3D; the last third of the movie is definitely improved in three dimensions. From the fast-paced, exciting, opening scene through recruitment and the Manhattan carnage, this is an exciting, emotional, funny and perfectly executed film with great CGI. Also there are many moments where you just want to yell out AWWW YEAHHH!!!There are just a few bad points here; but they are minor. First, I would have liked to have seen Nick Fury and Agent Hill fighting more in Manhattan, despite doing some things on the Helicarrier. Also it dawdles a bit too much on the first half, however this doesn't detract at all from what is DEFINITELY a 10/10 motion picture.",10.0,2012-04,Sunday,"10:0.07, 3d:0.04, about:0.08, acting:0.04, action:0.02, after:0.03, agent:0.05, alien:0.05, all:0.07, also:0.09, amazing:0.04, america:0.08, amount:0.05, an:0.05, and:0.32, are:0.13, as:0.18, assemble:0.05, at:0.02, avenger:0.05, avengers:0.04, bad:0.04, banner:0.04, because:0.03, been:0.03, best:0.03, bit:0.04, black:0.03, brilliant:0.05, bruce:0.04, but:0.02, by:0.03, captain:0.08, care:0.05, cast:0.07, cgi:0.04, characters:0.02, chris:0.07, could:0.03, definitely:0.09, director:0.04, do:0.03, doesn:0.04, downey:0.06, earth:0.08, evans:0.04, ever:0.07, exciting:0.15, fantastic:0.04, feel:0.04, few:0.04, fight:0.04, fighting:0.05, film:0.04, first:0.12, for:0.02, four:0.05, from:0.12, funny:0.04, fury:0.11, getting:0.05, god:0.09, goes:0.05, great:0.05, half:0.05, has:0.07, have:0.06, hawkeye:0.03, help:0.05, hemsworth:0.04, here:0.07, hiddleston:0.08, his:0.05, however:0.04, hulk:0.07, hype:0.05, in:0.11, incredible:0.08, iron:0.12, is:0.15, it:0.07, jackson:0.04, jeremy:0.04, joss:0.03, jr:0.07, just:0.05, last:0.04, liked:0.05, lines:0.05, loki:0.11, lot:0.04, man:0.14, many:0.07, mark:0.03, marvel:0.02, moments:0.08, more:0.03, movie:0.05, movies:0.02, much:0.06, must:0.04, never:0.04, nick:0.11, norton:0.05, of:0.26, on:0.04, one:0.02, or:0.08, out:0.08, packed:0.05, people:0.03, perfectly:0.05, played:0.05, rather:0.05, recommend:0.05, renner:0.04, robert:0.03, role:0.05, ruffalo:0.03, samuel:0.04, scarlett:0.04, scene:0.08, script:0.04, second:0.05, seeing:0.04, seen:0.03, simple:0.05, since:0.08, so:0.05, some:0.05, star:0.05, stark:0.11, stars:0.05, summer:0.05, super:0.04, team:0.03, tesseract:0.05, that:0.05, the:0.43, their:0.03, them:0.06, then:0.04, there:0.05, these:0.03, they:0.09, things:0.08, this:0.11, thor:0.10, through:0.04, to:0.10, together:0.03, tom:0.04, tony:0.08, too:0.03, up:0.03, very:0.03, villain:0.07, want:0.08, wants:0.06, was:0.02, way:0.03, well:0.05, what:0.03, whedon:0.03, where:0.04, whole:0.04, widow:0.03, will:0.05, with:0.05, without:0.04, witty:0.05, would:0.06, years:0.04, yes:0.05, you:0.06"
2024-06-09,"I have to say that the furore surrounding this film had pretty much doomed it to failure in my book. The Marvel marketing machine had gone into over-drive plugging it, so no way could it be any good. Well, it is good. Not great, but it is good. The compendium element of the storyline pits all of the superheroes against the mischievous ""Loki"" (a cute, curly haired, Tom Hiddleston) whom, together with his army of extraterrestrial henchmen, is bent on taking over the world... well, of course he is... The writing is nothing special at all, but who cares? The visual effects are great and each of the characters gets their moment in the sun as they work to thwart our Tom's even plotting. Robert Downey Jr. Steals the show as engineering genius ""Tony Stark"" with Scareltt Johansson and Chris Hemsworth - and his trusty hammer - on great form too. I'm afraid I find the whole ""Capt. America"" character so nauseatingly wholesome that even Chris Evans in his spray-on lycra cannot do anything other than put me firmly in the baddies camp right from the get-go. On the downside, Mark Ruffalo tries hard with the rather limited opportunities offered him as the rather dull ""Hulk"", and Clark Gregg continues to prove he must be one of the luckiest actors alive to have alighted on this franchise - he is hopelessly wooden as ""Coulson"" but as a piece of fast-paced fantasy entertainment this film takes some beating (""Star Wars"" notwithstanding). It is too long - the fight/chase scenes can get a tad recycled and repetitive after a while but it all builds well to a fitting crescendo that did make me wonder whether the impeding alien invasion may have ended up causing less damage than the saviours of mankind did! No point watching if you're not up for a complete suspension of reality - this is a top class adventure with loads of quirky characters, a bit of humour, plenty of fisticuffs and even a bit of Schubert!!

There's an intelligent sharp script, virtual non-stop action, incredible special effects and 2 1/2 hours that just fly by. This one of those rare comic book movies where everything is done right!

2012-05-10,"The Avengers is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a magnificent cast. This movie is certainly what all Marvel fans have been waiting for, it's been building up since Iron Man came out in 2008, and despite all the hype it actually did not end up being even a little bit disappointing. Cast members reprising their roles continue to shine, such as Robert Downey Jr. and Samuel L. Jackson, but even the new members deliver great performances, such as Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo, without a doubt the best Bruce Banner to date, I hope to see him do a solo Hulk movie soon. It looks absolutely beautiful, Joss Whedon was the right choice to direct, it seemed like a messy concept bringing them all together and trying to focus on each character individually, it would have been hard to make it work, but Marvel did it right. An amazing ride from start to finish, the Avengers is the movie superhero fans have been waiting for, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or adventure.

2012-05-19,"After waiting a couple weeks, I finally got to see The Avengers with my movie theatre-working friend. Yay, I have now seen Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, and the Hulk battle Loki and his minions from Asgard as the latter try to invade New York City. Co-written and directed by legendary TV icon Joss Whedon (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Angel"", and ""Firefly""), he does not disappoint with his love of pop culture and comics as he gives the Marvel characters their justly celebrated status as the distinct characters we've grown to love growing up reading their illustrated adventures in the four-color world they inhabit. And seeing it all in 3-D is such an awesome experience! Oh, and it's great in also seeing Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Nick Fury in tow. Really, all I'll say is you must watch The Avengers. P.S. Seeing Cobie Smulders as one of the characters makes me wonder if she and her ""How I Met Your Mother"" co-star Alyson Hannigan, formerly a ""Buffy"" star, have traded stories of what it's like to work for Mr. Whedon.

2012-04-28,I had the highest of expectations for this film and it over delivered. I would advise you watch in Imax 3d. It was just incredible - the effects - the story line - the humour... the whole cinema was crying with laughter at some parts. The Hulk is scripted better than ever - finally he has been done properly. Banner delivers in every way as normal and he does have a soft spot! I watched this last night and am going to go watch it again today. As an add on for anyone who cant be bothered to travel to see a film like this in IMAX - you really need to make the effort - you wont visit a normal cinema again!

2012-05-06,"So, every few years we get an obligatory Hollywood presentation of a comic book story. These films can be either really really good (films like The Dark Knight, Iron Man,) or really really bad (films like last year's Captain America). Personally, I'm a fan of movies in general. I'm no comic book freak, and before seeing this film I really couldn't tell you the first thing about the Avengers. But I was told this was gonna be the one, the superhero movie that I would love more than any of them. This was hyped up to be the best yet. It has all our favorite heroes, plenty of crazy action and breathtaking special effects, and a star- studded cast. So, I had high hopes and was excited to see this movie, which is rare for me when a new superhero movie comes out.From beginning to end there is no denying that this is the year's first blockbuster. I'm not going to waste time describing the movie though, as honestly, we have seen it all before. Basic save the world plot, but with a medley of all the most famous and powerful superheros. What this movie does do is take special effects to new heights. This is by no means a thinking mans film, but it is not supposed to be. This ones about getting the bad guy, and causing a whole lot of explosions and plenty of adrenaline-pumping battles. Robert Downey Jr. shines as usual as Tony Stark, and his performance is the showstopper and shining moment of this movie. All in all, there is something for every kind of movie fan here. It does what a blockbuster should do, entertain us and captivate us for a few hours with it's big-budget effects and simple story line. This is nothing we haven't seen before though, and while it is worth a second viewing (especially for the die-hards), it is nothing that I will spend my time raving on and on about.Overall: 7/10",7.0,2012-05,Sunday,"10:0.05, about:0.12, action:0.03, all:0.13, america:0.04, an:0.03, and:0.26, any:0.05, as:0.08, avengers:0.03, bad:0.11, be:0.12, before:0.16, beginning:0.07, best:0.04, big:0.05, blockbuster:0.13, book:0.10, but:0.08, by:0.04, can:0.04, captain:0.04, cast:0.05, comes:0.06, comic:0.09, couldn:0.07, dark:0.06, do:0.09, does:0.10, downey:0.04, effects:0.13, end:0.05, especially:0.06, every:0.10, fan:0.11, favorite:0.06, few:0.11, film:0.06, films:0.14, first:0.08, for:0.10, from:0.03, get:0.04, getting:0.07, going:0.05, good:0.03, guy:0.06, had:0.04, has:0.03, have:0.03, haven:0.07, here:0.05, heroes:0.04, high:0.06, his:0.04, hollywood:0.07, hours:0.07, in:0.04, iron:0.03, is:0.23, it:0.15, jr:0.05, kind:0.07, knight:0.06, last:0.06, like:0.06, line:0.07, lot:0.05, love:0.05, man:0.03, me:0.04, moment:0.07, more:0.04, most:0.04, movie:0.16, movies:0.03, my:0.04, new:0.11, no:0.12, not:0.06, nothing:0.11, of:0.18, on:0.06, one:0.03, or:0.04, our:0.07, out:0.04, overall:0.06, performance:0.07, plot:0.05, really:0.19, robert:0.04, save:0.07, second:0.06, see:0.04, seeing:0.06, seen:0.09, should:0.05, simple:0.07, so:0.06, something:0.05, special:0.10, star:0.07, stark:0.05, story:0.08, superhero:0.08, take:0.06, than:0.04, that:0.07, the:0.25, them:0.04, there:0.07, these:0.05, thing:0.06, this:0.21, though:0.11, time:0.07, to:0.12, tony:0.06, up:0.04, us:0.12, was:0.10, we:0.14, what:0.07, when:0.04, which:0.04, while:0.06, whole:0.06, will:0.04, with:0.05, world:0.05, worth:0.06, would:0.04, year:0.12, years:0.05, yet:0.06, you:0.03"
2012-05-03,"The world is in danger. Loki, Thor's brother threatens to destroy earth. He has amassed a legion to annihilate earth. It seems, the destruction is imminent. It is in these times that Nick Fury of SHIELD decides to bring together an amazing team of superheroes who are not used to working as a team, don't like taking orders from a mere mortal and above all like to work on their own terms, especially Stark and Hulk. It is this attitude of their's that probably sets them apart from the rest of the superheroes. What follows is awesomeness at its best.Its not just another action-adventure flick. Its epic. Its action, adventure, comedy, wittiness all combined into one. Its a complete package. It doesn't really matter whether you are into superhero stuff, doesn't matter what age group you belong too, you are going to enjoy it anyhow. Hulk and Iron Man are the pillars of the movie. Mark Ruffalo has done an amazing job, especially when he turns into ""the other guy"". The HULK is the cynosure of the movie. Never seen Hulk like this. He is bigger, better, stronger and angrier..that's the best part. He is here to do what he does best..""smash"".. Robert Downey aka Tony Stark, our genius, billionaire, philanthropist, playboy, with his arrogance and ""don't give a damn attitude"" would definitely win your heart. Thor, the God of thunder played by Chris Hemsworth is back on earth to kick some Loki ass. Tom Hiddleston or Loki who is bent on destroying earth is quite convincing as the evil guy. Captain America seemed to lack conviction. Probably its because I am not a Captain America fan. Agent Bart aka Hawk Eye & Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow, though mere mortals with no superhuman ability, play an important part in saving the blue planet from annihilation. I was surprised to see Cobie Smulders of HIMYM fame.

2012-04-28,"After a long time of waiting finally The Avengers is released. I have waited for this movie from last 3 years. Iron man series is one of my favorite superhero series and I love to see every movie in which Iron man was there. So after long time I went to cinema hall with my cousin and watched the assemble of 4 superhero Hulk, Thor, Iron man, Captain America to save the world with help of Director Nick Fury and his agents Black Widow and Hawkeye.As movies starts it is more concentrated to storytelling and linking of the previous movies Ironman 2, Captain America: The First Avenger, Thor and Hulk. The first half part is about summoned of these superheroes. Another part is packed with superb visual effects and sound effects also dialogs are awesome. Especially Iron man's dialogs are hilarious and quick witted.The movie is well balanced with story and action scenes some movies are failed to adopt this phenomenon such as Transformers 3 Dark side of moon and Ghost rider 2 spirit of vengeance.

Gonna love to give him credit for making this film not just a Sci-Fi Action but also showered some great humor.*Effects - This factor is widely visible. Joss Whedon & Co. has a great vision. Unlike some transformers sound & visual effects, this film has greater eye catcher. *Story/Plot - Although the ending & climax scenes were as expected, the whole story & scripts were made you think it is flawlessly made simply because the whole story is simple; from the beginning of LOKI's plans of Mayhem and Assembling the Avengers.***OVERALL (8.7/10)it was Entertaining, Avery Well Executed Film!!! You get a double of the price you paid for.

After seeing this movie i left the cinema that cold rainy night feeling overwhelmly satisfied. Rarely you find a gem of a film in life and this has to be one of them. Marvel's best live action movie since X-Men 2. I was gripped to my seat and didn't even notice the 2 hours slip by. I didn't even stay for the end credits where i'm told a small clip is played which will certainly mean a sequel. I didn't stay for the end credits because i spontaneously rushed to see this film alone for the first time in my life. Don't laugh!!! I only regret that i couldn't share this extravaganza with someone other then the strangers with me in the cinema.Great storyline, great special effects, great action, some comedy and soul. This film has it all and it's for everyone.

A lot of super hero,occasionally physics defying, action ensues as the team is brought together as well as some well placed humor.Marvel Studios will have a hard task improving on this and already my 11 year old wants to see it again.

2012-11-19,"Do you know what is better than one super heroes defeat a few enemies? No well I will tell you, a group a super heroes defeating thousands of enemies, that is why The Avengers is such a great movie. It is also amazing because it is the greatest team of super heroes every assembled, not just by Marvel but, all comics every created. This movie had a unique way to tell the back stories of the heroes, instead of just cramming all that information into a small part of the movie and making so you only got part of the story instead, they made prequel movies for each of the heroes expect for Hawkeyes which his back story was in Thor, Nick Fury which back story was in both Thor and Iron Man and Black Window which her back story was in the Iron man movies.This movie is what comic book fans have been waiting for, for years, finally a movie with Marvel's greatest heroes Captain America, the Hulk, Black Window, Hawkeyes, Iron Man, Thor, even Nick Fury is there to lead S.H.I.E.L.D and almost forgot about Loki which makes appearance as the bad guy like always. Not only does this movie have greatest possible actors playing super heroes like Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, it has awesome special effects. Also this movie has great action scenes in fact, most of the two and half hour movie is action but, along with the action there is a lot of humor all throughout the film. This movie is possibly the best super hero of all-time best because of the perfect mixture of humor and action that all movies should have.Even though the movie is two and half hours long which is a pretty long for a movie but, it never seems like you are seating and watching the movie for ten minutes because it is so action, humor and suspension. If you compare this movie to any other super heroes movie, it makes them look bad because of the great job the Directed Joss Whedon did on the movie mixed with the brininess of Stan Lee the creator of the comic books making it a great movie for people of all ages. Also the studio said they were going to make another one a few days after it came out so, I am not the only one who thinks this movie was great.",10.0,2012-11,Monday,"about:0.03, action:0.11, actors:0.04, after:0.04, all:0.11, almost:0.05, along:0.05, also:0.09, always:0.04, am:0.04, amazing:0.04, america:0.03, and:0.13, another:0.04, any:0.03, are:0.02, as:0.04, avengers:0.02, awesome:0.04, back:0.17, bad:0.08, because:0.13, been:0.03, best:0.06, better:0.03, black:0.07, book:0.04, both:0.05, but:0.06, by:0.03, came:0.05, captain:0.03, comic:0.06, comics:0.04, did:0.03, do:0.03, does:0.04, downey:0.03, each:0.03, effects:0.03, even:0.06, every:0.07, expect:0.05, fact:0.05, fans:0.04, few:0.08, film:0.02, finally:0.05, for:0.13, fury:0.08, going:0.04, got:0.04, great:0.13, greatest:0.17, group:0.05, guy:0.05, had:0.03, half:0.10, has:0.05, have:0.06, her:0.05, hero:0.04, heroes:0.26, his:0.03, hour:0.05, hours:0.05, hulk:0.02, humor:0.12, if:0.03, in:0.07, instead:0.11, into:0.03, iron:0.10, is:0.21, it:0.12, job:0.04, joss:0.03, jr:0.03, just:0.05, know:0.04, like:0.07, loki:0.03, long:0.08, look:0.05, lot:0.04, made:0.03, make:0.03, makes:0.08, making:0.09, man:0.10, marvel:0.05, minutes:0.05, most:0.03, movie:0.29, movies:0.08, never:0.04, nick:0.08, no:0.03, not:0.06, of:0.24, on:0.02, one:0.06, only:0.09, other:0.03, out:0.03, part:0.08, people:0.04, perfect:0.04, pretty:0.04, robert:0.03, said:0.05, scenes:0.03, seems:0.05, should:0.04, so:0.07, special:0.04, story:0.11, such:0.04, super:0.22, team:0.04, than:0.03, that:0.05, the:0.35, them:0.03, there:0.05, they:0.05, this:0.11, thor:0.08, though:0.04, throughout:0.05, time:0.03, to:0.06, two:0.08, was:0.08, watching:0.04, way:0.03, well:0.03, were:0.03, what:0.05, whedon:0.03, which:0.16, who:0.03, why:0.04, will:0.03, with:0.06, years:0.04, you:0.11"
2012-05-05,"The Avengers is a fan's dream come true. Five years fives films and the most incredible build up in film history leading to this the most ambition filled film ever. It could've fallen flat on it's face. But the film makers who made it clearly love the heroes involved and wanted to show it in terms of story and character development. Joss Whedon takes his time in letting the film unwind and he let's action show up when it's needed. The Action stunts and CGI all take a backseat to the story and acting which is great. Whedon lets the characters speak for themselves and let's the story develop at it's own pace. Which is important because all of that leads to the incredible action packed climax. The interaction between the heroes shows them bonding and feeling each other out as well as rising to the menace which leads to the formation of the Avengers. The story ties up dangling plot lines from the other Marvel films and comes up with a plot that demands the Avengers. S.H.I.E.L.D is experimenting with the tesseract a cube of awesome power when Loki Thor's half brother enters our world and after a battle with Nick Fury and his forces Loki takes the tesseract and leaves taking with him some converts. His plan is to use the Tesseract to open a gateway to let a hostile alien force invade Earth and once Earth is taken down he will step in and Rule it. Nick Fury quickly puts the Avengers plan into action and calls forth Captain America,Iron Man,The Black Widow,Thor, And The Hulk to help find Loki and to battle whatever Evil he is about to unleash. Some bumpy moments happen along the way until they finally form as a team with Hawkeye lending a hand. If You're a comic book fan this is a supreme moment of triumph for you. If you're not then this film will be another one in a long line of action films based on a comic book that's worth seeing.",10.0,2012-05,Saturday,"about:0.04, acting:0.05, action:0.14, after:0.04, alien:0.06, all:0.05, along:0.06, america:0.03, and:0.30, another:0.05, as:0.08, at:0.03, avengers:0.10, awesome:0.05, battle:0.10, be:0.03, because:0.04, between:0.05, black:0.04, book:0.09, brother:0.06, but:0.02, captain:0.03, cgi:0.05, character:0.04, characters:0.03, come:0.05, comes:0.06, comic:0.08, could:0.04, development:0.06, down:0.05, each:0.04, earth:0.10, ever:0.04, evil:0.06, face:0.07, fan:0.10, film:0.14, films:0.12, finally:0.06, find:0.06, for:0.05, from:0.03, fury:0.09, great:0.03, half:0.06, hawkeye:0.04, he:0.10, help:0.07, heroes:0.08, him:0.05, his:0.11, hulk:0.03, if:0.07, in:0.10, incredible:0.10, into:0.04, iron:0.03, is:0.16, it:0.13, joss:0.04, let:0.18, line:0.06, lines:0.06, loki:0.11, long:0.05, love:0.05, made:0.04, man:0.03, marvel:0.03, moment:0.06, moments:0.05, most:0.08, nick:0.09, not:0.03, of:0.11, on:0.06, once:0.06, one:0.03, other:0.07, our:0.06, out:0.03, own:0.05, packed:0.06, plot:0.09, power:0.06, re:0.11, seeing:0.06, show:0.11, some:0.07, story:0.14, take:0.05, takes:0.13, team:0.04, tesseract:0.20, that:0.06, the:0.45, them:0.04, then:0.05, they:0.03, this:0.06, thor:0.06, time:0.03, to:0.22, true:0.06, until:0.06, up:0.13, ve:0.05, way:0.04, well:0.03, whedon:0.08, when:0.07, which:0.11, who:0.04, widow:0.04, will:0.07, with:0.12, world:0.05, worth:0.05, years:0.05, you:0.08"

Speaking of 3D effect their's no doubt its one of the best after likes of Avatar and Tintin... Now talking about the storyline well it isn't something special just same old story but the execution makes it a different experience. Mark Ruffalo as HULK was incredible and no need to say about Iron Man (the coolest superhero of all). I liked the verbal fight between Iron Man and Capt.America....

2017-05-11,"Everything that the Marvel Cinematic Universe was culminating to leads up to this. And it certainly doesn't disappoint. Except story-wise.What made the previous Marvel films compelling was how they managed to write a unique and realistic story that became the primary focus of the films rather than the overused hero-villain structure. Watching Tony Stark grow from arrogant billionaire to humbled hero, torn by war. Watching Bruce Banner suffer with his internal Jekyll-Hyde in a modern society. Watching Thor Odinson learn from Earth and become humbled. And finally seeing Captain America use his sense of duty to the US to cope with his new superhuman powers. The MCU films' most attractive feature, in my opinion, was the storyline.I felt Marvel's The Avengers strayed from the character-driven storyline. The main conflict and growth in the film is getting the heroes to adjust their agendas as a team. But a majority of the film is also dedicated to the action, the one-line jokes, and the special effects spectacles that take up at least a third of the film. With The Avengers, we get a fun movie that diminishes the realistic take on heroes that the previous MCU films employed and puts more emphasis on the comedy and epic spectacle that is the film. There's much less room for the typical character development and storyline that we came to love through the MCU. While it's amazing to see these heroes finally come together on the same screen and work as a beautiful team, the story falls flat to a basic heroes-fight-villain structure.",6.0,2017-05,Thursday,"action:0.03, also:0.04, amazing:0.05, america:0.04, and:0.20, as:0.06, at:0.04, avengers:0.06, banner:0.05, become:0.08, bruce:0.06, but:0.03, by:0.04, came:0.07, captain:0.04, certainly:0.08, character:0.08, cinematic:0.07, come:0.05, comedy:0.07, development:0.07, doesn:0.06, earth:0.06, effects:0.04, epic:0.07, everything:0.06, felt:0.06, fight:0.06, film:0.13, films:0.19, finally:0.13, for:0.03, from:0.10, fun:0.05, get:0.04, getting:0.07, hero:0.11, heroes:0.18, his:0.12, how:0.05, in:0.07, is:0.07, it:0.04, least:0.07, less:0.07, line:0.07, love:0.06, made:0.04, main:0.06, marvel:0.11, mcu:0.22, more:0.04, most:0.04, movie:0.02, much:0.04, my:0.04, new:0.05, of:0.08, on:0.09, one:0.03, opinion:0.07, powers:0.08, previous:0.13, rather:0.08, same:0.06, screen:0.05, see:0.04, seeing:0.06, sense:0.07, special:0.05, stark:0.06, story:0.12, storyline:0.22, take:0.12, team:0.10, than:0.04, that:0.17, the:0.53, their:0.04, there:0.04, these:0.05, they:0.03, this:0.02, thor:0.04, through:0.06, to:0.23, together:0.04, tony:0.06, universe:0.07, up:0.08, us:0.06, villain:0.11, was:0.08, watching:0.16, we:0.09, what:0.04, while:0.06, with:0.08, work:0.06"

My favourite Avengers were definitely the Hulk(the way he 'hulks out' during the climax is pretty awesome)... and Hawkeye(who knew shooting arrows could look so cool??)

2012-05-04,"First of all I will not be referring to this film by the crap UK name of Avengers Assembled. The film is The Avengers and that all it needs to be called.This is biggest and most anticipated film from the last few years. It is a sequel to the Marvel films Iron Man (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2011), Captain America (2011) and The Incredible Hulk (2008). But is it possible to make one film starring them all? Would it work with all of them in lead roles? The film brings together Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans) & The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) along with S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). They join forces against Thor's Brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who has unleashed an alien race upon the Earth so he can conquer it.As many of you will know by now, I am a huge action movie and comic adaption fan, so this film exactly what I was looking for. I kept away from many reviews and possible spoilers. However I had to see the trailers. After seeing them and being blown away I got a little worried for the film. Many trailers use so much of the action and plot that they show most of the good parts of the film. I really hoped that this wouldn't happen with this one. I wanted this film to be good.After the first 5 minutes I was worried. The film started out well but there was a really really bad camera cut/edit. For a film fan it stood out and slapped me in the face. I started to worry that it was a sign of things to come. However my fears were soon dispelled as the film sucked me in with outstanding direction, visuals and 3D effects like I have never seen before. The way the film was prepared starting out with Iron Man in 2008 and then tying in all the following films together are a big lead up to this one. A huge gamble but it really paid off. The outstanding cast work so well together. With all these larger than life characters already having their own individual stories told, all what was left was to bring them together. But first they start out against each other. Their individual egos explode as they battle each other with explosive devastation. Soon they all share a common goal and start to band together. Then the film really lets to. Up until this point it was amazing. When they finally start working together that's when an amazing movie exceeds all expectations and takes the superhero genre to a level never before seen. This is also the point then the 3D effects take on a whole new level. Prior to this they were used for depth and clarity of the film very well, but now it bring you in to the film and doesn't let go. The greatest effect is an alien ship appearing from over your head. It actually startled me as it appeared above my head before it was on the screen. Never before outside of a theme park has a 3D film managed this.Fortunately it didn't just meet my expectations, it exceeded them more than I ever thought possible. I really can't find the right words to convey how good this film really is. It has moments where you laugh so hard you cry, amazingly the best of these involve The Hulk! There are moments where you find yourself holding your breath at the sheer scope of what you are seeing. The action raises the bar for the genre to maybe unattainable heights. This film is so very good.I usually rate films on a scale of 1-10 but 10 feels inadequate for this. So for this one I am using 1-100. This film scores a 99. Only losing out on 100 due to the single bad edit at the start of the film. Joss Whedon has managed the impossible with this film and pulled of a film no one expected to be so good. For this reason and for the first time my stand out performance is the director Joss Whedon, for creating a perfect superhero movie.You have to see this on the biggest screen you can find and in 3D",10.0,2012-05,Friday,"10:0.05, 3d:0.12, action:0.04, actually:0.03, after:0.05, against:0.07, alien:0.06, all:0.12, along:0.03, already:0.03, also:0.02, am:0.06, amazing:0.05, america:0.04, an:0.05, and:0.18, are:0.04, as:0.06, at:0.03, avengers:0.03, away:0.07, bad:0.05, battle:0.03, be:0.06, before:0.11, being:0.02, best:0.02, big:0.02, biggest:0.07, black:0.02, bring:0.07, brings:0.03, brother:0.03, but:0.08, by:0.04, can:0.05, captain:0.04, cast:0.03, characters:0.02, chris:0.05, come:0.02, comic:0.02, depth:0.04, didn:0.03, director:0.03, doesn:0.03, downey:0.02, each:0.04, earth:0.03, effects:0.04, evans:0.03, ever:0.02, expectations:0.06, expected:0.03, face:0.04, fan:0.05, feels:0.03, few:0.03, film:0.36, films:0.07, finally:0.03, find:0.10, first:0.08, for:0.12, from:0.05, fury:0.03, genre:0.07, go:0.02, good:0.08, got:0.03, greatest:0.04, had:0.02, hard:0.03, has:0.07, have:0.03, having:0.03, hawkeye:0.02, he:0.02, hemsworth:0.03, hiddleston:0.03, how:0.02, however:0.06, huge:0.06, hulk:0.05, in:0.08, incredible:0.03, individual:0.07, iron:0.07, is:0.10, it:0.17, jackson:0.03, jeremy:0.03, johansson:0.03, joss:0.04, jr:0.02, just:0.02, know:0.02, last:0.03, left:0.04, let:0.03, life:0.03, like:0.02, little:0.03, loki:0.02, looking:0.03, make:0.02, man:0.07, many:0.07, mark:0.02, marvel:0.02, maybe:0.03, me:0.06, minutes:0.03, moments:0.06, more:0.02, most:0.04, movie:0.03, much:0.02, my:0.07, never:0.08, new:0.03, nick:0.03, no:0.02, not:0.01, now:0.05, of:0.15, off:0.03, on:0.08, one:0.07, only:0.02, other:0.04, out:0.11, over:0.02, own:0.03, parts:0.04, perfect:0.03, performance:0.03, plot:0.02, point:0.06, really:0.13, reason:0.03, renner:0.03, reviews:0.04, right:0.03, robert:0.02, ruffalo:0.02, samuel:0.03, scarlett:0.03, screen:0.05, see:0.04, seeing:0.06, seen:0.05, sequel:0.03, show:0.03, single:0.04, so:0.13, stand:0.04, start:0.13, superhero:0.04, take:0.03, takes:0.03, than:0.04, that:0.06, the:0.42, their:0.04, them:0.10, then:0.07, there:0.03, these:0.05, they:0.12, things:0.03, this:0.20, thor:0.05, thought:0.03, time:0.02, to:0.20, together:0.12, tom:0.03, until:0.04, up:0.04, used:0.04, very:0.04, was:0.12, way:0.02, well:0.05, were:0.04, what:0.05, whedon:0.04, when:0.04, where:0.05, who:0.02, whole:0.03, widow:0.02, will:0.04, with:0.10, work:0.05, would:0.02, years:0.03, you:0.12, your:0.05"

He is a great story teller and there was no dull moments at all. Loved the humor in it and all characters bounced off each other extremely well. They were all equal parts instead of having a main character and the others as supporting.Will definitely be buying another ticket to see it next weekend again.Mark Ruffalos Hulk was the best I have seen.

2012-05-11,"After setting it up with multiple films about how the individual characters gained their super powers, The Avengers finally brings together all of the heroes in one story to either work together as team to defend Earth or fight amongst each other aided by their massive egos and verbal bravado. Perhaps never before in cinema history have there been so many movies released as prequels to set up the eventual crown jewel. Batman and Superman only met in the comics, not on the big screen. The Avengers appears to be sort of a test case to see if so many leading superheroes can all share the same screen.While all six characters each receive a certain amount of on screen time and side story, some are pushed more into the foreground than others. As Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is a fan favorite and is always handy with a funny quip, he is front and center along with Captain America (Chris Evans) who even though does not have much of a super power, places himself in a sort of leadership role within the group. Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and the two characters that did not get their own films, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) all fight for the leftover screen time in the background. The puppet master is Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who spends most of his effort in sheep dog mode herding these guys from their billion dollar towers or their self-imposed exile.So what possible threat is great enough to require the efforts of six superheroes? Eh, it's just Loki (Tom HIddleston); Thor's adopted brother who has a chip on his shoulder. He zooms down to Earth with greasy hair, a ridiculous hat, and the backing of a large and formidable alien Army known as The Chitauri. Countering Loki would seem like a job for just Thor or just Iron Man, not the catalyst for The Avengers to finally come together as a team. Ah, but here is where the film really takes off. Most of these super beings are not team players. Iron Man's ego is way too big to share space with somebody else, the Hulk does not trust himself to walk down the street, and Captain America can't believe these prima donnas represent the future America which remains quite strange to him. Entrusted with helming this new and star-studded film is Joss Whedon, the brains behind Firefly, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Angel. He has only directed one movie before this, the wonderful Serenity. I would have guessed the studio would go with a more experienced director; however, Whedon has proved before he is more than capable with this type of material. I'm not talking about action movies, but the verbal sparring, witty conversational scenes, and complicated story which must make a lot of room for almost too many characters. Whedon brings his trademark strengths with him including humor. When you think of The Hulk, the words humor and ironic laughter do not pop up in the first 20 adjectives to describe him, but in The Avengers, The Hulk becomes the most amusing character to watch which is all due to Whedon's skill. There are a few details which do not work as well as others which hurt the film's appeal a little bit. To bring The Avengers together and mold them as a team requires a tremendous villain; however, Loki is not that guy. He is more of a villain's sidekick or henchman rather than the main baddie. Then there is Nick Fury's helicarrier which can also cloak itself and appears to be an upgrade, but direct rip-off of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. Oh, and Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill was the absolute wrong casting choice for her role. An unknown actress is always better for a supporting role because every time she was on screen, all I could see was Robin from How I Met Your Mother. Those are just details though. Whedon shows he was able to weave together a complex sextet of superheroes and take them through the difficult process of becoming a team. For simplicity's sake, some heroes are featured much more than others, but any other script and director would have made the same choices. The Avengers is very good during its climactic fight scene where all of the plot threads come together, but Loki as the villain is just not up to the challenge.

2012-05-01,"7.6 For Non-Comic Book Fanatics. Although there are plenty of fantastical elements in this movie, this movie is an enjoyment. Although everyone who enjoys this movie will need to be willing to accept the fantastical elements of the characters and main plot points, this movie is successful because it is logical and reasonable beyond those openly accepted fantastical characters. The action is exciting, imaginative and well shown. But the greatest strength of the movie was the development of the characters. We didn't need to know the comic book facts about the characters to understand what was happening. Moreover, the characters had personality: they were reasonably complex and interacted with enough pressure against each other to understand them as more than just ""cardboard"" comic book cut-outs. The highlight was the humoristic quips between the heroes. I recommend that you see this in the cinema in the 3-D version, as the 3-D is done well and not the over-the-top 3-D of yester-years.

2022-11-19,The Avengers is entertaining because how over the top it is. If you can forgive all the plot conveniences and unrealistic scenarios then you'll enjoy the film. I quite enjoy turning my brain off and watching some silly and mindless fun. The cast and the superheroes they play are charismatic and larger than life which is what makes this film a joyride. There are no deep storylines or conundrums in this film. Instead there are monsters and explosions. Marvel has done well by including a good dose of humour to make this a light hearted and enjoyable feature.

After watching The Avengers, I'm thoroughly satisfied and I can guarantee that this film is the best of those movies I mentioned. Every moment of this film is quite enjoyable. I liked every dialog of Robert (Iron Man). Actions are elegant. Everything seemed perfect. One thing I'd like to mention that in this movie, I missed Edward Norton as the character of Hulk.

I've become abundantly aware that there are legions of fans out there who can't wait to see what Hollywood is doing with the classic comic book characters. But after three Iron Men and now this, I see a sameness in them all, and I'm not equipped properly to enjoy them as I should. I'm still rating this pretty high because it is amazing to look at, the special effects are beyond belief, and some of the characters have some dimension. That said, I think I would need a manual to really get the true impact of each character, what his or her powers are, and how they fit together. There is always some evildoing bad guy who has some history with the others. This is what makes comics what they are (I read lots of comics as a kid, so I do understand the milieu). When you get right down to it, however, they seem to rely mostly on beating each other over the head with whatever is handy. It's like watching professional wrestling which is sort of comic bookish in its own way. It's a cast of characters what represent simple things, both good and evil.

Its starts off with a bang with Loki making a nice appearance and just carries on from there. The best part of the film comes in its last 1 hour. The actions sequences, the graphics and the spot comedy by the actors is superb. True credit to the director for making enough screen space for all the characters who have performed brilliantly. Special mention about Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.)and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), outstanding performance by both of them. Now coming to the storyline, its simple. Loki wants to conquer earth and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles a team 'The Avengers' to stop the invasion. All the characters have their own special part to play in the film n they carried it out flawlessly. As i said before, the special feature of this film is its action sequences.

2015-04-18,"Okay Avengers is good. The dialogue is witty and the action is action. Not a movie so much around telling a story as it is telling jokes. I like that style. But going by the director, Joss Whedon's, quote, ""Make it dark, make it grim, make it tough but for the love of God tell a joke."" Well, you got that last part right. But where's the build up? And I'm not talking about the boring beginning.I guess I just feel like the characters got to wisecrack each other but they didn't really demonstrate that they ""got"" each other. I feel like I'm missing something. We didn't get that one moment that was serious, something that I feel like Joss said himself was important to the build up.As I said, I find the beginning to be rather boring. It doesn't grab me with a defining character moment. I don't feel like Avengers is one of the great movies. I don't even feel like it's the best of the series. They did better in The Winter Soldier. They did a better ensemble in Guardians of the Galaxy. It wasn't as passionate as Spider-Man 2. It doesn't compare to the writing of The Dark Knight.They built up to this film with five other character flicks which, I guess, is the reason why this works. I just feel like something more meaningful could been done. I feel like we could have seen how the characters relate to each other. Guardians of the Galaxy could be accused of having the same problem but I feel like they at least joked about relating. Avengers doesn't do that. Hawkeye is there and he does nothing. Iron Man attempts a sacrifice and we don't feel much. Cap is there and he doesn't offer as much American spirit as he could. Thor has some good remarks. Black Widow is hot and... badass.

2012-05-14,"As someone who had kind off lost faith in where this ""Marvel superhero"" series was going, I've got to admit to being pleasantly surprised by ""The Avengers."" I Suppose I shouldn't be. All the other movies (especially the lame ""Captain America"") main purpose was to lead up too this. So off course this was always going to be the biggest event, and most well organised flick.Movie sees Iron man, Captain America, Thor and the Hulk thrown together too battle the bad guy from ""Thor,"" who's managed to get his hands on the weapon from ""Captain America."" Right? ..... It is a bit hard to follow at first if your not a die-hard fan off the previous movies. But once it gets going, every character is served well, and the action is imaginative and non-stop.""The Avengers"" is also pretty damn funny. Robert Downey Jnr is his usual wise cracking self. But unlike in the ""Iron man"" movies, the humour is perfectly balanced with the action. Thor and Captain America don't seem as lame as they were in their own movies, and my personal favourite Hulk, is still the greatest, and is played almost better than in previous versions here by Mark Ruffalo.The Only minor problem I have with the movie is that everyone seems just as indestructible as each other. I mean, isn't Hulk suppose to be the only ""unstoppable"" force? Seems even Scarlett Johansson as the powerless Black Widow is unstoppable. Still, I'd go as far as saying ""The Avengers"" is maybe even the best Superhero movie ever. Its refreshing too see as many characters as this thrown together successfully.

2014-03-28,"In Joss Whedon's ""The Avengers,"" three Marvel Comics superheroes - Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans) and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) - are recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. to do battle against Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), who has come to Earth with an alien army to claim the world for his own. But can three such distinctly talented yet strong-willed individuals put aside their differences and egos long enough to function as a team - as the Avengers - to save the planet? There's no question that gathering three classic superheroes into a single film was a stroke of marketing genius, as well as a considerable treat for fans. The movie itself is lively, loud, and epic in scale with just enough character delineation to keep us engaged on a human level. Plus, it culminates in a spectacular jamboree of destruction in New York City that turns into a veritable Valhalla for CGI aficionados.All the above-mentioned actors enter into the spirit of the enterprise, as do Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Clark Gregg, Samuel L.

2012-05-10,"Deceived by the praise and high ratings this movie received here I decided to watch it, even though I didn't like Thor, couldn't sit through the propaganda that was Captain America, and thought that both of the Ironmen were only average. The movie is just fighting, explosions, destruction to infinity, and the action isn't anything that you haven't seen before. There is just more of it, which doesn't make it better - it just makes it become boring and repetitive really fast. Scattered amongst those are retarded dialogs and stupid one-liners, seasoned with terrible acting and corny motivational speeches in the vein of ""God bless America, and make the rest of the world (or rather Universe) its colony."" Samuel L. Jackson was unbelievably terrible, Scarlett Johansson was terrible, and was that Sherlock Holmes wearing a suit of armor? I could have sworn that the character was the same, only the name was different. So much for Robert Downey's versatility. The rest of the cast followed suit. The only decent actor in this movie was Tom Hiddleston , but his character was ruined by the writers. Loki is supposed to be a god, but here he is so mediocre, that it is ridiculous. His ""mighty"" spear is nothing more than a very low grade laser gun, which doubles as a mind control tool that doesn't work all of the time, and when it does work, it does not work all that well. The mighty, fearsome aliens turn out to be mere cannon fodder, dropping like mosquitoes. Characters' level of strength and power changes throughout the movie to suit the need of the moment. There are 2 (yes, TWO) funny scenes, and both include the Hulk beating up people. That should give you an idea about the quality of the funny parts of the movie. I guess to like this one you would either have to be a die hard fan of the Avengers, or a die hard fan of mindless, repetitive, boring action.

2023-12-23,"""Avengers"" delivers adventure, action and great momentum, but unfortunately doesn't offer everything audiences might expect. With a rating of 6/10, we are presented with a film that has its merits, but also some flaws.One of the main positives is undoubtedly the stellar cast line-up. The combination of iconic characters such as Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and Hulk into one superhero team is visually stunning and brings a lot of joy to fans of comic book worlds. Each of the heroes brings their own character and style, giving the film a wide variety of personalities.However, despite this exceptional cast of characters, some parts of the story feel superficial and underdeveloped. Some moments feel more like cursory scene connections than a coherent and deep narrative. This lack of coherence may discourage viewers from fully immersing themselves in the plot.The 6/10 rating also reflects some of the technical aspects of the film. While the visual effects are impressive, occasional lapses in animation can give the impression of sloppiness. The music and sound effects, while well executed, sometimes come across as too epic, losing subtlety and nuance at certain key moments.Overall, 'The Avengers' can be considered an entertaining blockbuster that is sure to find its fans. However, with a 6/10 rating, it falls short of the full potential it could offer. It's an engaging spectacle, but it also struggles with certain flaws that prevent it from being fully engaging and leave room for improvement in future sequels.",6.0,2023-12,Saturday,"10:0.19, action:0.04, also:0.16, america:0.05, an:0.08, and:0.22, are:0.07, as:0.07, at:0.04, avengers:0.07, be:0.04, being:0.06, blockbuster:0.08, book:0.06, brings:0.17, but:0.09, can:0.09, captain:0.05, cast:0.13, character:0.05, characters:0.08, come:0.06, comic:0.05, could:0.06, doesn:0.07, each:0.06, effects:0.11, entertaining:0.07, epic:0.08, everything:0.07, expect:0.08, fans:0.14, feel:0.14, film:0.12, find:0.08, for:0.03, from:0.08, full:0.08, give:0.07, giving:0.09, great:0.04, has:0.04, heroes:0.05, however:0.15, hulk:0.04, impressive:0.09, in:0.08, into:0.06, iron:0.04, is:0.08, it:0.13, its:0.11, like:0.04, line:0.08, lot:0.06, main:0.08, man:0.04, may:0.08, might:0.08, moments:0.14, more:0.04, of:0.35, one:0.07, overall:0.07, own:0.07, parts:0.09, plot:0.06, rating:0.27, scene:0.07, short:0.09, some:0.19, story:0.05, such:0.07, superhero:0.05, sure:0.07, team:0.06, than:0.05, that:0.09, the:0.36, their:0.05, this:0.05, thor:0.04, to:0.05, too:0.06, up:0.05, visual:0.08, we:0.06, well:0.05, while:0.14, with:0.13"
2012-04-29,"Before the film had even came out in cinema's, I knew I would like it, but when I saw it. Even I was just intrigued and astounded at literally how good this film actually was. From the beginning of the movie, you are pulled straight into the story and the action and it continuous throughout the movie. The comedy sections pull in really well, as they are not constant and most of the time you do not expect the comedy to occur.Each character within the movie brings something to the entire thing, I felt for each character, pulled into their whole situation.

2024-11-01,"It's hard to imagine how complicated it was to make 5 or more character storylines meld together cohesively. As much as this movie succeeds, it needs to a lot of juggling to keep the wheels turning in this large large movie. The same could be said for the recent ""John Carter"", where multiple storylines created a lot extra running time. The biggest problem is that there comes a point where there is so much going on that you no longer care about what's happening. Leave it to proper character development by releasing entire tentpole films for each superhero involved before putting out the group feature. But the other necessary element is not only our superfriends, but something new. That's where they wisely let Captain America become the New Kid on the Block, and he eventually takes charge. But the real buzz comes from the latest actor to be David Banner/Hulk, Mark Ruffalo. He is obviously a higher caliber actor than the rest of the bunch, making him the most interesting character by far. Too bad he has little screen time. One thing oddly more convincing with Ruffalo this go-round is that he has a face that looks like Hulk (if that can be seen as a compliment).As for the villain, to tell you the truth my least favourite of the Avengers was Thor. The whole mythology behind Loki works OK but his persona doesn't evoke ultimate evil like some other villains. I guess I like my superheros a little more modern. I actually liked Tony Stark better this time around than his activities in ""Ironman 3"", and helps prevent the movie from going into cliche territory. Captain America also keeps a level head, rendering Nick Fury pretty much irrelevant. He is the weakest part of the movie, and seems relegated to talking to an anonymous ""council"". My favourite character actually was Black Widow. I find Scarlett Johansen a worthy Angelina Jolie protege, and has some of the best moments in the script.The action sequences succeed, but rarely exceed expectations. I enjoyed the floating aircraft carrier, even though ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" had the idea first. ""Dark Knight"" for example had more effective action sequences. Yet there is great amount of charisma and momentum to justify it's extended running time. I still had fun and felt an emotional tug here and there, and laughed in other places. The audience in the theatre I was in applauded at the end. The music by Alan Sylvestri was not memorable, his style is more sedate than other composers, but the hero moments were boosted by the grand sounding score. The special effects were numerous. Whether they were groundbreaking wasn't readily apparent, but their contribution to many of the action set pieces were appropriate.",7.0,2024-11,Friday,"about:0.03, action:0.07, actor:0.11, actually:0.10, also:0.03, america:0.06, amount:0.06, an:0.05, and:0.14, around:0.05, as:0.09, at:0.03, audience:0.05, avengers:0.02, bad:0.04, banner:0.04, be:0.07, become:0.06, before:0.04, best:0.03, better:0.04, biggest:0.06, black:0.04, but:0.14, by:0.12, can:0.03, captain:0.09, care:0.06, character:0.13, comes:0.10, could:0.04, dark:0.05, development:0.05, doesn:0.05, each:0.04, effects:0.04, end:0.04, enjoyed:0.05, entire:0.06, even:0.03, evil:0.05, expectations:0.05, face:0.06, far:0.05, felt:0.05, films:0.04, find:0.05, first:0.03, for:0.08, from:0.05, fun:0.04, fury:0.04, go:0.04, going:0.09, great:0.03, group:0.06, had:0.10, hard:0.05, has:0.09, he:0.15, here:0.04, hero:0.04, him:0.04, his:0.10, how:0.04, hulk:0.05, idea:0.06, if:0.03, in:0.11, interesting:0.05, into:0.04, is:0.14, it:0.09, keep:0.06, knight:0.05, least:0.05, let:0.05, like:0.08, liked:0.06, little:0.09, loki:0.03, looks:0.06, lot:0.08, make:0.04, making:0.05, many:0.04, mark:0.04, moments:0.09, more:0.15, most:0.03, movie:0.08, much:0.10, my:0.09, new:0.09, nick:0.04, no:0.03, not:0.05, of:0.13, on:0.05, one:0.02, only:0.03, or:0.03, other:0.13, our:0.06, out:0.03, part:0.05, point:0.05, pretty:0.05, real:0.05, rest:0.05, ruffalo:0.07, said:0.05, same:0.05, scarlett:0.04, screen:0.04, script:0.05, seems:0.05, seen:0.04, sequences:0.10, set:0.05, so:0.03, some:0.06, something:0.04, special:0.04, stark:0.04, still:0.04, superhero:0.03, takes:0.06, than:0.10, that:0.12, the:0.53, their:0.03, there:0.11, they:0.05, thing:0.04, this:0.07, thor:0.03, though:0.05, time:0.11, to:0.18, together:0.03, tony:0.05, too:0.04, villain:0.04, was:0.11, wasn:0.05, were:0.13, what:0.03, where:0.13, whole:0.05, widow:0.04, with:0.02, world:0.04, yet:0.05, you:0.05"
2012-05-04,"With five previous Marvel movies building up to this, it has a lot to live up to. And boy does it deliver on every level. This movie is the definition of a popcorn blockbuster. The last time I had this much fun watching a marvel movie was Iron Man. But Iron man can now step back and crawl under the shadow of the awesome Avengers.I'll Start off by saying that almost all of the credit should go to Joss Whedon for his superb talent in writing and directing an all-star ensemble like this. His previous movie Serenity showed that he has a niche for cleverly directing an ensemble, and The Avengers only concretes his skill. Every super hero and spy in this movie gets their screen time.As most would come to expect Robert delivers the most witty lines and laughs as Iron Man, but for me, Mark Ruffalo and his angry counterpart stole the show. As Bruce Banner, he has charm and a lot of heart. As the Hulk, he had the the whole theater clapping and laughing, and wanting more. Finally, we have a great Hulk. The rest of the cast and characters get their dues as you would expect and deliver a ton of fun. Michael Bay, take note from the new king of the blockbuster. The Avengers lives up to the hype, wait, it blows the hype out of the water. It's That good. I just want more Avengers please!Oh, and stay for the credits.

2012-04-30,"I've seen the inflated review aggregate, and at the risk of being dismissed a contrarian, I seriously disagree with the accolades. The Avengers movie I saw contained no character development whatsoever; no character starts off ignorant, growing to enlightenment, or overcomes cowardice to become a hero, or any other example of behavioral character arcs. By the end, they are as they begun, unchanged, and definitively two-dimensional. The lack of character development is compounded by uninteresting, witless, filler dialogue (despite a few one-liners which managed to draw a giggle), with Dr. Stark and Dr. Banner, i.e. the alter egos of Iron-man and the Hulk, occasionally foraying into esoteric scientific jibber-jabber, that only served to bore me even more. In saying that, Downey Jr's, Tony Stark was the only mildly interesting and amusing character in the entire piece; the rest of the characters I couldn't give a shite about, despite liking them in their stand-alone movies. It seems Director Joss Whedon and pen pal, Zak Penn, are unaware of the law of diminishing returns, whereby the repetition of anything – in this case, fist-fights, and gun and super-power battles – eventually numbs to the point of indifference. Speaking of indifference, the limp-wristed, laughable, horn-wearing villain, Loki, was about as menacing as having a series of ping pong balls pitched at you. And the death of (no spoiler here) was about as emotionally moving as having your pet weevil larvae die. Effects-wise it seems despite the advances in CGI made by Avatar, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes, The Avengers decided to go retrograde, the Hulk looking nothing more than a three-dimensional cartoon, and likewise with Iron-Man and the endless stream of generic alien henchmen. The green-screen for the most part looked phony due to the artificial interior lighting illuminating the actor, mismatching the natural exterior light of the background – an Age-old problem that some directors don't seem to care about, however seriously it affects the suspension of disbelief. Anyway, enough of my moaning; if you like mindless-action with practically no story other than goodies versus baddies, and if you're a fan of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, you'll love this.",4.0,2012-04,Monday,"about:0.15, action:0.03, actor:0.06, alien:0.06, an:0.03, and:0.25, any:0.04, anything:0.06, are:0.06, as:0.13, at:0.07, avengers:0.05, banner:0.05, become:0.07, being:0.05, by:0.10, care:0.07, cgi:0.05, character:0.19, characters:0.03, couldn:0.07, development:0.12, dialogue:0.06, director:0.05, don:0.04, downey:0.04, effects:0.04, end:0.05, enough:0.05, entire:0.07, even:0.04, fan:0.05, few:0.05, for:0.02, give:0.05, go:0.05, having:0.12, here:0.05, hero:0.05, however:0.06, hulk:0.06, if:0.07, in:0.11, interesting:0.06, into:0.04, iron:0.07, is:0.02, it:0.06, joss:0.04, jr:0.04, like:0.03, ll:0.06, loki:0.04, looking:0.07, love:0.05, made:0.04, man:0.06, me:0.04, more:0.07, most:0.04, movie:0.02, movies:0.03, my:0.03, no:0.16, nothing:0.05, of:0.37, off:0.05, old:0.06, one:0.03, only:0.08, or:0.07, other:0.07, part:0.05, point:0.06, power:0.13, re:0.06, rest:0.06, review:0.06, saw:0.06, screen:0.05, seem:0.07, seems:0.13, seen:0.04, series:0.07, some:0.04, stand:0.07, stark:0.10, story:0.04, super:0.05, than:0.08, that:0.07, the:0.55, their:0.04, them:0.04, they:0.06, this:0.04, to:0.16, tony:0.05, two:0.05, ve:0.05, villain:0.05, was:0.08, whedon:0.04, which:0.04, with:0.10, you:0.11, your:0.05"

2012-05-12,"When I was 10 years old, my brother and I discovered the world of Comic Books - adamantium claws, mutant chromosomes, capes, tights, unique abilities that we imagined what we would do, if only we possessed them. How great it would be if we didn't have to visualize these heroes in our minds, but watch them in a live-action movie?With this movie, the dreams of geeks and nerds have been fulfilled in some sick and twisted yet wonderful manner, like the wet fantasies of normal people but magnified by the Nth power. It feels almost wrong to see Iron Man argue with Captain America, each capturing the essence of who they are supposed to be, in the flesh. How wonderful it is.Once you get past the awesome visual reality that is the Avengers, assembled, it's a delightful pleasure that the director or the screenwriters implemented several ""laugh out loud"" moments that were seamlessly woven into the flow of this movie. The Hulk, in particular, provides at least a couple of comic moments that had everyone in the theater roaring. It's not that we don't take this stuff seriously - we really do. It's great entertainment, and the box office results prove this. Yet, lest we forget, there is a bit of ridiculousness in this mish mash of a giant green monster, a man in red and blue tights, a modern-day bow and arrow archer, and so forth - and why confine entertainment to being one-dimensional spectacle and visual effects when you can select and choose from a true arsenal of gifts.",9.0,2012-05,Saturday,"10:0.06, action:0.04, almost:0.08, america:0.05, and:0.25, are:0.04, at:0.04, avengers:0.04, awesome:0.07, be:0.08, been:0.05, being:0.06, bit:0.07, brother:0.08, but:0.06, by:0.05, can:0.05, captain:0.05, comic:0.11, day:0.09, didn:0.07, director:0.07, do:0.11, don:0.05, each:0.06, effects:0.05, entertainment:0.18, everyone:0.07, feels:0.09, from:0.04, get:0.05, great:0.09, had:0.05, have:0.07, heroes:0.05, how:0.11, hulk:0.04, if:0.09, in:0.23, into:0.06, iron:0.04, is:0.08, it:0.16, least:0.08, like:0.04, man:0.08, moments:0.14, movie:0.09, my:0.05, not:0.04, of:0.23, old:0.08, once:0.08, one:0.04, only:0.05, or:0.05, our:0.09, out:0.04, past:0.09, people:0.06, power:0.09, really:0.05, see:0.05, so:0.04, some:0.05, stuff:0.09, take:0.07, that:0.18, the:0.34, theater:0.09, them:0.10, there:0.04, these:0.06, they:0.04, this:0.14, to:0.10, true:0.09, visual:0.17, was:0.03, watch:0.05, we:0.40, were:0.05, what:0.05, when:0.10, who:0.05, why:0.07, with:0.06, world:0.06, would:0.10, wrong:0.09, years:0.07, yet:0.16, you:0.07"
2012-05-26,"Tremendous hype surrounding a movie can be a very good thing. Usually it guarantees some big box office numbers for at least the opening weekend. But this is not always the case. The downside to so much hype around a movie is that many people tend to make up their minds before even setting foot in the theater. When this happens it takes a very well made movie to up peoples expectations. Three weeks ago one of the most hyped movies, if not the most hyped movie, of the year opened with The Avengers. Opening weekend in the US (it opened throughout the world the week before) broke every opening weekend recored, taking in $207 million. It would go on to make another $100 million in it's second weekend and cruise to $1 billion world wide in no time at all. This for all purposes, is a movie that lived up to the hype and more.I chose to let the hype die down before viewing the movie for review purposes, so as not to get caught up in everything BUT the movie. Yesterday was the day to view The Avengers and try not to get caught up in the Avenger storm.Based on the comic book which is a compilation of several different comic book characters, The Avengers is a secret team of superheroes put together should the world be on the brink of disaster. There wouldn't be much of a movie if the world didn't come to the brink of disaster when Thor's brother Loki comes to earth to obtain the most precious source of energy in the world known as the tesseract. When Loki controls the mind of some of S.H.I.E.L.D.s personnel to help with his sinister plot, director Nick Fury initiates the avengers program. After some difficult persuading the avengers do in fact come together. The movie climaxes with an epic battle throughout New York City.With the possibility of this movie being an epic failure, director Joss Whedon was very fortunate to have actors from each of their respective characters films, with the exception of The Hulk who had two different Bruce Banner's but was superbly cast with Mark Ruffalo. The talent and good acting by each person in their roles helped tremendously with the success of this film. With Robert Downey Jr. all but leading the cast as Iron Man/Tony Stark in a role he has really come to own, each one was exactly who was needed for their roles. The introduction of Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye was a great choice. He is on the rise in popularity and a fine actor in his own right.The story is not one that is complex and difficult to follow. It is almost the quintessential superhero story line that has every twist and close call we have come to know and love with these types of movies. Don't look for a surprise ending but also don't expect to be bored with a plot line that is too simple. The purpose of this movie is the effects and action and just seeing a lot of favorite superheroes together at once and Joss Whedon executes that perfectly.It is a fun exciting 2 1/2 hours and money well spent (for the 2D we did not see the 3D). It's everything everyone wants in a summer blockbuster movie. It is not hard to see why it is pulling in the money it is. It is just another case of giving the movie going audience what they want and making it well. There is still the possibility that all the records that The Avengers has set could be short lived come the end of July when Christopher Nolan unleashes his final installment in the Dark Knight series.

2012-05-07,"This is a very good movie. But 8.8 stars good? Not even close... and the main reason is the story which isn't that compelling. Rather it's pretty standard ""superhero has to save the world from an evil force"". The storyline has few surprises and is predictable.What brings this movie up to 7 stars on my meter is the execution of it, the dialogs, the acting, the jokes, and particularly the special effects. It's just outstanding.What is not so outstanding is that Scarlett Johansen and other non-super heroes are hiding behind yellow cabs with tiny guns. Their enemy? Monstrous Godzilla-like flying snake creatures that can knock over the Empire State building in a matter of seconds and which throws cars 100s of feet in the air and which couldn't care less about bullets. These non-super heroes magically survive and even contribute significantly to beat the monsters from outer space... without any injury whatsoever.It's kind of disappointing that so many reviewers, so far, are so emotional about this movie. It kind of reminds me about Dark Knight, another very good but way overrated movie.Who can honestly say that this movie is even in the same category as Shawshank, Godfather and Goodfellas and such.

2015-05-03,"Probably the most solidly structured movie I've ever seen. What I admire about The Avengers is that it doesn't go in guns blazing from the start, it doesn't open with the Avengers themselves but with Nick Fury and Maria Hill, who are there right at the beginning of what is eventually one of the best superhero movies ever, charged with explosive action, mind blowing spectacle and big laughs. When the world is threatened by Loki and his army of alien Chitauri, the Avengers Initiative is activated and a team of the most remarkable beings come together to save the world from obliteration. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye team up in one of the best movie finales to hit our screens, New York is a playground for jaw dropping action, stunning camera shots and immersive 3D, Joss Whedon's ability to balance out this enormous cast is unlike any other, and with whip smart writing and a powerhouse story this is the ultimate Marvel adventure.

2013-02-18,"I find it hard to believe that a film which was mostly made on a computer has such a high average rating. Does anyone care anymore that so little effort and imagination goes into film making? Avengers is 95% CGI, with a plot that is staggering in it's stupidity and unoriginality. Two of the so-called 'super-heroes' have no 'super' qualities at all - unless having funny coloured eyes and firing souped-up arrows or running around in a tight spandex suit showing lots of cleavage and pouting a lot qualify as super powers. All Black Widow does is what Emma Peel did 45 years ago - and half as well, i.e. kick ass. Even worse, the two best and most interesting Marvel characters, Iron Man and Hulk are reduced to mindless morons smashing their way through the enemy and without any attempt at the characterization that previous films did at least endeavour to give them. Every scene and plot twist is utterly predictable, the special effects are boring and the only thing to admire is Samuel L.

2012-05-23,"Let me preface by saying that I am no fan of superhero movies, whether they be from DC or Marvel. I find that their biggest failing is that they have long action sequences that become dull because you simply cannot identify very deeply with the characters involved. This is usually a result of poor character development and hackneyed dialog. The abysmal Transformers movies and Star Wars prequels come instantly to mind (my wife and I almost fell asleep during the opening scene of Revenge of the Sith during the long, boring space battle). Fighting and action need context to have an impact on the more discerning viewer. The 13-year old version of me probably would have enjoyed the aforementioned movies, at least a little bit, but 34-year old me would rather scrape sandpaper over my eyeballs than be subjected to a pointless visual assault.Now with the Avengers coming out, my wife and I decided that we should probably check it out for 2 reasons: Joss Whedon and Robert Downey Jr. When it comes to the superhero genre, Batman Begins and the first Iron Man sit at the top of our lists. Iron Man was funny, engaging and completely owned by Downey's personality. It was great fun and left the viewer with lasting thoughts and imagery. So with this being a Joss/Downey production for the most part (if you don't love at least some of Whedon's work, then you are not on my Christmas Card list), we were excited.We watched all of the prequels, hating Iron Man 2 and the Edward Norton Hulk movie, but loving Captain America and Thor. J. Michael Straczinsky wrote the story for Thor, and it showed with it's depth and scale. We are huge Babylon 5 fans, so we simply had to see it. If you have yet to see The Avengers, the only absolutely necessary prequel is Thor. You really must see it for critical story elements to truly appreciate The Avengers. The rest of the prequels you can afford to miss, but Iron Man and Captain America are both great and it would help to some extent to see them before the Avengers. After seeing all of the prequels, we were ready to jump into the Avengers last night in 3D IMAX on a 72 foot screen (not that fake IMAX Experience crap on a 25 foot screen). And we had a grand ole time.The movie pretty much starts where Thor left off, story-wise, and quickly advances the plot. Whedon ably does this while developing the myriad characters within. By the time the obligatory massive action sequences occur, you are ""all in"" and right there with these heroes. I would much rather see story than action, personally, but the balance was well handled and kept the user engaged at all levels throughout. Humor and drama were well balanced as well, with every character bringing some humor, but Downey stealing the show as he was destined to do. We were never bored and the 2 and half hours flew by.

2015-05-11,"In five years, we saw the coming of Iron Man, a talented engineer who built a powerful exosuit; the Hulk, a scientist whose rage can cause him to explode into a beast of furious strength; Thor, a god-like extraterrestrial who can summon storms; Captain America, a supersoldier from the past. Combined with the tough and skilled agents of SHIELD, all these heroes would join forces to defend Earth against threats that couldn't otherwise be faced.From the start, Marvel's Avengers jumps right into the universe it set up in all previous films, and it wastes no time in jumping into the action. Loki's arrival immediately brings peril and destruction, causing the heroes to assemble and clash in big, explosive brawls. It all builds up to a massive half-hour climax, where everybody contributes to the fight. The action is often jaw-dropping, as heroes fly all over the city and wrestle with huge waves of extraterrestrials. The heroics are as epic as they come. But even when there's no fighting, the movie remains effortlessly entertaining, thanks to its endearing combination of thrills, humor, and personality.The story could be described as the same thing Seven Samurai was: the simple tale of heroes defending a place. In this film, the heroes are a mis-matched family, where some characters connect and others butt heads. The volatile concoction of personalities is what makes the team so special; each character is given a chance to shine, and together they form a uniquely dysfunctional dynamic that makes their dialogue sharp, their drama tense, and their teamwork compelling. It even goes so far as pumping newfound color and life into characters that existed in previous films, but never had a chance to shine until now (particularly Loki, whose devilish mischief steals the show often; Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Agent Coulson stand out much better in this film as well).The film looks spectacular, with quality photography and editing. There are a lot of unusual camera angles in this movie, and I think it looks awesome. Other shots are crafted in very dynamic ways that not only show off the action, but the characters in evoking ways. Acting is a joy to watch from the whole cast; Robert Downey Jr is as enjoyable as ever as Tony Stark, while Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans provide decently commanding performances. Mark Ruffalo is probably the most pleasant surprise from the cast, who provides a balanced and compelling portrayal of Bruce Banner. Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, and Samuel L. Jackson and Clark Gregg are all fun to watch, and Tom Hiddleston nails it as a bad guy we love to hate. Writing is quite sharp and precise, for great effect. This production uses great-looking sets, props, costumes, locales, and special effects. Alan Silvestri's music score is appropriately heroic and catchy.Avengers comes close to being the end-all-be-all superhero film: one epic experience that brings together multiple heroes for one grand fight, in a manner that feels so naturally entertaining and harmonic.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Content: Very Good | Film: Perfect)",10.0,2015-05,Monday,"acting:0.04, action:0.07, against:0.05, agent:0.06, all:0.14, america:0.03, and:0.34, are:0.12, as:0.22, assemble:0.05, avengers:0.04, awesome:0.04, bad:0.04, banner:0.04, be:0.07, being:0.04, better:0.04, big:0.04, black:0.03, brings:0.11, bruce:0.04, but:0.06, can:0.06, captain:0.03, cast:0.08, character:0.03, characters:0.08, chris:0.08, come:0.04, comes:0.05, coming:0.05, could:0.04, couldn:0.06, dialogue:0.05, downey:0.03, each:0.03, earth:0.04, effects:0.03, end:0.04, entertaining:0.09, entertainment:0.06, epic:0.10, evans:0.04, even:0.06, ever:0.04, experience:0.05, far:0.05, feels:0.05, fight:0.09, fighting:0.05, film:0.12, films:0.07, for:0.04, from:0.10, fun:0.04, given:0.05, god:0.05, goes:0.06, good:0.03, great:0.05, guy:0.05, had:0.03, half:0.05, hawkeye:0.04, hemsworth:0.04, heroes:0.20, hiddleston:0.04, him:0.04, hour:0.06, huge:0.05, hulk:0.02, humor:0.04, in:0.19, into:0.14, iron:0.03, is:0.13, it:0.10, its:0.03, jackson:0.04, jeremy:0.05, johansson:0.04, jr:0.04, life:0.05, like:0.03, loki:0.06, looking:0.05, looks:0.11, lot:0.04, love:0.04, makes:0.08, man:0.03, mark:0.04, marvel:0.03, most:0.03, movie:0.04, much:0.03, never:0.04, no:0.06, not:0.02, now:0.04, of:0.14, off:0.04, one:0.04, only:0.03, other:0.03, others:0.05, out:0.03, over:0.04, past:0.06, perfect:0.09, performances:0.05, place:0.06, previous:0.10, probably:0.05, quite:0.05, renner:0.04, right:0.04, robert:0.03, ruffalo:0.04, same:0.04, samuel:0.04, saw:0.05, scarlett:0.04, set:0.05, show:0.10, simple:0.05, so:0.08, some:0.03, special:0.08, spectacular:0.06, stand:0.06, stark:0.04, start:0.05, story:0.03, superhero:0.03, team:0.04, that:0.11, the:0.40, their:0.09, there:0.05, these:0.04, they:0.05, thing:0.04, think:0.04, this:0.07, thor:0.03, time:0.03, to:0.19, together:0.06, tom:0.04, tony:0.04, universe:0.05, until:0.05, up:0.06, very:0.06, was:0.02, watch:0.06, we:0.07, well:0.03, what:0.03, when:0.03, where:0.08, while:0.04, who:0.09, whole:0.04, widow:0.04, with:0.06, would:0.03, writing:0.06, years:0.04"

2014-02-17,"Marvels The Avengers, or commonly known as The Avengers is an action packed film based on a combination of a series of superhero movies that were all produced by Marvels. The Avengers are an assembly of heroes including Ironman played by Robert Downey Jr., Thor played by Chris Hemsworth, The Incredible Hulk played by Mark Ruffalo, and Captain America played by Chris Evans. After an unexpected enemy begins to threaten the security of the world, Nick Fury, played by Samuel L. Jackson, and his partner, played by Scarlett Johansson, gathers these heroes in order to try to provide peace from the enemy and save the world from crumbling. Though this movie was slow to develop and seemed to drag on at parts through the introduction, the action picks up as the movie proceeds with a well-developed cohesion of parts by the conclusion of the film.The introduction to this movie developed at a seemingly never ending pace. I did not agree with how it seemed to drag out but I sympathize with the director. This had to be done though in order to portray the plot of uniting these heroes and showing the initial skirmishes of the heroes as they met each other. As the heroes began to get along and unite as a team, the development of the film began to become more tightly knit. The characters grew together, starting as people who barely knew each other to fighting side by side against their enemy. With the combination of all the well-known actors in this movie, no one seemed to steal the show or become power hungry for the leading role in the movie. As the film developed, all of the actors sunk into their roles and adapted to their part and the other parts around them gracefully. The cohesion of the film was as well-developed and original as it could be. The Ironman series, Captain America, Hulk, and Thor have already been produced as films by Marvel and in comic books in previous years. This led to a unique and different production by taking all those different films and seamlessly integrated them into one piece. This made for an action based film with the right amount of humor to make it amusing and appealing to the audience.The cinematography and the setting in the film also added to the cohesion of the piece as a whole. The setting was based out of Cleveland but was made to represent New York, with Stark's tower set up to be in the center of the New York City skyline. The real credit should be given to the cinematography of the film which made the film come alive. We as the audience feel like we are right there fighting side by side with the heroes, helping to take down the enemy at hand. In its entirety this piece really captured my attention and left me waiting for more after every scene. Although this film seemed to drag on at the beginning, it ended up being well developed and action packed which kept me wanting more. Along with the cohesion of this piece came a quite original development as the director meshed the different parts and characters together. This allowed them to fight alongside each other to try to save the world from destruction. You will have to watch to find out what happens as the fate of the world is left up to the new team of Avengers.",7.0,2014-02,Monday,"action:0.06, actors:0.06, after:0.05, against:0.03, all:0.05, along:0.07, already:0.03, also:0.02, although:0.03, america:0.04, amount:0.04, an:0.07, and:0.18, are:0.03, around:0.03, as:0.20, at:0.07, audience:0.07, avengers:0.06, be:0.06, become:0.08, been:0.02, beginning:0.04, being:0.03, but:0.03, by:0.22, came:0.03, captain:0.04, characters:0.03, chris:0.05, come:0.03, comic:0.02, could:0.02, development:0.07, did:0.02, different:0.09, director:0.06, done:0.03, down:0.03, downey:0.02, each:0.07, evans:0.03, every:0.02, feel:0.03, fight:0.03, fighting:0.07, film:0.16, films:0.05, find:0.03, for:0.04, from:0.05, fury:0.03, get:0.02, given:0.03, had:0.02, have:0.03, hemsworth:0.03, heroes:0.13, his:0.02, how:0.02, hulk:0.03, humor:0.03, in:0.10, incredible:0.03, into:0.05, is:0.02, it:0.04, its:0.02, jackson:0.03, johansson:0.03, jr:0.02, left:0.07, like:0.02, made:0.07, make:0.02, mark:0.02, marvel:0.02, me:0.04, more:0.06, movie:0.06, movies:0.02, my:0.02, never:0.03, new:0.08, nick:0.03, no:0.02, not:0.01, of:0.21, on:0.05, one:0.03, or:0.04, original:0.08, other:0.08, out:0.05, packed:0.07, part:0.03, parts:0.15, people:0.03, played:0.20, plot:0.02, power:0.04, previous:0.03, quite:0.03, real:0.03, really:0.02, right:0.06, robert:0.02, role:0.03, ruffalo:0.02, samuel:0.03, save:0.07, scarlett:0.03, scene:0.03, seemed:0.15, series:0.07, set:0.03, should:0.03, show:0.03, stark:0.03, superhero:0.02, take:0.03, team:0.05, that:0.01, the:0.57, their:0.06, them:0.06, there:0.02, these:0.05, they:0.02, this:0.11, thor:0.04, those:0.03, though:0.06, through:0.03, to:0.30, together:0.04, up:0.08, was:0.05, watch:0.02, we:0.05, well:0.07, were:0.02, what:0.02, which:0.04, who:0.02, whole:0.03, will:0.02, with:0.11, world:0.10, years:0.03, york:0.07, you:0.02"

I pretty much became bored due to feeling no connection with the characters and nothing unexpected happening...sure there are special effects and a bunch of stuff thrown in just to see if it would stick to the wall, but none of it engaging. Then there were characters that were so shallow that I felt no interest in who they were or what part they played...did Gwineth Paltrow actually get paid for whatever it is she was doing? The Hulk seemed to be more of an after thought in this story as there was no consistency in his role. In the Hulk's first scene he's an uncontrollable force that destroys anything regardless of whether it involved resources that belonged to good or evil. The climax of the movie which involves an alien invasion, was far from exciting due to minimal effort being made to compel the viewer into wondering ""Oh my, whats going to happen now"".

2012-05-07,"One word: Excellent. I've collected comic books on and off for many years, including The Avengers. This movie nailed the feel of the best of them. The characters were great and true to form...Stark as the arrogant genius; Cap as the straight-laced leader; Thor as the mythical demigod; Banner as the tortured scientist with a beast inside him; Black Widow as the super spy martial artist with a dark past; and Hawkeye as the super marksman. The great thing about this film is how different they are and how they play off each other, but come together for the common good to defeat Loki and save the world. Loki, by the way, was outstanding as the merciless villain. I love the way that the movie felt like a sequel to each of the Marvel films that came before it.

2015-07-05,"Back in mid-00s when Marvel announced their intentions for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, we quite honestly didn't believe they could pull it off. Five big budget blockbuster movies before a grande finale. Before that we had had trouble getting even two sequels, and even then they normally hadn't been all that great, with especially the third movie usually sucking something fierce.But they did it. Somehow they went and did it. And yeah, you could argue that they had the advantage of being allowed to switch characters and subjects around freely and that the only ""actual"" sequel, Iron Man 2, was easily the weakest of the bunch, but still. This was a revolutionary movie, something we had never seen before. A phenomenon that changed film making.Furthermore, it's not only a great idea, it's also one of the best superhero films ever made, one of the best action popcorn films as well, and one of my personal favourites. And it's actually easy to see why. You've already established all of your characters, you've built them up and given them clear identities. You also have an amazing ensemble cast of actors, most of them having risen to the highest echelons of Hollywood. You have Joss ""God of Nerds"" Whedon directing and writing. You've already created a need and want for this kind of movie, so you don't have to water it down. It can be an honest and direct superhero film, with quick wit, blazing action and phenomenal, state of the art special effects. No need to sell it to the big audiences by cramming it needlessly full of everything else. You can keep it pure.And it works so well. It's a fast-paced movie, with every scene full of excitement, jokes and entertainment, but Whedon knows what he's doing. There's pacing, there are lulls in between the action, allowing you to re-acquaintance yourself with these characters and their individual story lines, all of which meet and intertwine in this colossus of a movie.The Avengers is pure entertainment. It's only smart in a quick-witted street punk manner, so it's certainly not going to win over the worst of the high brow community, but what it has in spades is charm, entertainment value and pure, high-tuned, perfected action.

After 5 movies the superheroes from Marvel finally assemble in this two-and-a-half-hour-long-roller-coaster of fun. All the actors do an amazing job in bringing their characters alive.

Only Scarlett Johansson could improve in the comedy department, but it is partly the fault of the writers for giving her unfunny jokes. Johansson makes up for it in the action part, though.

2012-05-03,"Before I saw avengers I was expecting to see a action heavy film with little or no script. And now that i have seen it I can say that i was very surprised by the dialogues and the script. The script was witty, smart and well written. The main plot was of course simple, that of a man( in this case a God) wanting to take over the world, but apart from that cliché plot point the script was very good. It was more character based than plot based. The movie gave enough individual time to the heroes(other than hawkeye) in terms of screen time. The point of the film was a team assembling and that team dynamic was brilliantly written and acted. The heroes fought, they disagreed, they had different opinions to things, they had different reasons to go to war, but at the end despite their differences they came together. This team dynamic was brilliantly handled by Joss Whedon. The script was funny at times as well, Joss whedon knew that the avengers wasn't supposed to be a dark knight, it wasn't supposed to be realistic and gritty and scattered with various themes, so instead of making a mindless michael bay film he added his own unique touches which gave the movie and the characters depth while also preserving the summer blockbuster flavour. Each character played a specific part in this team, captain America played the loyal/bound by duty super soldier who turns out to be a brilliant tactician as well. Iron man provided the team with flying abilities and brilliant weaponry, thor had personal reasons to fight this battle, while HULK well he was an unstoppable monster! The scope of this film is huge, unlike any other super hero film. The opposition that these heroes faced could not be dealt by one hero alone and hence the stakes in this movie are much higher and the heroes know that. Some realistic themes were also introduced like whether SHIELD should make nuclear weapons to protect itself from the other worldly armies, these themes were quite relevant in today's times. There were quite a few smart writing choices that whedon made that i cant talk about without giving spoilers. The acting as expected was brilliant. Robert Downey, Chris Evans, Mark Rufallo, Scarlett Johanson,Chris hemsworth and Jeremy renner were all brilliant at their roles. The black widow got more screen time then i expected but that was welcome. The action I thought was very large scale, although i think and i know many might disagree with me, but the action could have been more grander in some parts. All in all this movie was everything it was supposed to be. It balanced the script,the dialogues,the characters and the action very well. Don't compare this to the dark knight cause this is not supposed to be gritty and intense, just be happy that the movie gives to you more than you expected it to.

2012-06-02,"Harboring a great deal of expectation of this record-breaking multi-superhero-in-a-row action mash-up, I finally caught up the last chance to watch it on the big screen, but unfortunately the film has indomitably become my very first disappointment in 2012. Alerted by the general opinion of ""if you can survive the boring first 60 minutes, the latter part will blow you away"", maybe ""boring"" is a lesser word, the inter-conversations among these superheroes are way too tedious to arouse any interest, and in light of my last encounter with THOR (2011), I know he is a boredom, then here comes his worsen twin, Captain America, so it is dumb and dumber situation. Most of characters are reprising their usual roles, Robert Downey Jr.'s sleekness is being harnessed into its maximum quota. So I assume the only revelation could come from Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, the newcomer on screen, and the third candidate of Hulk, Mark Ruffalo, but the truth is they might be a clear torrent, but cannot save this juggernaut from being a destroy-it-all dross. The fighting scenes are the saving grace here which is not a false claim, but it satisfies my eyes without compensates my soul, director Joss Whedon just haphazardly levels everything in Manhattan without any single casualty provided to imply its minimum credibility. No worries at all, we simply witnessed an empty and meaningless catastrophe without any mind activity as we all know Iron Man will not be the sacrifice as a sequel is already set on a release date. Thus, am I over-demanding here? After the invasion of myriads of this sort of big-budget action flicks, THE AVENGERS is no way a standout by any means, none of its actors could stick out with any arresting existence (I might be too desperate to count out Gwyneth Paltrow), Mark Ruffalo is the closest choice of a decent acting in it, all the rest is just the way he or she is, an utterly featherweight character study is the case here. The gags are scarce (ooh, poor Loki), too much SCI-FI doctrines and the narrative in dead earnest (thanks to you, Mr. Samuel L. Jackson) makes the film's lengthy screen time too overt to be slighted, and I waited until the end-credit rolled over, but a second bonus scenes never show off. The film's huge success has baffled me so much and its staggering status of the third biggest grossing film of all time (after AVATAR 2009 and TITANIC 1997) does make me do some solemn post-mortem to question my taste, the conclusion could be that I may be detached from the majority's liking, which thankfully I believe heralds a good sign for me, right?",5.0,2012-06,Saturday,"2012:0.06, acting:0.05, action:0.05, actors:0.05, after:0.08, all:0.11, already:0.05, am:0.05, america:0.03, an:0.06, and:0.14, any:0.20, are:0.10, as:0.05, at:0.03, avengers:0.02, away:0.06, be:0.15, become:0.06, being:0.09, believe:0.06, big:0.08, biggest:0.06, boring:0.12, but:0.11, by:0.06, can:0.03, captain:0.03, character:0.03, characters:0.03, come:0.04, comes:0.05, could:0.12, director:0.05, do:0.04, does:0.04, downey:0.04, end:0.04, everything:0.05, fighting:0.06, film:0.11, finally:0.05, first:0.07, for:0.02, from:0.09, good:0.03, great:0.03, has:0.06, hawkeye:0.04, he:0.06, here:0.18, his:0.03, huge:0.05, hulk:0.03, if:0.03, in:0.12, into:0.04, iron:0.03, is:0.22, it:0.09, its:0.15, jackson:0.05, jeremy:0.05, joss:0.04, jr:0.04, just:0.06, know:0.09, last:0.10, loki:0.03, make:0.04, makes:0.04, man:0.03, mark:0.08, may:0.05, maybe:0.06, me:0.10, might:0.12, mind:0.06, minutes:0.06, most:0.04, much:0.07, my:0.15, never:0.04, no:0.07, not:0.05, of:0.23, off:0.04, on:0.08, only:0.04, opinion:0.06, or:0.03, out:0.06, over:0.08, part:0.05, renner:0.05, rest:0.06, right:0.05, robert:0.04, ruffalo:0.08, samuel:0.05, save:0.06, scenes:0.08, screen:0.12, second:0.06, sequel:0.06, set:0.06, she:0.06, show:0.05, simply:0.06, single:0.06, so:0.08, some:0.03, superhero:0.03, superheroes:0.04, that:0.02, the:0.46, their:0.03, then:0.04, these:0.04, they:0.03, this:0.06, thor:0.03, time:0.06, to:0.12, too:0.16, until:0.06, up:0.06, very:0.03, watch:0.03, way:0.12, we:0.08, whedon:0.04, which:0.07, will:0.07, with:0.04, without:0.15, you:0.08"

The witty one liners, the one on one fights ( watch out for the iron man Thor fight ) keeps the film flowing and never bores. Performance wise everyone's quite good, Downey Jr once again brings the house down with his tony stark, Evans is good as captain America.

2012-05-10,"First off, the Hulk in ""The Incredible Hulk"" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800080/) was animated more realistic and was more aesthetically pleasing. Second, I heard somebody in the movie theater say ""Thor looks like he came out of re-hab"" Ouch. You have to agree; after watching the movie ""Thor"" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800369/), he lost a lot of muscle; looking more like a guy in a movie suit, acting like Thor, and looking less like a god of thunder. Actor, Chris Hemsworth must have been juggling the filming of ""The Avengers"" with ""The Cabin In The Woods"", effectively eating away at the hard work put into building his physique. Let's hope Chris Hemsworth gets a free pass to rebuild his ""Thor"" muscles; and please don't forget the legs, as a life action rendition of super hero lore, is definitely enhanced by them; it is realistic fantasy, after all; may as well go for gold. Same goes for Captain America, who is just too skinny to be believable.Can it be better? Of course. Would I watch this movie again? Yes, already watched it three times.

They meshed seamlessly for the tasks at hand after being well introduced to Marvel newcomers over the first 50 minutes or so.Absolutely MUST SEE cinema, on the big screen.

My initial concerns were about how the movie would live up to this enormous hype it had built up. Surprisingly enough, it exceeded my expectations in a good way. The story and dialog was created with full blown Hollywood style treatment, but enjoyable and sometimes very funny. The character development was also strong, something that most directors cannot handle due to the fact that making 7 superheroes individually stand out is pretty difficult.

Funny goes with dark and dramatic, modern arm in arm with classic storytelling methods and tropes. Comprehensible special effects and great use of visual space although aspect ratio is a compromise largely due to 3D and staying true to actor's heights (Also w Hulks) so it's not cinematographically outstanding. There's definitely been a discussion about this by the creative and camera departments but overall it still felt satisfying to watch and they pull of the comic- book magic/sci-fi realism well.But the most astonishing thing you'll feel watching this film is that it works. Somehow all the ingredients work even if they don't seem to at first, which is the story of Avengers.

2012-05-15,"I was waiting for the Avengers ever since I heard that they would make a movie with this theme and scenario. Having watched all the previous films with the superheroes that supposedly would form the first Avengers team (Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk) I have to admit that I was very anxious as some of them didn't quite leave up to my expectations. Although to be honest my expectations sometimes can be quite high.The movie didn't disappoint me at all. The lines and the acting of everyone involved I think were ranging from very good to exceptional. The movie doesn't bore you with the background of its characters since you are supposed to be already aware of their past. And the combat scenes I think that they had the right amount of humor and action to make them a fan's wet dream.Therefore I highly recommend to everyone, fan or no fan to watch it.And now all we have to wait is Prometheus and Dark Knight Rises :)",9.0,2012-05,Tuesday,"acting:0.08, action:0.05, all:0.12, already:0.10, although:0.10, america:0.06, amount:0.12, and:0.18, are:0.05, as:0.04, at:0.05, avengers:0.09, be:0.14, can:0.06, captain:0.06, characters:0.05, dark:0.09, didn:0.17, doesn:0.09, ever:0.07, everyone:0.17, expectations:0.20, fan:0.25, films:0.07, first:0.06, for:0.04, from:0.05, good:0.05, had:0.06, have:0.09, having:0.10, high:0.09, highly:0.11, hulk:0.05, humor:0.09, iron:0.05, is:0.03, it:0.03, its:0.07, knight:0.10, lines:0.10, make:0.14, man:0.05, me:0.06, movie:0.11, my:0.11, no:0.06, now:0.08, of:0.16, or:0.06, past:0.12, previous:0.10, quite:0.19, recommend:0.11, right:0.09, scenes:0.07, since:0.18, some:0.06, superheroes:0.08, team:0.08, that:0.15, the:0.33, their:0.06, them:0.12, they:0.10, think:0.14, this:0.03, thor:0.06, to:0.29, up:0.06, very:0.12, wait:0.10, was:0.08, watch:0.06, watched:0.10, we:0.07, were:0.06, with:0.12, would:0.12, you:0.09"
2012-05-05,"The Avengers is the long-awaited Marvel superhero film since it was announced after the credits in the first Iron Man film. The previous installments leading to the grand beast that is The Avengers were Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger, and Thor. The heroes are, in case you don't already know, are Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and they're all brought together as a team by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. They're mission is, basically, to stop Thor's evil brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleson), from taking over the world. I really, really liked The Avengers. I didn't seem to love and adore it like many other people do, but I thought it was incredibly well made, very funny, thrilling as hell, beautifully written, and a lot of fun. What really makes The Avengers work so well is the characters. Director Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Serenity) did a great job establishing the characters and balancing them and their interactions without it becoming too convoluted. It was a little messy in the first 30 minutes or so getting them all together, but that's perfectly understandable because you have 6 or 7 major characters and it's not an easy job giving each of them a brief introduction then bringing them together. Joss Whedon accomplished it as good as it could have been, so he gets points for that. That is to say, what carries you through the messy first 30 minutes is the script. It's so cleverly written by Joss Whedon and Zak Penn that you don't even care about it constantly going from place-to-place and character-to-character because (1) you'll be laughing your way through it and (2) it's nice to see these beloved characters on the big screen, whether the substance is good or not. Once the heroes are together as a team, it gets much better. Robert Downey Jr. is great, as always, as Iron Man, always saying wise remarks, making fun of the heroes (at first), and trying to make Bruce Banner angry. Mark Ruffalo does a good job as Banner/Hulk, bringing something new and fresh to the character that you didn't see in The Incredible Hulk or Hulk (2003). I also have to praise Tom Hiddleson as Loki. He's great. He delivers a dark and menacing performance that's almost as good as what Heath Ledger delivered as the Joker in The Dark Knight. What can I really say? Everyone here does a great job. It's really the script and characters that carry the movie, and I can't praise Joss Whedon enough for smoothly pacing this story with these complex characters so well. Whedon just makes them work so well together, even when they hate each other at first. The big 45-minute long action finale is thrilling. It's visually exciting, the action is phenomenally awesome, and each character has their moment of badassery, as well as their big shining moment. The Hulk steals the show several times, especially when he cleans the floor with Loki, literally. This isn't mindless Michael Bay action. It's nicely shot and choreographed and there's substance. The heroes work together and form a bond, and its just great. The Avengers isn't perfect, but overall it's as entertaining as it needs to be. The only problems I can think of is a flawed, but watchable, first half-hour and a couple moments that fall flat. Go in expecting rich and colorful characters, clever dialogue, large spectacle, and fun action, and make sure you thank Joss Whedon on your way out.

2012-11-11,"I will not make this review very long, but you can add it to anyone else's that gave this a 3 out of 10. First of all, I will say that this film is perhaps the first one (for me ever) that has warranted obtaining it by pirating it from the internet. I could not sleep had I spent $10 at the theater on it, and for that matter $3.00 for a one-evening rental of it on DVD.As I downloaded it, I was really excited, mostly just basing it off the reviews and records it set on its opening weekend and through the summer of 2012 even. And wow, was I so wrong in doing that. Keep in mind, I know that it holds true to form to comic books and their characters depicted in the movie, but I have seen Iron Man, Captain America and the last two Incredible Hulk remakes, and somehow this grouping of all the Marvel characters, diminishes the value of all the characters' individual films they lead in so much its embarrassing. I really liked Iron Man but his one- or two-liners in this film are not funny, but very cheesy and predictable. The costumes on some of the characters are laughably ridiculous, namely Loki his ""ram-looking horns"" or whatever, Hawkeye and his blue contacts and then CGI diminishes all of the others' looks. And finally it speaks enough for itself when this is just one of a very few films I have ever watched where I stopped ( or paused) it every 10 or 20 minutes to go do something else, come back a couple hours later, continue watching,only to repeat the same thing again and again. It took about a day for me to finish it! I mean that just says something of how dull and dopey this film is at times. All the fan-boys who may argue out there, don't please because I obviously realize you are a fan-boy. Anyone else looking for a ""truly good, Oscar-winning, or perhaps classic and one-for-the-history-books"" type of film, look elsewhere.",3.0,2012-11,Sunday,"10:0.15, 2012:0.06, about:0.04, again:0.10, all:0.13, america:0.04, and:0.27, anyone:0.13, are:0.09, as:0.03, at:0.07, back:0.06, because:0.04, but:0.10, by:0.04, can:0.04, captain:0.04, cgi:0.06, characters:0.13, come:0.05, comic:0.04, could:0.04, day:0.07, do:0.04, don:0.04, else:0.20, enough:0.05, even:0.04, ever:0.09, every:0.05, fan:0.10, few:0.05, film:0.12, films:0.09, finally:0.06, first:0.08, for:0.17, from:0.03, funny:0.05, go:0.05, good:0.03, had:0.04, has:0.03, have:0.06, hawkeye:0.05, his:0.12, hours:0.07, how:0.04, hulk:0.03, in:0.11, incredible:0.06, individual:0.07, iron:0.07, is:0.06, it:0.27, its:0.09, itself:0.07, just:0.10, keep:0.07, know:0.05, last:0.06, liked:0.07, loki:0.04, long:0.05, look:0.06, looking:0.13, looks:0.07, make:0.04, man:0.07, marvel:0.03, may:0.06, me:0.08, mind:0.07, minutes:0.07, movie:0.02, much:0.04, not:0.08, of:0.22, off:0.05, on:0.12, one:0.14, only:0.04, or:0.18, others:0.06, out:0.07, really:0.07, review:0.06, reviews:0.07, same:0.05, say:0.05, seen:0.05, set:0.06, so:0.06, some:0.04, something:0.11, summer:0.07, that:0.16, the:0.30, theater:0.07, their:0.04, then:0.05, there:0.03, they:0.03, thing:0.05, this:0.15, through:0.06, times:0.06, to:0.12, true:0.07, truly:0.07, two:0.11, very:0.12, was:0.05, watched:0.06, watching:0.05, when:0.04, where:0.05, who:0.04, will:0.07, wrong:0.07, you:0.06"
2012-05-04,"""So awesome."" Those were the first two words that came to mind as I scoured my brain in an effort to find a fitting description of what I had just witnessed. Why be loquacious, when two such honestly efficient words will do? Come on, what else do you want me to say? The Avengers hits the ground in overdrive, downs a six-pack of energy drinks, and rarely takes a breath during the course of its purely entertaining 142 minute runtime.Burdened with a glorious purpose, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) makes his presence known quickly. He comes to earth to rule and leaves Nick Fury (Samuel L. ""Snakes on a Plane"" Jackson) and his awesome eyepatch with no choice but to revisit the failed Avengers Initiative. The film recognizes that there are a lot of male egos that need clashing and thus wastes no time in delivering exactly what the audience wants to see – 2+ hours of superhero bliss.As intense and exhilarating as the climactic 40+ minute battle against Loki and his minions is, the hero vs. hero, alpha male vs. alpha male build up is even better. Captain America vs. Thor. Iron Man vs. Thor. Thor vs. Hulk. Hawkeye vs. Black Widow. Come on now. I think I even saw a kitchen sink in there battling it out. Director Joss Whedon clearly thought through the scenarios that fans would want and he flawlessly delivers them with style. A little panache, if you will. Executing the individual battles in a way that does justice to the characters is not an easy task, but the special effects and 7.1 Surround Sound are crafted to perfection.If you've seen the individual Avenger movies then you know exactly what to expect from the characters. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) cracks wise with his sarcastic humor, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) cracks heads with his magic hammer, Captain America (Chris Evans) cracks nary a smile with his old-school, no-nonsense patriotism, and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), well, he just smashes.Add Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), the former Russian assassin, and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), a master with the bow and arrow, to the mix and that is a whole lot of superheroes demanding a limited amount of screen time. The good news is Whedon handles this potential problem seamlessly, giving everybody ample time to do their thing and play their part. The biggest surprise, both literally and figuratively, has to be The Hulk. Not only is this the most ""realistic"" version of the beloved green rage monster that's been delivered to the big screen, but he simply steals every scene he's in.The Avengers is the kind of roller coaster thrill ride of a movie that takes me back to the magic I felt as a kid every time I walked into the theater and sat down to watch a much-anticipated Summer blockbuster. It's a refreshing blend of humor and action that lets you check out of your reality for a couple of hours and check into an exciting world where good triumphs evil and it does so in marvelously inventive ways.If you can't enjoy The Avengers then I fear you simply can't enjoy life.

2012-11-19,"If you're a fan of comic books or superhero movies, then The Avengers by Marvel will surely not disappoint. Watching the movie three times myself, I each time have liked the movie more and more. Compared to the blockbuster superhero movies that have come out in theaters in the summer of 2012, this movie seems to top Spider-Man and Batman simply because of the cast of superheroes that are present in this movie. This movie seems to put together the best of the best superheroes for a one big hit movie. With the names of The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Hawkeye, and Black Widow, this movie compares to an all-star game of athletes in any given sport. In comparing the movie to other movies by Marvel, this movie stands out in a good way. This movie adds more action and more punch lines than a comic book nerd could ever dream of. In terms of putting the superheroes together, The Avengers does a marvelous job. The Avengers is essentially a sequel to Thor and Captain America, taking elements from each movie. After Loki gets exiled from his home planet of Asgard as seen in Thor after attempting to rule Asgard, he seeks out to rule again. After Captain America gets unfrozen, he is seen working out when Nick Fury stops by. Nick Fury is the man responsible for recruiting and putting together the Avengers. At first, things are shaky as the superheroes' egos clash rather than mesh together. This is easily done by Loki, shifting the attention away from him and onto personal attacks against one another by the Avengers. The constant bickering between the superheroes could have a negative impact on the audience , but it doesn't diminish the movie as a whole. In the movie, the characters don't seem to have changed from their own movies, although Iron Man learns the value of working with others. Joss Whedon is one of the best directors in the film industry and this movie proves to be one of his best big screen productions. This movie sets the bar for superhero movies as none in my experience of watching superhero movies has come close to matching it. Marvel and DC Comics will have a big challenge ahead of them when they come out with new movies because any that doesn't match The Avengers would be a disappointment.",10.0,2012-11,Monday,"2012:0.05, action:0.02, after:0.11, again:0.04, against:0.05, all:0.02, although:0.05, america:0.09, an:0.03, and:0.14, another:0.04, any:0.07, are:0.05, as:0.09, at:0.03, audience:0.05, avengers:0.13, away:0.05, batman:0.05, be:0.05, because:0.07, best:0.12, between:0.04, big:0.11, black:0.03, blockbuster:0.05, book:0.04, but:0.02, by:0.14, captain:0.09, cast:0.04, characters:0.03, come:0.12, comic:0.07, comics:0.05, could:0.07, does:0.04, doesn:0.09, don:0.03, done:0.04, each:0.07, ever:0.04, experience:0.05, fan:0.04, film:0.02, first:0.03, for:0.06, from:0.10, fury:0.08, gets:0.10, given:0.05, good:0.03, has:0.03, have:0.11, hawkeye:0.04, he:0.06, him:0.04, his:0.06, hulk:0.03, if:0.03, in:0.19, incredible:0.04, iron:0.05, is:0.08, it:0.03, job:0.04, joss:0.03, liked:0.05, lines:0.05, loki:0.06, man:0.11, marvel:0.08, more:0.11, movie:0.27, movies:0.19, my:0.03, new:0.04, nick:0.08, not:0.02, of:0.24, on:0.02, one:0.09, or:0.03, other:0.03, others:0.05, out:0.14, own:0.04, put:0.05, rather:0.06, re:0.05, screen:0.04, seem:0.06, seems:0.10, seen:0.07, sequel:0.05, simply:0.05, star:0.05, summer:0.06, superhero:0.13, superheroes:0.19, than:0.06, that:0.06, the:0.45, their:0.03, them:0.03, then:0.04, they:0.03, things:0.05, this:0.15, thor:0.08, time:0.03, times:0.05, to:0.18, together:0.13, top:0.05, watching:0.08, way:0.04, whedon:0.03, when:0.06, whole:0.05, widow:0.04, will:0.06, with:0.06, would:0.03, you:0.02"

The film is not necessarily a thought-provoking Acadey Award winning film, but is is entertainment of the highest order, with some wonderfully funny moments and, believe it or not, strong character development for the entire Cast.Joss Whedon deserves the vast amount of credit. He reminds me of a young Steven Spielberg, around the time of Jaws and Close Encounter: young, successful, enjoying his work, and completely ignored by his elderly, and jealous, peers.I suspect, and hope, the sequel will delve a little deeper into drama and the psyche of each character.

2012-05-24,"Perhaps the highest praise I can offer The Avengers is that it is exactly like a classic comic book story come to life. The epic scope, the hopelessly outnumbered team of heroes fighting for our lives, the diabolical villains, and action, action, and more actionit's all here in one incredible live-action package. Is The Avengers the best superhero film ever made? Maybe not, but considering the grand scale and everything that had to come together just to avoid a bomb, it's hard not to dismiss the few minor weaknesses and simply applaud what does work, which is after all nearly everything.True, The Avengers is a very long movie, and if you haven't seen the other Marvel superhero films (especially Thor and Captain America), it may take you a while to figure out exactly what's going on. But this isn't rocket science, it's a comic book come to life, and it won't take even a complete newcomer long to get up to speed.Director and screenwriter Joss Whedon has to get a lot of the credit for making the film such a success. Whedon clearly knows and loves the characters he's working with, and he wisely takes his time exploring each hero's personality. Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.) , Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) could have easily just been heartless blockbusters, but Whedon instills each of them with personal style and spirit. The banter between the various heroes as they slowly—and painfully—learn to work together is nearly as exciting as the inevitable showdown between the forces of good and evil.Nearly, that is. The climax is one of the grandest spectacles of mayhem ever filmed, far surpassing the similar final battles that have been the apex of the various Transformer movies. As in the comics, the Avengers are brought together by the machinations of Loki, Thor's evil brother, once again played to brilliant perfection by Tom Hiddleston. But this time Loki has an army of extraterrestrials backing him up, and it is suggested that there are other forces involved that may be even more wicked than Loki himself.Throw in Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, head of the clandestine S.H.I.E.L.D. organization, and you have everything a long-time Avengers aficionado could have hoped for. Incredibly thrilling, very well-acted and directed, with a witty script and heroes you can really believe in, at least for a couple of hoursThe Avengers is an instant action classic.",10.0,2012-05,Thursday,"action:0.13, after:0.04, again:0.04, all:0.04, america:0.06, an:0.06, and:0.30, are:0.05, army:0.06, as:0.12, at:0.03, avengers:0.14, be:0.03, been:0.07, believe:0.06, best:0.03, between:0.09, black:0.04, book:0.09, brilliant:0.06, brother:0.05, brought:0.06, but:0.08, by:0.06, can:0.06, captain:0.06, characters:0.03, chris:0.09, come:0.13, comic:0.07, comics:0.05, could:0.08, director:0.05, does:0.04, downey:0.04, each:0.07, epic:0.06, especially:0.05, evans:0.05, even:0.07, ever:0.08, everything:0.14, evil:0.11, exciting:0.06, far:0.05, few:0.05, fighting:0.06, film:0.05, films:0.04, final:0.06, for:0.08, fury:0.04, get:0.07, going:0.04, good:0.03, had:0.03, hard:0.05, has:0.06, have:0.10, haven:0.06, hawkeye:0.04, he:0.06, hemsworth:0.05, here:0.04, hero:0.04, heroes:0.11, hiddleston:0.05, him:0.04, his:0.03, hours:0.06, hulk:0.03, if:0.03, in:0.08, incredible:0.05, iron:0.03, is:0.18, isn:0.05, it:0.12, jackson:0.05, jeremy:0.05, johansson:0.05, joss:0.04, jr:0.04, just:0.06, least:0.05, life:0.10, like:0.03, loki:0.10, long:0.14, lot:0.04, made:0.04, making:0.05, man:0.03, mark:0.04, marvel:0.03, may:0.11, maybe:0.06, more:0.06, movie:0.02, movies:0.03, nick:0.04, not:0.05, of:0.19, on:0.03, once:0.05, one:0.05, other:0.07, our:0.06, out:0.03, played:0.05, really:0.03, renner:0.05, robert:0.04, ruffalo:0.04, samuel:0.05, scarlett:0.04, script:0.05, seen:0.04, simply:0.06, story:0.03, such:0.05, superhero:0.07, take:0.10, takes:0.06, team:0.04, than:0.03, that:0.12, the:0.45, them:0.03, there:0.03, they:0.03, this:0.04, thor:0.09, time:0.09, to:0.19, together:0.10, tom:0.05, true:0.06, up:0.06, very:0.07, well:0.03, what:0.06, whedon:0.11, which:0.04, while:0.05, widow:0.04, with:0.07, witty:0.06, won:0.06, work:0.09, you:0.10"
2012-05-07,"The Avengers became a big success at the box office but, in reality, it's not that great. It's a fine film, with a lot of action. In the end, however, it's a passable Hollywood product. The plot is something that only a comic book reader will enjoy or fully understand, and it's there only to show several different and iconic superheroes working together. The actors do a fine job but, for me, there were no standout performances. Perhaps the only one who stood out was Chris Evans as Captain America because he was righteous, old-fashioned, and he wasn't sarcastic. And this brings me to the script by Joss Whedon, which is quite poor. I guess it wasn't easy to write a good screenplay in which each superhero has to seem relevant. This is the biggest reason why the script fails to surprise. For example, Robert Downey Jr. is his usual self as Iron Man but there's nothing that stands out in his performance. He had a lot more to work with in Iron Man (2008), and there was plenty more drama there too. The script is rather predictable, and the characters don't come off well because they have nothing important to say. The main villain Loki is also a letdown. I like Tom Hiddleston but his character has little to do except walk, talk and look menacing. Add to this a horde of enemies about whom we know almost nothing and we have one rather boring second half of the film. The heroes fight the enemies like they're shooting cans at target practice. They employ their skills, and it's all quite dull because there are too many weak and faceless enemies. The final battle reminded me a lot of Transformers (2007). Joss Whedon does a good job as director, but The Avengers is still a by the numbers action summer blockbuster. Yes, the special effects are impressive in places. Other than that there's nothing here to get excited about. Films like Iron Man (2008), Thor (2011) and The Incredible Hulk (2008) had more to like than this film. The addition of silly and predictable humor only makes the film seem more forgettable. The Avengers entertains during most of its running time but there's nothing here to take to heart.",9.0,2012-05,Monday,"about:0.07, action:0.05, actors:0.05, all:0.02, almost:0.05, also:0.04, america:0.03, and:0.21, are:0.05, as:0.07, at:0.06, avengers:0.07, battle:0.05, because:0.12, big:0.04, biggest:0.07, blockbuster:0.06, book:0.04, boring:0.06, brings:0.06, but:0.13, by:0.06, captain:0.03, character:0.03, characters:0.03, chris:0.05, come:0.04, comic:0.04, different:0.05, director:0.05, do:0.08, does:0.04, don:0.04, downey:0.04, each:0.04, effects:0.04, end:0.05, enjoy:0.05, evans:0.05, fight:0.05, film:0.11, films:0.04, final:0.06, for:0.04, get:0.04, good:0.06, great:0.03, had:0.07, half:0.06, has:0.06, have:0.05, he:0.10, here:0.09, heroes:0.04, hiddleston:0.05, his:0.10, hollywood:0.06, however:0.05, hulk:0.03, humor:0.05, impressive:0.07, in:0.12, incredible:0.05, iron:0.09, is:0.13, it:0.11, its:0.04, job:0.10, joss:0.08, jr:0.04, know:0.04, like:0.11, little:0.05, loki:0.03, look:0.05, lot:0.13, main:0.05, makes:0.05, man:0.09, many:0.04, me:0.10, more:0.13, most:0.04, no:0.04, not:0.02, nothing:0.25, of:0.11, off:0.04, old:0.06, one:0.05, only:0.15, or:0.03, other:0.03, out:0.06, performance:0.06, performances:0.06, plot:0.04, quite:0.11, rather:0.13, re:0.05, reason:0.06, robert:0.04, say:0.04, script:0.16, second:0.06, seem:0.13, show:0.06, something:0.05, special:0.04, still:0.04, summer:0.06, superhero:0.04, superheroes:0.04, take:0.05, than:0.07, that:0.08, the:0.39, their:0.03, there:0.24, they:0.09, this:0.08, thor:0.03, time:0.03, to:0.23, together:0.04, tom:0.05, too:0.08, transformers:0.06, understand:0.06, villain:0.05, was:0.07, wasn:0.11, we:0.08, well:0.03, were:0.03, whedon:0.07, which:0.07, who:0.03, why:0.05, will:0.03, with:0.05, work:0.05, yes:0.06"
2013-07-24,"The Avengers (2012) a movie nearly a decade in the assembling, (yes pun intendedf**k you if you don't think it's funny) is a kick ass movie, through and through, what all the fan boys have been waiting for and showing average audiences why comic-book story arch's are so entertaining and can make exciting movies. The movie begins where Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), Thor (2011), Iron Man 2 (2010) and the original movie, and The Incredible Hulk (2008) led us to, an assembly of 'Marvel"", a spectacle unlike any super-hero movie, or movie period has before. Loki, Thor's adopted brother, has come to earth via S.H.I.E.L.D tampering with a magic cube known as the Tesseract, which he in-turn steals from the agency along with converting Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Dr. Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) to the dark side with a magic spear he has brought with him. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) see's no alternative to fight this ""God"" from another dimension than to restart the ""Avenger Initiative"" and bring together the worlds finest heroes, Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), recently thawed out Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and to track the Tesseract with his knowledge of Gamma Radiation, Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), who, just for good measure, happens to morph into a huge green monster when he's aggravated.Director Joss Whedon handles the film with finesse, and the movie lives up to expectations, all around. The 3D presentation is excellent, and really stands out during the climax, which I have to commend Joss Whedon and those responsible for setting it during the day, helping the 3D stand out.

2012-05-04,"I knew this movie was going to be good, but I thought 96% on RottenTomatoes and 8.9 on IMDb was a little too much for a movie like this. Oh boy how wrong I was. This film was not good, it was EPIC! With all caps and an exclamation mark.We have all our favorite heroes in a single movie, played by some great actors, driven by over the top special effects and co-ordinated by a skillful director, who also rocks with the dialogs. I think it took a great deal of pre-production and in-production work by Joss Wheedon to make these unique characters work well in a single film and he did a terrific job in keeping together all these amazing actors.There was no dull moment in this film. It was very well paced, wonderfully done and greatly enjoyed. The first half consisted of getting all the heroes together, introducing the plot and the characters, but it was done with such finesse, that I didn't even realize how long this part took. The film was very entertaining throughout, with hilarious comic reliefs, exciting action and wonderful score by Alan Silvestri.I loved when all of the Avengers were together and just talked, because the awesome script really showed their character and why they're not really good as a team. But they finally got on with each other and the final battle commenced - the most epic final battle after, of course, Lord of the Rings. There's a shot in this scene, which just blew my mind. It was a single shot, with no cuts at all, showing all the characters fighting the alien hordes and it was just fantastic.I first felt sad, when I heard Edward Norton won't be reprising his role as Bruce Banner, but as soon as Mark Ruffalo appeared on screen, I thought: ""Way better than Ed Norton."" They made a great choice in casting him, he was much more convincing and less greedy. Norton may be angry with himself, but he won't turn green anymore.What Joss Wheedon did really well is that he deepened all the supporting characters we've seen in the other films. We learned a lot about Black Widow, about Hawkeye and even about Agent Coulson. The writer is really great with all the different characters, because it feels like we're watching people who could very well exist, not just superhero cardboard cut-outs. Most films like this - ahem Superman ahem - only have that.I can honestly say I loved The Avengers, I don't care if it's too mainstream. The superhero movies are my favorite sub-genre!

No one involved in this production seemed to take anything for granted. Everyone (actors, FX people, writers, director, etc.) all brought their A-game. It truly is the gem they had promised and truly is a worthy holder of the crown.Joss managed to reintroduce characters that we all love, make them seem fresh, make them seem new, and then having them all together without weighting any particular character more than the other. He's the master! My favorite critic quote that points this out: ""The result is a kitchen sink movie that doesn't feel confused or messy.

2019-06-07,"The movie was such a huge box office success that I tried really hard to like it. I just couldn't. Just to be certain, I gave it a second viewing, and disliked it just as much the second time around.Firstly, if you haven't seen Thor, Iron Man, Captain America or The Incredible Hulk, you'll have no idea who the characters are and what they're all about. There haven't been films about Black Widow or Hawkeye, so they don't really matter anyway. The film played like a medley of all of these super hero movies and didn't really offer anything we haven't seen in these movies. Also, due to way too many protagonists for one film, none of them were given the opportunity to develop. In fact, I found all the characters incredibly shallow, and didn't like any of them. My favorite character in the film is probably Hulk.Everything about this film was so overblown and overdone to the level where nothing was believable - within the context of the genre, off course. 'The Avengers' was so CGI heavy that it was difficult to have fun with it. The film also had so many plot flaws and credibility issues. Everything was simply done for effect at the disposal of an interesting plot. Iron Man is just as annoying as in his own franchise (although he is the deepest character of all). So, a mere mortal in a suit Tony Stark (Iron Man) can actually outwit a god like Thor??? Wow, not much hope for gods... The same goes for the powerful god Loki, who is outwitted and outsmarted so easily.The action in 'Dragon Wars' and 'Transformers' was a lot more realistic and more enjoyable than this.

2012-11-25,"The Avengers, is a movie that appeals to the senses. No not touch or taste, but with so many special effects, great sounds quality, and so many different scene set ups it makes you feel like you're actually there in the movie fighting alongside with The Avengers. Hey, you might even give yourself a super hero name to make you feel like one of the crew. Avenger's style is much different than many other super hero movies that there has been in the past. Marvel has struck gold with the concept that they have brought forth to the millions of fans of their superhero army. Every child had that one super hero that they wanted to be as a kid while they were growing up. Yeah Marvel has given each one of these heroes their fame separately, but that way is a thing of the past. What's better to hit two birds with one stone you might ask? How about ten birds with one stone? That's what The Avengers creators did when they brought together all of your child hood heroes into one movie. Just the idea is pure genius. Yeah a single character may appeal to wide audience but having multiple characters with millions of followers that would want to see their movie all together equals big money. So that's why the concept of this movie as a whole is a win for the Marvel Company. The way that all of the characters in this film were brought together was a great way to bring the viewer up to date. Even if the viewer didn't watch one Marvel movie or pick up a comic book before this could comprehend what was going on. Marvel introduced one character at a time so that the viewer would not get all jumbled up and they would also show where the character has been of that time, not just by plucking them from thin air. Now on to the bad of the movie. It was very hard to find the bad in this movie but there were a few things that could be pointed out. The fact that Marvel decided to only go with a select few of their characters and not bring all of them into this movie could have been heart breaking for all of those Batman fans out there or even the little kid with his Spiderman underwear, but except for those few and very small details The Avengers is a must see.",10.0,2012-11,Sunday,"about:0.03, actually:0.05, all:0.12, also:0.03, and:0.06, army:0.05, as:0.04, at:0.03, audience:0.05, avenger:0.05, avengers:0.09, bad:0.08, batman:0.05, be:0.05, been:0.10, before:0.04, better:0.04, big:0.04, book:0.04, bring:0.11, brought:0.17, but:0.10, by:0.03, character:0.09, characters:0.08, comic:0.03, could:0.11, did:0.04, didn:0.04, different:0.09, each:0.03, effects:0.03, even:0.10, every:0.04, fact:0.05, fans:0.09, feel:0.09, few:0.13, fighting:0.05, film:0.02, find:0.05, for:0.06, from:0.03, get:0.03, give:0.04, given:0.05, go:0.04, going:0.04, great:0.06, had:0.03, hard:0.05, has:0.11, have:0.05, having:0.05, hero:0.12, heroes:0.07, his:0.03, how:0.03, idea:0.06, if:0.03, in:0.07, into:0.07, is:0.10, it:0.03, just:0.05, like:0.05, little:0.04, make:0.04, makes:0.04, many:0.11, marvel:0.17, may:0.05, might:0.11, money:0.06, movie:0.16, movies:0.03, much:0.03, must:0.04, no:0.03, not:0.09, now:0.04, of:0.22, on:0.05, one:0.18, only:0.03, or:0.09, other:0.03, out:0.06, past:0.12, re:0.05, scene:0.04, see:0.06, set:0.05, show:0.05, single:0.06, so:0.10, special:0.04, super:0.12, superhero:0.03, than:0.03, that:0.26, the:0.38, their:0.12, them:0.06, there:0.11, these:0.04, they:0.13, thing:0.04, things:0.05, this:0.08, those:0.08, time:0.06, to:0.19, together:0.10, two:0.04, up:0.12, very:0.06, want:0.04, was:0.06, watch:0.03, way:0.11, were:0.09, what:0.09, when:0.03, where:0.04, while:0.04, whole:0.05, why:0.04, with:0.16, would:0.09, you:0.12, your:0.04"
2012-04-29,"Luck was on our side to all Marvel's Universe fans in Mexico since The Avengers premiered this Friday 04/27 just one week previous to the US release. Yes, the movie is great, Yes the acting is really good, Double yes on special effects, especially the ones related to the great battle in the city. Now what would I personally did not grant a perfect review of this most anticipated reunion of this eclectic group of superheroes?Because I do personally believe it took the movie too long to separate the individual characters into the actual group. Of course this is a personal opinion and even it might be possible this is exactly how the screenplay was actually written, but nevertheless... If the Hunger Games has any potential contender of putting a fight on this still baby-year in movies, The Avengers is the one movie that has what it takes to give a good one.What can you expect from this movie... Tons of action? Of course Some light background on each of the main players? Sure thing Humor? Not as much as you could have and certainly, the biggest laugh in the theater came from a scene of the least expected character... trust me on this one!So all in all, this is a GREAT movie to watch... the 2+ hours just fly by and I exited the theater satisfied with Director Joss Whedon job. I almost agreed with another review stating that all main characters did have at least one big scene during the film, yet part of the missing point of my rating is that, in my mind, Iron Man/Tony Stark appearance during the film was somehow larger than the rest of the characters.I am not a connoisseur of the actual comic, but it would dare to guess that the majority of the hard core fans of this history will be pleased.Of course this is not Oscar material, but hey, this type of movies (Harry Potter, Batman, Superman, etc) is the reason we go to the movies... to escape reality for some time and and root for the good guys.And these assembly of actors portraying these superheroes did a wonderful job.Oh... and maybe last, but definitely not least, Samuel L Jackson on his role of Director Nick Fury is great and you can definitely tell there are more than a couple of SLJ's personal touches on his performance that become the cherry on this exquisite and enjoyable cake known as The Avengers.",9.0,2012-04,Sunday,"acting:0.04, action:0.02, actors:0.04, actually:0.05, all:0.08, almost:0.05, am:0.04, and:0.14, another:0.04, any:0.04, are:0.02, as:0.07, at:0.03, avengers:0.07, batman:0.05, battle:0.05, be:0.05, because:0.03, become:0.06, believe:0.05, big:0.04, biggest:0.06, but:0.08, by:0.03, came:0.05, can:0.06, certainly:0.06, character:0.03, characters:0.08, comic:0.03, could:0.04, course:0.15, definitely:0.10, did:0.11, director:0.08, do:0.04, each:0.03, effects:0.03, especially:0.04, even:0.03, expect:0.05, expected:0.05, fans:0.09, fight:0.04, film:0.05, for:0.04, from:0.05, fury:0.04, give:0.04, go:0.04, good:0.08, great:0.11, group:0.11, guys:0.05, hard:0.05, has:0.05, have:0.05, his:0.06, hours:0.05, how:0.03, humor:0.04, if:0.03, in:0.11, individual:0.06, into:0.03, iron:0.03, is:0.17, it:0.07, jackson:0.04, job:0.09, joss:0.03, just:0.05, last:0.05, least:0.15, long:0.04, main:0.10, man:0.03, marvel:0.03, maybe:0.05, me:0.03, might:0.05, mind:0.05, more:0.03, most:0.03, movie:0.09, movies:0.08, much:0.03, my:0.06, nick:0.04, not:0.11, now:0.04, of:0.32, on:0.19, one:0.11, opinion:0.06, our:0.05, part:0.04, perfect:0.04, performance:0.05, point:0.05, previous:0.05, rating:0.06, really:0.03, reason:0.05, rest:0.05, review:0.10, role:0.05, samuel:0.04, scene:0.08, since:0.05, so:0.03, some:0.06, special:0.04, stark:0.04, still:0.04, superheroes:0.08, sure:0.05, takes:0.05, than:0.06, that:0.09, the:0.49, theater:0.11, there:0.03, these:0.07, thing:0.04, this:0.22, time:0.03, to:0.14, tony:0.04, too:0.04, universe:0.05, us:0.05, was:0.06, watch:0.03, we:0.04, what:0.08, whedon:0.03, will:0.03, with:0.04, would:0.06, written:0.06, year:0.05, yes:0.16, yet:0.05, you:0.07"

Looks like something from the movies of 20 years ago, cheap materials galore. I'm really surprised to see so many favorable reviews of this movie.

2012-05-06,"Joss Whedon finally gets an enormous budget to play with as he co-writes and directs this slab of super powered fun. Highly watchable from the first scene to the inevitable 'Easter Egg', Whedon made the crucial decision to please the fans. At no point during the mammoth 142 minutes play time does it feel unnecessarily dragged out. Robert Downey Jr. again excels as Tony Stark/Iron Man, however the other cast members deserve a lot of credit for not letting his performance overshadow theirs. Mark Ruffalo is near perfect as Bruce Banner/The (Incredible) Hulk, taking the role from Ed Norton who played the less than jolly green giant in his last big screen outing. As a friend said, 'At last they got Hulk right'. Indeed! The Hulk provides two moments of pure comedy, without insulting his mythos, a hurdle lots of comic hero adaptations fail to clear. CGI is used to enhance rather than substitute for plot, something other blockbusters should take note of. People unfamiliar with the Marvel characters could be confused as to who's who and why. But I'm sure after a little bit they'll be able to sit back and enjoy. There is a glaring continuity error though. In some scenes, the arc reactor in Stark's chest can clearly be seen glowing beneath his T-shirt, as it should be because if it wasn't glowing he'd be dead. Then in other scenes whilst Stark's in 'civvies' no arc reactor can be seen. In a film of this magnitude and budget this seems quite negligent. 'Avengers Assemble' will be the movie to beat of 2012 in terms of sheer entertainment. We saw it in I-Max which, unlike normal 3D is worth paying for.

2014-08-21,"Way back in 2008, Marvel decided to make a movie version of one of their lesser known comic book characters: Iron Man. Of course, we are now familiar with the character and the success Marvel have enjoyed but it was a bit of a risky move for them. What was even riskier was the idea that they would follow up with a number of origin movies for their other superheroes, before throwing them all into one huge summer blockbuster.It seemed destined to fail, such was its ambition, and yet, somehow, they have pulled it off. Avengers Assemble is not the best comic book movie ever made but it is probably the most fun. Marvel's biggest coup was hiring Joss Whedon to write and direct the movie. Whedon, who had already written a number of comic books before being asked to take on Avengers, is extremely comfortable with all of the characters, giving almost everyone a fair share of the runtime. One of the best things about Avengers Assemble is the dialogue; it is quite a feat to make a movie about a group of superheroes saving the world, and yet some of the best scenes are just two people talking. That is not to say there isn't some mind blowing action, with some of our childhood favourites slugging it out against each other before uniting against a common enemy, but it is often the verbal sparring which will have you grinning the widest.The cast are all on top form with Downey Jr. being the star attraction, but the best character in the whole movie is not human, and perhaps not even a superhero. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is an incredible feat, especially when you consider the previous incarnations of the character, and he is heavily involved in many of the movie's best scenes. Possibly the most ambitious project to come out of Hollywood since four hobbits set off to destroy a magical ring; Avengers Assemble is a resounding success, ticking all the right boxes and leaving you wanting more.",10.0,2014-08,Thursday,"about:0.08, action:0.03, against:0.13, all:0.10, almost:0.06, already:0.06, an:0.03, and:0.13, are:0.09, assemble:0.19, avengers:0.11, back:0.05, before:0.15, being:0.10, best:0.18, biggest:0.07, bit:0.06, blockbuster:0.06, book:0.10, but:0.10, cast:0.05, character:0.11, characters:0.06, come:0.05, comic:0.13, course:0.06, dialogue:0.06, downey:0.04, each:0.04, enjoyed:0.06, especially:0.06, even:0.08, ever:0.05, everyone:0.05, for:0.05, four:0.07, fun:0.05, giving:0.07, group:0.07, had:0.04, have:0.08, he:0.04, hollywood:0.07, huge:0.06, hulk:0.03, idea:0.07, in:0.07, incredible:0.05, into:0.04, iron:0.03, is:0.23, isn:0.06, it:0.14, its:0.04, joss:0.04, jr:0.04, just:0.03, made:0.04, make:0.09, man:0.03, many:0.04, mark:0.04, marvel:0.10, mind:0.06, more:0.03, most:0.08, movie:0.13, movies:0.03, not:0.11, now:0.05, of:0.29, off:0.10, on:0.06, one:0.08, other:0.08, our:0.07, out:0.07, people:0.05, previous:0.06, probably:0.06, quite:0.06, right:0.05, ruffalo:0.04, say:0.05, scenes:0.09, seemed:0.07, set:0.06, since:0.06, some:0.11, star:0.06, such:0.05, summer:0.07, superhero:0.04, superheroes:0.09, take:0.05, that:0.05, the:0.42, their:0.07, them:0.08, there:0.03, they:0.06, things:0.06, to:0.16, top:0.06, two:0.05, up:0.04, was:0.13, way:0.04, we:0.04, what:0.03, whedon:0.08, when:0.04, which:0.04, who:0.04, whole:0.06, will:0.04, with:0.12, world:0.05, would:0.04, written:0.07, yet:0.12, you:0.09"
2012-05-07,"I'm not sure if ""The Avengers"" is the best superhero movie ever, but I can't think of one that tops it! Big kudos to director Joss Whedon (screenplay), Zak Penn (script), and the other scribes for writing such an intelligent movie.This film is MUCH more than bad guy wants to beat the good guys and rule the world. The movie expertly weaves together plot elements of recent Marvel movies ""Thor"", ""Captain America"", and ""Iron Man 2"". I enjoyed how each of the Avengers had scenes that enhanced their characterizations. I appreciated how the tesseract/Cosmic Cube figured into different people's motivations for securing it, so as to do evil or do good. (And not everyone agrees about which is which).The dialogue in ""The Avengers"" is excellent. Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark/Iron Man) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) are especially good at delivering their lines.And what's a superhero movie without punches and explosions? The fight sequences are great and the special effects are fantastic! Congrats to the several hundred artists who made cities, landscapes, alien hordes, and the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier look so realistic.I will be seeing ""The Avengers"" again at a theater soon, and I'm already looking forward to Marvel Studios making ""Avengers 2"".

2012-05-08,"I am a relatively new convert to the world of Marvel. I did not grow up reading comic books, or knowing ANYTNIG about these iconic characters. My experience with Marvel began in 2008, when I first saw ""Iron Man"" in theaters, and fell in love with it. I was blown away by the level of storytelling and ESPECIALLY by Robert Downey Jr.'s phenomenal performance as Tony Stark. That movie shaped my idea of what storytelling and what movies could be. I kind of put that movie in the back of my mind for two years, but, when Iron Man 2 released in 2010, I TRULY began my love of Superhero movies. Over the next two years, I immersed myself in the Marvel universe. I have been blown away by Iron Man 2, Thor, AND Captain America: The First Avenger. All of those movies have been fantastic as stand alone movies. But, Joss Wheadon, the man who gave us the TV adaptation of ""Buffy The Vanpire Slayer"", ""Firefly"", and it's follow-up ""Sernity"", SOMEHOW finds a way to bring all these standalone characters and the elements of the past movies in the Marvel Universe and combines them perfectly together to make something wholly original, intelligent, and extremely breathtaking.After Loki (Tom Hiddelston) comes to Earth from the otherworldly kingdom of Asguard and decides that these new people, and this new planet, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the leader of a government agency called S.H.I.E.L.D., is forced to bring together the world's most powerful superheros, Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Dr. Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) together in order to combat his menace. Along with S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Natasah Romanov/Black Widow (Scarlett Johannsen) and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jermey Renner), the heroes must battle Loki's ""Army"".What makes this movie GREAT is the fact that the Avengers don't get along well, at ALL, when they first meet. Captain America and Iron Man take an immediate dislike to one another, and no one seems to like Thor, as he disagrees with Cap. and Iron Man on just about everything. These confrontations make for some of the FUNNIEST scenes in the movie. THis is a deeper, more philosophical and mature Super hero movie, while STILL being an entertaining, fun, popcorn movie, while STILL being the BEST Superrhero movie OF ALL TIME. This is more than JUST an action/adventure/popcorn movie. This is every sense of the term, a MASTERPIECE of filmmaking. I would say that this movie is worth seeing if you've seen ANY of the other Marbel films, or even if you've never seen the movies, Wheadon does a damn good job filling in all the blanks of the past movies perfectly for those who haven't seen them.

2012-05-07,"The avengers was a undeniably a movie that was more than what we had ever hoped for. The characters and the way all of them came together from their previous solo moves was exceptional. However, as far as the cast goes, I feel that some of them dominated over the others, perhaps because of the success of their solo manifestations. For those of u who have had a previous knowledge about the avengers plot, would know that CAPTAIN America was their all-in-all leader. However, he never got the recognition or position that he deserved. Like i said earlier, this should be because of the fact that out the entire lot, Iron man was the biggest hit Hollywood had got. But this undeniably changed the entire outlook of the Avengers team. Although towards the end of the movie, he gave some orders to the rest of his team, it still does not entirely prove the leadership of captain America. The Hulk who smashed his way into the Hollywood scene with a second comeback film also shared the lime light with his hilarious ""uncontrollable self"", and his total disregard to anyone, or anything that stood in his way of doing business.",9.0,2012-05,Monday,"about:0.05, all:0.10, also:0.05, although:0.08, america:0.10, and:0.05, anyone:0.09, anything:0.08, as:0.07, avengers:0.11, be:0.04, because:0.11, biggest:0.09, but:0.03, came:0.08, captain:0.10, cast:0.07, characters:0.04, does:0.06, end:0.07, entire:0.18, ever:0.06, fact:0.08, far:0.07, feel:0.07, film:0.04, for:0.06, from:0.04, goes:0.09, got:0.15, had:0.16, have:0.04, he:0.14, his:0.25, hollywood:0.19, however:0.15, hulk:0.04, in:0.06, into:0.06, iron:0.04, it:0.03, know:0.06, like:0.04, lot:0.06, man:0.04, more:0.05, movie:0.06, never:0.06, not:0.04, of:0.28, or:0.09, others:0.08, out:0.05, over:0.06, plot:0.06, previous:0.16, rest:0.09, said:0.08, scene:0.07, second:0.08, should:0.07, some:0.10, still:0.06, team:0.12, than:0.05, that:0.18, the:0.49, their:0.15, them:0.10, this:0.05, those:0.07, to:0.05, together:0.05, was:0.17, way:0.17, we:0.06, what:0.05, who:0.10, with:0.07, would:0.05"

The dialog is stupid, most of the costumes really lame, the story line completely predictable and good lord but the clichés run rampant. The ""super-villain"" has a British accent - that's about all you need to know about this movie. Most of the acting was completely forgettable or, in the case of Samuel L Jackson, just plain god-awful.

2012-04-28,"Amazing movie, It lives up to its hype.. Josh Whedon has done an amazing job of blending from all the solo movies and giving us the perfect taste which stands for me as the one of the best movies of 2012. He ensured that he has a role for each of the character, rather than focusing of few main characters only. Personally liked the character of iron man and Hulk. The best part is keeping humor hand to hand with the action scene, which ensures perfect entertainment for the viewer. Special effects were breathtaking and execution was seamless.

2012-05-02,"There is something to think about when we think that we have had movies where the characters were already presented to us. We walk in to the movie having knowledge of them, their personality, history etc. This makes for a great time saved in engaging the audience, and the impact is genius. The opportunity to make a good movie was not squandered. The Avengers is nothing less than the apex of mythology's evolution. The movie does not waste a moment exposing the audience to intense scenes from the beginning. The story is gripping, the enemy (Loki) chillingly relatable to in his human immaturity, and the heroes are a beautiful diversity of awesome. Real humans are fighting next to the superheroes ; effectively elevating Black Widow and Hawkeye to the rank of what Ancient Civilizations would call Gods. The Hulk is played perfectly and delivered intensely. He was my favorite character, though Captain America was pretty much like Jesus, less the miracles, plus the super abilities. He's the strategist, savior, gallant gentleman hero that's really an inspiring for the rest of the team and even for the audience. There are plenty of moments of comic relief, suspense, petty power hungry jealous Gods are crushed by humans. Most impressive was how suddenness was perfectly conveyed on screen. Where movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon accomplished impressive feets with wires on actors to make them look like they're flying/jumping, tricks were employed to make everything look as real as possible. At one point, Black Widow jump kicks a man with both feet landing on his chest and she fell on her back the same way you would if you tried in real life. When the Hulk punches Thor through the wall, the timing of the impact's shockwave is perfect and it looks freakishly real. It's a small detail that makes all the difference, the extra juice that makes the B grade an A. Of course, the scenes of destruction were beyond impressive, creative and awesome. I hadn't been so astounded in a very long time. Not since Die Hard 4! I also loved all the technology they used. Their daring vision is an inspiration for what we would like to atteign, if only in the display technology used by Stark and Banner! The movie was inspiring; I want to be a hero in my everyday way of being. Not that I am going to go and build an Iron Man suit (though I'd die for one), but the chivalry, nobility, and honor in being helpful, considerate, and empathic is very appealing. I don't want Director Fury's words of despair to be real for our world. ""We need heroes but ah, its an ancient notion"".

2012-05-17,"This was always going to be better than most summer blockbusters. Because it has continued from established successful films of the Iron Man series using Robert Downey Jr and although the Thor movie wasn't as good ( it had a lot to live up to) it was good enough and Tom Hiddleston'es Loki was an attractive feature for his exceptional performance.The saying is too many cooks spoil the cooking or such like or putting to many eggs in one basket which is the risk in this film as it is full of superheros about 8 has a film ever been loaded with so many? Inevtitably the film cannot go into detailed back story of each character. But the director does try to balance giving each character some previous life which explains leading to their current union.The reason why there has to be so many heroes all together is that Loki has a sinister plan and being a god it is more sinister than usual requiring the combined forces of many heroes to stand any chance of defeating him.What's the film actually like? Its the best adventure movie this year. As expected the CGI and special effects are top of the range, but thats doesn't stop Transformers from sucking. Its a proper director that makes a he difference. Joss Whedon directs this and has an amazing track record. What made his 'Buffy' memorable on television was the emphasis on writing and character. Its a cliché but the fact that he's British and not an American only interested in budget and what special effects can do may be the major factor.Whedon's writing and demanding that actors do actually act instead of being cardboard cutouts makes this movie better than any action adventure movie who will see this year. He includes the psychological factors that the team have very different personalities one of them exploding into green when a bit upset- Mark Ruffalo's Hulk which is the best performance since the 1970's television series. Hulk, Thor and Tony Stark are the one's who don't know what rules are and get things done their way. Why should a god listen to puny earthling laws? Tony Stark wouldn't be Stark if he didn't do things his own way.Captain America and the other names which people would be less familiar with unless they are Marvel fans follow protocols and command structures. Necessary for Captain American defending the American Way.The film is a success in every department technical, acting, writing and directing.

It was even better than what I had anticipated and every single person in the theater seemed to have had the time of their lives. There were plenty of laugh out loud moments where everyone just cheered and the movie never ceased to entertain. The Avengers is one of the best superhero movies ever made, and I would say only The Dark Knight surpasses it, although comparing these two movies isn't fair because this film is much lighter and self aware of its premise. The Avengers, directed by Joss Whedon (who also wrote the screenplay) is masterfully put together, meshing the incredible special effects and action scenes with the beloved characters and perfect cast. Everyone is really great in this film and it entertains from the very beginning. This is what a popcorn summer movie should be. I was worried so much hype for this film could've ruined the film for me, but I was wrong. All the hype only built the momentum for this great action comedy superhero flick. Ever since the first Iron Man came out these films (Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America, and The Incredible Hulk) have been a sort of teaser trailer for this big movie. Those films helped build the characters and build the momentum for what we truly wanted to see: The Avengers. I assume this is how kids actually felt during the early 50's when they were expecting for the next Marvel comic book issue to come out. This film definitely captured that essence and magic thanks to such a magnificent team of cast and crew. The movie opens with Loki (Tom Hiddleston) attacking the SHIELD agency directed by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) in order to retrieve the cube which would enable him to open a portal to another universe and send an army to destroy earth. Loki is successful and manages to steal the cube and force Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Dr. Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) to join him by taking away their free will. In order to stop Loki, Nick Fury decides it's time to assemble the team of superheroes which he has kept a close eye on for several years. He sends Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) to get Dr. Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) to call on Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.). Fury decides it's time to get Captain America (Chris Evans) back into the action, and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) comes all the way from Asgard to try to stop his villainous brother from destroying Earth. These superheroes are assembled together, but aren't ready to work as a team. They have some issues at first and have to learn to work together if they want to stop the evil Loki.The premise is pretty simple, but what really makes the film work is the interaction between all these great characters. This film could have relied so heavily on the special effects that it would've lost the magic of the great characters created by Stan Lee, but fortunately it decides to focus more on them. The tension they face working together is what really makes the movie work. There are plenty of funny moments as we have these superheroes fighting and mouthing each other. Robert Downey Jr. has showed us he can play the part to perfection, but every actor in this film really had great scenes. One of my greatest fears was that so many actors would not have enough screen time, but somehow everyone manages to be in this film for quite a while. Even minor characters such as Black Widow and Hawkeye get great exposure. Another thing I feared before The Avengers was that I thought Loki was one of the weakest villains of all the Marvel movies, but he is really great and dark in this film. He proved to be a great rival. But without a doubt, the best thing and most surprising for me was Mark Ruffalo's performance as The Hulk, he really owned the movie and he had the best and funniest scenes in the entire film. Pairing him with Downey Jr. was really the best thing the producers could have done. Hulk is perhaps the best character in this film and the one I was least expecting to enjoy. Everyone in the theater was truly satisfied with the film and especially with the Incredible Hulk. He was amazing and so was the movie for that matter. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",9.0,2012-04,Monday,"2012:0.03, action:0.04, actor:0.03, actors:0.03, actually:0.03, agent:0.04, all:0.06, along:0.03, also:0.02, although:0.03, amazing:0.02, america:0.03, an:0.02, and:0.26, another:0.05, are:0.03, army:0.06, as:0.05, assemble:0.03, at:0.02, avengers:0.06, away:0.03, back:0.03, banner:0.02, be:0.06, because:0.04, been:0.02, before:0.02, beginning:0.03, best:0.09, better:0.02, between:0.02, big:0.02, bit:0.03, black:0.04, book:0.02, brother:0.03, but:0.10, by:0.07, came:0.03, can:0.07, captain:0.04, cast:0.05, character:0.02, characters:0.08, chris:0.05, come:0.05, comedy:0.03, comes:0.03, comic:0.02, could:0.06, dark:0.05, definitely:0.03, didn:0.02, done:0.03, downey:0.06, each:0.02, earth:0.08, effects:0.04, enjoy:0.03, enough:0.03, entire:0.03, especially:0.03, evans:0.03, even:0.04, ever:0.04, every:0.04, everyone:0.10, evil:0.03, face:0.03, felt:0.03, fighting:0.03, film:0.19, films:0.06, first:0.04, for:0.13, from:0.05, funny:0.03, fury:0.07, get:0.06, great:0.13, greatest:0.03, had:0.08, has:0.03, have:0.11, hawkeye:0.04, he:0.14, hemsworth:0.03, hiddleston:0.03, him:0.07, his:0.02, how:0.02, hulk:0.06, hype:0.06, if:0.03, in:0.10, incredible:0.08, into:0.02, iron:0.03, is:0.12, isn:0.03, it:0.11, its:0.02, jackson:0.03, jeremy:0.03, johansson:0.03, joss:0.02, jr:0.06, just:0.02, knight:0.03, least:0.03, ll:0.03, loki:0.09, made:0.02, makes:0.05, man:0.03, many:0.04, mark:0.04, marvel:0.03, maybe:0.06, me:0.05, moments:0.05, more:0.02, most:0.04, movie:0.08, movies:0.05, much:0.06, my:0.03, never:0.02, next:0.03, nick:0.05, not:0.01, of:0.13, on:0.07, one:0.08, only:0.04, other:0.02, others:0.03, out:0.05, part:0.03, perfect:0.03, performance:0.03, play:0.03, pretty:0.03, put:0.03, quite:0.03, really:0.12, renner:0.03, robert:0.04, ruffalo:0.04, samuel:0.03, say:0.04, scarlett:0.02, scenes:0.06, screen:0.02, see:0.02, seemed:0.03, should:0.02, simple:0.03, since:0.03, single:0.03, so:0.06, some:0.02, special:0.05, stark:0.02, stop:0.09, such:0.05, summer:0.03, superhero:0.04, superheroes:0.07, sure:0.03, team:0.07, than:0.02, that:0.07, the:0.49, theater:0.06, their:0.04, them:0.02, there:0.03, these:0.11, they:0.06, thing:0.08, this:0.13, thor:0.03, those:0.02, thought:0.03, time:0.07, to:0.26, together:0.07, tom:0.02, tony:0.03, too:0.02, truly:0.07, two:0.03, universe:0.03, us:0.06, ve:0.05, very:0.02, want:0.03, was:0.16, way:0.02, we:0.08, were:0.04, what:0.08, whedon:0.02, when:0.02, where:0.02, which:0.04, while:0.03, who:0.02, widow:0.04, will:0.04, with:0.07, without:0.03, work:0.10, would:0.07, wrong:0.03, years:0.03, you:0.03, your:0.02"
2012-04-30,"The Avengers is a film like no other.Never have so many super heroes appeared on screen together.Often it is the case where a film suffers because of a huge star cast.But director Joss Whedeon has definitely done his homework and given each super hero a decent amount of screen time and build up ! The action scenes are flawlessly executed and are easy on the eyes unlike some recent action flicks these days.There are a few scenes in the movie that are insanely funny mostly involving Tony Stark and The Hulk.The story is nothing new,but the fact that it is carried out in such a linear and smooth fashion , makes it an amazing watch.Loki aka Thor's brother returns as the villain and does a good job at being bad.Nick Fury is decent.Scarlett Johansson looks sexy in Black playing the character of The Black Widow,only this time she has more screen time than what she got in Iron Man 2.Jeremy Renner is impressive as Hawkeye after his last hit MI : Ghost Protocol.In conclusion I think Avengers is the best action movie this year so far with mind blowing special effects and enough scenes to make you get out of you seat and applaud or maybe blow a whistle or two.It would be interesting to see if GI Joe Retaliation matches up to this when it releases in late June.",9.0,2012-04,Monday,"action:0.12, after:0.07, amazing:0.07, amount:0.10, an:0.05, and:0.22, are:0.16, as:0.08, at:0.05, avengers:0.08, bad:0.07, be:0.04, because:0.06, being:0.07, best:0.05, black:0.12, brother:0.09, but:0.07, cast:0.07, character:0.05, definitely:0.09, director:0.07, does:0.07, done:0.08, each:0.06, effects:0.06, enough:0.08, fact:0.09, far:0.08, few:0.08, film:0.09, funny:0.08, fury:0.07, get:0.06, given:0.09, good:0.05, got:0.08, has:0.10, have:0.04, hawkeye:0.07, hero:0.07, heroes:0.06, his:0.11, huge:0.09, hulk:0.04, if:0.05, impressive:0.11, in:0.19, interesting:0.09, iron:0.05, is:0.21, it:0.15, jeremy:0.08, job:0.08, johansson:0.08, joss:0.06, last:0.08, like:0.04, loki:0.05, looks:0.10, make:0.06, makes:0.07, man:0.05, many:0.06, maybe:0.09, mind:0.09, more:0.05, movie:0.06, never:0.07, new:0.07, nick:0.07, no:0.06, nothing:0.08, of:0.11, on:0.08, only:0.06, or:0.10, other:0.05, out:0.10, renner:0.08, scarlett:0.07, scenes:0.19, screen:0.20, see:0.05, she:0.19, so:0.09, some:0.05, special:0.07, star:0.09, stark:0.07, story:0.05, such:0.08, super:0.14, than:0.06, that:0.07, the:0.32, there:0.05, these:0.06, think:0.06, this:0.09, thor:0.05, time:0.15, to:0.08, together:0.06, tony:0.08, two:0.08, up:0.10, villain:0.07, watch:0.06, what:0.05, when:0.05, where:0.07, widow:0.06, with:0.04, would:0.06, year:0.09, you:0.08"
2012-05-01,"This eagerly awaited epic blockbuster didn't disappoint in the slightest. The big budget $220m movie directed by the relatively inexperienced director Joss Whedon (Buffy the vampire slayer and Serenity) incorporates the personal motives of every character in fighting a war that can only be won by the super powers that be.The film oozes coolness and the futuristic technology with leave the viewer smiling and connecting with each character. The plot of the movie revolves very much around fantasy with aspects of sci-fi which works well to ensure the hero's really are up against a challenge. There were areas which could have been better explained with regard to the villainous characters and where the portal came from. However, with a running time of 144 minutes you can certainly understand why it wasn't. The movie is rated 12A as it should be with no real violent scenes or swearing and a lot more humorous that initially expected.

For the rest, the movie is as funny as the first Iron Man movie. It's made with serious, but tongue-in-cheek humour. The cast in incredibly laughable. All the main characters are played by great actors, which is helping to support all the non-sense parts of the script. The craziest one is certainly Mark Ruffalo who's playing David Banner, a.k.a The Incredible Hulk. The man is always angry, and it takes a long time before we could see the deepness of his anger. But the waiting is good. The first part of the movie is just too slow, it takes too much time to start. As if the authors were trying too hard to explain every links with all the other Marvel movies made before. It's not always useful.

2015-04-30,"Any comic book movie - worth its salt far as budgets go - can give us terrific action with mind-blowing CGI and special effects. Marvel's The Avengers, the culmination of the work of five movies (one of them a sequel to the first, Iron Man), is stuffed with a good load of action and mayhem and a climax that bursts at the seams with aliens being torn apart by the heroes Captain America, Incredible Hulk, Thor and Tony Stark (plus relative newcomers Black Widow and Hawkeye, with Nick Fury and Agent Colson in the wings), and if you want to get your money shots, Joss Whedon doesn't skimp out. But the reason why he was chosen as the filmmaker here wasn't just for name cachet (though it probably helped).What Whedon's done over much of his career in TV and other films and webseries (Buffy, Firefly, Dr. Horrible, Angel, etc) was excel at bringing groups of people together against fantastical, supernatural, other-worldly/alien forces, but making it always about stakes, humor, horror, drama and solid conflicts. Villains don't just act nasty, they have their own logic and reasons for doing what they do, and if they're not sympathetic they certainly are understandable as characters, full of the stuff that makes them great to watch, especially with the best dialog probably out of anyone (i.e. the Mayor on Buffy, for those that recall).So here we get Loki, previously a villain in Thor (and later sort of brought back for Thor 2), and is by far the highlight of the film as Tom Hiddleston chews up scenery, but does it in a kind of elegant, theatrical, relishing way. By the time he spews out 'Muelling quim"", you're on the edge of your seat. His performance, what he does with every moment of screen time, is much more exciting than any alien snake going through the sky. And yet his ego and petty-mindedness does him in, and Whedon has a lot of fun writing this character, making him a threat but someone who can be taken down under the circumstances.This is one of the best of the Marvel films just by the way that Whedon goes about the sort of 'Ghostbusters/Ninja Turtles' formula - the four main players, each distinct, playing off one another, but things could turn on a dime any moment amid the jokes and this and that. Along with Hiddleston, Downey once again makes Tony Stark a helluva great character to take in as he is constantly thinking even as he is laying his sarcasm and deadpan on the other characters. And Johansson actually has a few really great scenes - Whedon has always written women characters as complex to the point that they put other ""complex"" male characters to shame - and somehow amid the many characters and plot turns going on, she stands out, especially Widow's scene with Loki. Ruffalo, too, does a lot with a little... until he gets to the ""other guy"".I don't know if Avengers is great art, but it does what I want to see when I go to big giant behemoth-like spectacles: provide me a host of characters who have to work together, and gives them interesting, entertaining and believable things to say. At 142 minutes it goes by at a great pace as well - not too fast, not too slow, nothing drags here, and that counts as well.

2012-05-02,"Joss Whedon is a genius! The ability to bring this cast and these characters together, and actually make a pretty phenomenal movie is a tremendous accomplishment. But even more than that, he was able to finally make ""the Hulk"" true to his comic book character (i.e. funny, and bad ass); he even made dull Captain America and Thor entertaining; but the true star of the film has to be Robert Downey Jr.!!!!! Without his comic relief in the first 2/3 of this film, this movie would have bombed miserably. I understand the importance of character development, but it's Tony Stark (Downey) who steals the show, and makes the film bearable.Kudos to Scarlett Johansson, her role as Black Widow, was really a thing of beauty. Strong female roles are hard to find in Hollywood, much less play with true abandonment; however, Johansson shines on the screen as the kick-ass siren. With any good action adventure, an evil antagonist, equally as wicked as his counterparts are good, must be pertinent to the film's plot to be a successful film. In this case, Tom Hiddleston reprises his role as Loki (Thor's evil half brother), as cements his role as screen villain extraordinaire.However, the crowning part of the whole film has to be the film's final 30 minutes. The ending battle of good vs evil is fantastic! The many one-liners come fast and furiously, and the action sequences are out of this world (literally)!!! At a cost of $220 million to make, you can definitely see it up on the screen! I am sure with salaries, percentage payoff to the actors and director (Josh Whedon); that it will be a very long time before Paramount sees any profits to this film; moreover, gathering all these stars again for a sequel is also highly unlikely. So enjoy this very entertaining bit of nostalgia while you can I highly recommend seeing this film; I would even suggest paying the additional cost to see it in IMAX. I am sure the ending battle sequence will be more that worth the cost of admission!!! The summer has started off with a BANG, let's hope the momentum continues!!!

2012-05-21,"In 2008, we were treated to a post-credits scene at the end of Iron Man, featuring Samuel L. Jackson making his first appearance as S.H.I.E.L.D. leader, Nick Fury. This small, minute long clip confirmed one thing; an Avengers movie was happening. So here we are. Four years, five films and one name change later, we have Avengers Assemble. So: was it worth the wait? In short; yes. Now, you'd think that in a film with so many big stars that some of them would end up being sent to the sidelines, but every single character gets their moment to shine. The only person that does feel a little underused is Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, but given his role in the story, it's understandable, and he still makes an impact. He could certainly give Katniss Everdeen a run for her money. The Hulk hasn't really had much luck when it comes to the big screen, currently on his third actor in just under ten years, but Joss Whedon and Mark Ruffalo have managed to bring the Hulk to the big screen in possibly the best way possible, and it's mostly all down to Ruffalo's damn good acting. He's the first actor to portray both Banner AND the ""Other Guy"" in the same film, and that's a major benefit to have the Hulk actually look like his human counterpart this time, whereas the versions from Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk and Louis Leterrier's 2008 The Incredible Hulk were both just a big, green CGI mess. Alas, there are some downsides to every film, and Avengers Assemble is no exception. The opening pre-credits scene does feel a little unsure, and the middle act drags a little bit. It was entertaining, but I did find myself wondering how long they were going to spend on the Helicarrier before something interesting happened. Finally, I arrive at the 3D. It wasn't particularly that impressive if I'm honest. I stopped noticing it after about twenty minutes (though that probably proves just how good the film was) apart from in a select few scenes, and even then, the screen is too jumbled. Every time you blink, your eyes need to re-adjust to the image, and it becomes blurry. I'd say that, if you have the extra money, go for 3D, but if you opt for a 2D viewing, you won't miss much, and you'll save some money!

2012-04-27,"Where to begin?! The Avengers is where multiple superheroes come together to go against one force. From a fan's point of view, the movie hit the spot especially considering that there were references to events which occurred in comic books which were not previously filmed. From my point of view, a non-fanatic yet sucked into the hype,I had the inclination to watch those movies, which I hadn't watched yet, with the superheroes in the Avengers and trust me it was worth it! Apart from the fact that a viewer would not know a particular superhero's past, there is a minute back story which is worth noting from the previous movies so as to feel at ease with the continuation of the story which is seen in The Avengers.Casting was appropriate as most were from the previous films but even roles such as the one which Cobie Smulders (some of you may know her as Robin from ""How I Met Your Mother"") played, though small, were significant. Screenplay cannot be argued and the fact that this movie had a USP of 3D motion picture, the effect changed the experience.Action is dominant in this film but with numerous combinations of enemies, as not all fights are against 'the bad guy' in particular, it is exciting as well as interesting with the question of not only who is going to win, but how? Comedy, interestingly, was present, I feel mainly because of Robert Downey Jr. but others were important factors.This movie was not very dialogue-heavy but more straight to the point. Script-wise, the dialogues were indeed effective as well as pulsating for the the viewer.With an approx 2hr 30min running time, there are hardly any parts which one would find unnecessary and although it may appear as a one-time-watch there are particular scenes which really make you look for them on Youtube and such.With bursts of excitement at random intervals and sometimes loads of adrenaline in more than just a couple of scenes, The Avengers took me by surprise, and I hope it does the same to you.P.S.

2012-05-08,"The first of the two most highly anticipated superhero films of the summer is here, and it doesn't disappoint. The Avengers more than makes up for the last few disappointing summer movie seasons we've had. I don't think I've had this much fun at a movie since Pixar's Up. This two and a half hour movie never fails to excite.The plot is standard superhero movie fare. Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor's evil step brother, breaks out of prison with the aid of a race of super evil aliens. Loki proceeds to steal a super weapon from the realm of Asgard (Thor's universe) and threatens the world. Nick Fury, in a routine performance by Samuel L. Jackson, must assemble a team of superheroes to combat Loki: Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, replacing Ed Norton), the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Loki unleashes his evil army on New York city and the Avengers must do what they always do- kick butt.Marvel was truly clever to give these characters their own individual franchises before making an Avengers movie, and not just in a financial sense. Since we all know these characters already, the movie doesn't suffer from ""too many characters syndrome,"" unlike another Marvel franchise about a superhero team (Marvel fans know what I mean). Each character's story continues in The Avengers and it feels perfectly natural. It is the chemistry of this cast that really makes this film work. Personalities clash until the gravity of the situation sits in and they start to cooperate. Predictably, by the end of the film they are all friends, but why complain? It's all in good fun.Given that these are really second tier superheroes in the Marvel Comics gallery, (sorry Avengers fans, but Spider-Man and X-Men are higher up in the hierarchy), I am amazed that they were adapted to film so well. All of these Avengers movies pulled off their protagonists VERY well, but they have slightly weak antagonists, and this movie is no exception. Loki is a decent character and Hiddleston is a decent enough actor, but he just doesn't have the dramatic weight to match the power of the Avengers.A review wouldn't be complete without some description of the action. As expected, it's fantastic from a technical standpoint, but it's extra fun because you care about the characters so much (maybe that's just me). I personally could have used more Bruce Banner/Incredible Hulk moments- I felt he was really overshadowed by the other teammates. Ruffalo was at a disadvantage because he was taking over for Edward Norton. But the Incredible Hulk scenes are GREAT- easily my favorite action moments.I must say this is probably my favorite Marvel superhero movie because it's just so fun. It doesn't need to get bogged down in character moments- it is just a shameless roller coaster ride. So go see the Avengers. It is the first action flick of what looks like to be a very promising summer for action movies.

2012-05-14,"The Avengers Movie - I don't really know what to expect. Massive disasters, huge rescue team. At first I don't really like the team up of Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, HULK, Hawkeye, and Black Widow in a squad against the naughty God of Loki. It is very true for a fictional movie to be irrational and illogical in some part of it, but the combination itself seemed weird, especially they came from a very different time and dimensions. Though it was explained very briefly in the movie, I still can't find it successful to convince me with it. I quite excited with the first 60minutes when the team was built up again, with all conflicts and funny stuffs. Thanks to Mr. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) for his sense of humor. Actions were of course, as expected. You could never get enough of it. Though I might afraid you gonna find it somehow too 'easy' somehow, some part of it. My favorite character certainly goes to Miss Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) with her witty techniques of interrogation. The cast was used very wisely. They played a very beautiful role in this movie. Storyline of every superheroes movie wasn't really worth discuss for. Good versus evil, justice win over the bad guy's plan and etc. Two things I like the most are the enough time (141minutes) with no boredom, and when the teammates were scattered all around. But I don't really think when the superhero music played and they assembled with Capt. Steve Rogers took the lead was the climax that we really wanted to watch. Old-fashioned, and too usual. And I believe the ending wasn't that satisfying too. It was very entertaining though. Worth every penny. And I don't know, may be it's still one of the best movie in this year. Should get almost 5.

He left me wanting more from the relationship of black widow and hawkeye.Now I'm not saying this is a perfect film but it definitely surpasses the previous attempts of team of superheroes, i.e. X-men and the Fantastic Four. Some characters left me wanting more... yes I'm talking about you Mark Ruffalo. I felt like I was watching another one of his lame romantic comedies every time he was on the screen. Don't get me started on the Mark Ruffalo's stuff face on the hulk. Give me the big green monster from the Incredible Hulk and I would be closer to a 10 than a 9 for this movie.All things considered, this movie went by in a flash with all the brilliant action sequences and the great script writing. I can't wait for the next avengers film. It should be incredible if Joss Whedon is involved. Marvel/Disney don't let that man go because you have no chance unless you can get Chris Nolan to do Spiderman for you because we all know that is going to be a let down.",9.0,2012-05,Tuesday,"10:0.07, about:0.05, action:0.04, all:0.17, and:0.13, another:0.07, at:0.04, avengers:0.04, be:0.16, because:0.12, big:0.12, black:0.06, brilliant:0.09, but:0.07, by:0.05, can:0.09, characters:0.04, chris:0.07, definitely:0.08, do:0.06, don:0.11, down:0.08, every:0.06, face:0.10, fantastic:0.08, felt:0.08, film:0.12, for:0.10, four:0.10, from:0.09, get:0.11, give:0.07, go:0.06, going:0.14, great:0.09, had:0.11, have:0.04, hawkeye:0.06, he:0.15, his:0.05, hulk:0.08, hype:0.09, if:0.05, in:0.03, incredible:0.15, iron:0.04, is:0.08, it:0.14, joss:0.11, just:0.04, know:0.06, left:0.19, let:0.17, like:0.04, man:0.09, mark:0.12, marvel:0.05, me:0.20, more:0.09, movie:0.09, my:0.05, next:0.08, no:0.05, not:0.04, now:0.07, of:0.13, on:0.12, one:0.04, perfect:0.07, previous:0.08, put:0.08, ruffalo:0.12, screen:0.06, script:0.08, sequences:0.08, should:0.07, some:0.05, stars:0.09, stuff:0.10, superheroes:0.06, team:0.06, than:0.05, that:0.06, the:0.35, things:0.08, this:0.11, time:0.05, to:0.13, together:0.05, up:0.05, wait:0.09, was:0.14, watching:0.07, we:0.12, went:0.09, whedon:0.11, when:0.05, who:0.10, widow:0.06, with:0.03, would:0.10, writing:0.09, yes:0.09, you:0.15"

2013-03-31,"There was a lot of hype and build up leading up to this movie for the past few years, and it has finally come and I will say it has lived up to its hype.This movie deals with Thor's brother Loki trying to take over the earth by harnessing the Tesseract, an energy source with immense power. Nick Fury then assembles Iron Man, Bruce Banner, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, and Hawkeye to stop him.The movie starts out a little slow, and the plot is very simple, bad guy wants to take over the world and will do nothing to stop until he does. It's clichéd but still pays off because of the amount of action. The violence itself is cartoon like, so it is safe for all ages.One other issue I had was the Hulk only has two appearances in this movie, but in each he is the best hero to watch and definitely makes this movie awesome. Mark Ruffalo also has given the best performance as Bruce Banner yet seen in movies, he has far surpasses Eric Bana and Edward Norton.Joss Whedon understood this movie is about giving audiences what they want to see with lots of Marvel superhero's in one movie, thrilling action sequences, humor and pure entertainment.This isn't a perfect movie but it is still a lot of fun to watch and even if your not a comic book fan you will still like this film, definitely give this a watch.",9.0,2013-03,Sunday,"about:0.05, action:0.07, all:0.03, also:0.05, america:0.04, amount:0.09, an:0.04, and:0.23, as:0.03, awesome:0.06, bad:0.06, banner:0.12, because:0.05, best:0.09, black:0.05, book:0.06, brother:0.07, bruce:0.13, but:0.09, by:0.04, captain:0.04, come:0.06, comic:0.05, definitely:0.15, do:0.05, does:0.06, each:0.05, earth:0.07, entertainment:0.08, even:0.05, fan:0.06, far:0.07, few:0.07, film:0.04, finally:0.07, for:0.06, fun:0.06, fury:0.06, give:0.07, given:0.08, giving:0.09, guy:0.07, had:0.05, has:0.21, hawkeye:0.06, he:0.13, hero:0.06, him:0.06, hulk:0.04, humor:0.07, hype:0.16, if:0.04, in:0.11, iron:0.04, is:0.15, isn:0.07, it:0.12, its:0.05, itself:0.08, joss:0.05, like:0.08, little:0.06, loki:0.05, lot:0.12, makes:0.06, man:0.04, mark:0.05, marvel:0.04, movie:0.22, movies:0.04, nick:0.06, norton:0.08, not:0.03, nothing:0.07, of:0.12, off:0.06, one:0.07, only:0.05, other:0.05, out:0.04, over:0.11, past:0.09, perfect:0.07, performance:0.08, plot:0.06, power:0.08, ruffalo:0.05, say:0.06, see:0.04, seen:0.05, sequences:0.07, simple:0.08, so:0.04, still:0.18, stop:0.16, superhero:0.05, take:0.13, tesseract:0.09, the:0.25, then:0.06, there:0.04, they:0.04, this:0.20, thor:0.08, to:0.22, two:0.07, until:0.08, up:0.13, very:0.05, want:0.07, wants:0.09, was:0.06, watch:0.14, what:0.04, whedon:0.05, widow:0.05, will:0.14, with:0.09, world:0.06, years:0.06, yet:0.07, you:0.04, your:0.06"

2012-05-01,"A movie some four years in the making, from the post-credit teaser of 2008's excellent Iron Man and 2010 sequel, through last year's equally impressive though very different Thor and Captain America movies. The weight of expectation is often a tough one to bear, with the question being could the bringing together of these stories and characters hope to equal the sum of the parts? As a long time comic book fan I would have to say the answer is a resounding ""yes"". In fairness I did have good reason to hope - Joss Whedon is a long time Marvel comics writer, and his speciality is ensemble characters. As with the highly successful Buffy and Angel franchises he has a talent for gel'ing an aparrently incongruous group - exploring the conflicts between the characters with humour to bring them together. Even the relatively underdeveloped characters - Mark Ruffalo as the new Banner / Hulk, Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye, and Scarlett Johanssen's Black Widow are fleshed out and given fair screen time, each essential to the plot in their own way. Nick Fury and his team of Shield agents also play their part, while Tom Hiddleston's return as the arrogant demi-god Loki provides ample threat, with the feeling of something darker lurking in the wings - make sure you wait for the inevitable post-credit teaser for a clue as to what. True, the movie does rely heavily on super-powered set pieces, from the clashes of egos (and fists, hammers, shields and repulsors) within the group to the incredible city-wrecking finale, but what else would you expect or hope from in a movie like this? From the action-packed set-pieces and great one-liners through to the human interactions Avengers Assembles all of the parts and proves the whole to be greater than the sum.",10.0,2012-05,Tuesday,"action:0.03, all:0.03, also:0.04, america:0.04, an:0.03, and:0.25, are:0.03, as:0.17, avengers:0.03, banner:0.05, be:0.03, being:0.05, between:0.06, black:0.05, book:0.05, bring:0.07, but:0.03, captain:0.04, characters:0.14, comic:0.05, comics:0.06, could:0.05, did:0.05, different:0.06, does:0.05, each:0.05, else:0.07, ensemble:0.08, even:0.04, excellent:0.07, expect:0.07, fan:0.06, for:0.08, four:0.08, from:0.14, fury:0.05, given:0.07, god:0.06, good:0.04, great:0.04, group:0.14, has:0.04, have:0.06, hawkeye:0.05, he:0.04, hiddleston:0.06, highly:0.07, his:0.08, hope:0.22, hulk:0.03, humour:0.08, impressive:0.08, in:0.12, incredible:0.06, iron:0.04, is:0.09, jeremy:0.06, joss:0.04, last:0.06, like:0.03, loki:0.04, long:0.12, make:0.05, making:0.06, man:0.03, mark:0.05, marvel:0.04, movie:0.07, movies:0.04, new:0.06, nick:0.05, of:0.17, on:0.03, one:0.06, or:0.04, out:0.04, own:0.06, packed:0.07, part:0.06, parts:0.15, play:0.07, plot:0.05, reason:0.07, renner:0.06, ruffalo:0.05, say:0.05, scarlett:0.05, screen:0.05, sequel:0.07, set:0.13, some:0.04, something:0.06, super:0.05, sure:0.06, team:0.05, than:0.04, the:0.54, their:0.08, them:0.04, these:0.05, this:0.02, thor:0.04, though:0.06, through:0.12, time:0.11, to:0.21, together:0.08, tom:0.06, true:0.07, very:0.04, wait:0.07, way:0.05, what:0.08, whedon:0.04, while:0.06, whole:0.06, widow:0.05, with:0.11, would:0.08, year:0.06, years:0.06, yes:0.07, you:0.06"
2012-05-04,"We waited a long time for this movie. An extremely long time. After years of waiting (Have I emphasized the waiting part yet?), years of hits (Iron Man, Thor), misses (The Incredible Hulk) and disappointments (Iron Man 2) we get the long-awaited reunion of all of the (accessible to Disney) Marvel heroes that eventually form the league of heroes known as the Avengers. This film is blockbuster fanfare at its finest, as this will please the newbie new-school Marvel fans as well as your hardcore old-schoolers.The Avengers' plot is very straightforward, very simple. Loki (you know him from Thor) has arrived in the United States and steals this ultra-powerful sphere to attempt to take over the entire planet. Your classic comic book tale. Nick Fury attempts to unite several of the well-known superheroes that had remained under the watch of SHIELD over the years in order to bring Loki to intergalactic justice. It's a good ol' good vs. evil plot that paces like a comic book in terms of withholding the juicy content until the final act.What makes this movie work is the superb script that is full of one-liners, full of complex interactions between our heroes that all come from very different backgrounds, and contains more than enough room to allow for action and mayhem to conquer the screen. Joss Whedon's style can clearly be heard through the dialogue, and his rabid cult following (which is the strongest in media aside from Tarantino) will devour every moment of it.What also makes this movie work is the phenomenal amount of action that you'll see from the beginning to the end. Plenty of fights, plenty of carnage, plenty of heroes working together, and best of all they make up for the recent Marvel movies that had been sorely lacking in material. Every hero has their moment to shine, from the fan favorite Iron Man to even the weaker Hawkeye. And Hulk gets to smash, a lot, and boy does he deliver in ways you wouldn't expect. An added bonus is that our heroes despite having flaws and limitations are definitely likable enough for you to root for them—even the Hulk, who had been extremely poorly characterized over the yea-decades in media. You have the great acting ensemble to thank for that.But....The Avengers is a great movie, don't get me wrong, it will be worth your pennies. But, you can tell they were quite limited.Part of the appeal of The Avengers comic books were the cameo surprises and supervillians as well as the heroes. Instead, we have a villain that already was featured in a prior movie as well as nameless faceless boring baddies. And no cameos. One can only imagine if Disney actually pushed for the ability to bring in the Marvel characters already owned by other movie companies. Then, the potential will explode and reach levels of awesomeness that we see only in the comic books.And for those of you that tell me movie companies working together is not possible, I bring Exhibit A: Who Framed Roger Rabbit---A Disney movie.If we ever were to see The Avengers reach its full potential, we need to see Hollywood work together and be willing to bend a few rules.

2012-04-27,"The Avengers is the best summer blockbuster for a long time, it balances all elements of fun, drama, action, special effects, multiple egos into a well directed, paced movie. The film has perfectly edited action set pieces, no fast editing like say transformers and it benefits hugely. The first 30 minutes are fairly slow build up, but after that the last hour especially is amazing. Credit has to go to the director, you really can tell he has a love for the source material and gets all the characters to interact and each share their own moments throughout the film. The drama is not as dark as say the dark knight. As people have been saying it is a very funny film with some laugh out moments. The Avengers is simply amazing, Hollywood is in for a bumper year this year with so many high profile releases yet to come, The Dark Knight Rises, Spider-Man, Skyfall, The Hobbit. The Avengers has started the summer blockbuster season with a bang and may end up being the best of them all in 2012.

2012-08-26,"Looks like another parallel universe version of the Avengers. In the original comic, Hulk was on a rampage, and they got together to stop him. In this version, they got together to stop Loki.So, truly all star cast assembled to make this much anticipated movie. I like the fact that all the actors really look their part except Nick Fury. He kept reminding me of all things, the Red Skull.It's difficult to come up with an enemy that's big enough to warrant an Avengers assemble. Joss Whedon was the first director to successfully direct the motion of the Hulk. Hulk looked most realistic in this movie. He also must have been a long time Marvel comic fan, because all the other characters' best moves were captured in this movie.I liked Captain America in this movie lot more than the Captain America movie.

2012-05-10,"GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!! Like, right now. Just drop everything, and go see this movie!!! It is 100% worth it.When Loki, the god of mischief who we saw in ""Thor,""played by Tom Hiddleston, threatens the safety of the world, SHIELD director Nick Fury, played by Samuel L. Jackson, brings together a team of superheroes, most of which come from the last few Marvel superheroes movies: Iron Man, played brilliantly once again by Robert Downey Jr., Captain America, played by Chris Evans, The Incredible Hulk, played by Mark Ruffalo (taking over for Edward Norton), Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth, Black Widow, played by the beautiful Scarlett Johansson, and Hawkeye, played by Jeremy Renner. Together, they must stop Loki from initiating his plan.Let me just say this as my starting point for the review: A movie about a team of superheroes is always risky to make, the risk being that perhaps one of the superheroes will get the short end of the stick. Well, I can easily say that each one of the Avengers get their own scenes, their own stories, and their own moments. In other words, thank God for Joss Whedon and his team for coming up with a script in which everyone plays a good part of the story in some way.Now the actors: Each one of them does a very good job in their role. Samuel L. Jackson, as always, is very good as Nick Fury. Tom Hiddleston really knows how to deliver the bad guy character, especially when it comes to the Norse god of mischief. Jeremy Renner is great as Hawkeye, as is Scarlet Johansson as Black Widow. You can tell that there is something between the two characters. Chris Hemsworth is great as Thor, and Mark Ruffalo proves that he is one of the better actors when portraying Bruce Banner/The Hulk. Chris Evans is great as Captain America, and of course, like I said, Robert Downey Jr brilliantly plays the Iron Man character well. Just seeing someone so noble like Captain America argue with someone really arrogant and cocky like Iron Man is always a pleasure to watch.As for the action sequences and the special effects: do I really even need to comment on this part? This is the reason why you are seeing this movie (or at least the main reason). You want to see these guys battle it out in awesome battle sequences, which they do. The 3d, believe it or not, is actually pretty good in those sequences, specifically when something blows up and debris is flying everywhere and when Hawkeye's arrows go toward the screen.All in all, a really great movie. Joss Whedon, we trusted you and you did not let us down, buddy. If you want, I'll get you a beer and we can talk about the sequel (speaking of which, stay after the credits). The Avengers lives up to the excitement, with a script that never loses the heroes compassion, and with great action sequences.

2012-05-21,"There was no secret of the highly populated cast in the lead up to the Avengers, taking into account the hype since the release of Iron Man in 2008. The success of Iron man was followed by a sequel in 2010. Fans of the Super Hero franchise where greeted with the release of two more comic book movies, Thor and Captain America. The question was, could the Avengers succeed as a whole? Nick Fury (Jackson) recruits Iron Man (Downey Jr), Thor (Hemsworth), and Captain America (Evans) as well as newcomer Mark Ruffalo as the HULK! The super group also consists of two newbies to the big screen, Black Widow is played Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye (The next Bourne?) The world is under threat following the arrival of Loki, a citizen of Asgard, another Universe (Thor 2011). Loki is the brother of Thor, although both would agree the distance between them is not exaggerated. It is Loki's attack on S.H.I.E.L.D that leads to a crucial decision by Nick Fury, leader of the affiliation. The desperate attempt involves regrouping something stronger than Loki and his army of Cohorts, The Avengers! The movie has a nice feel to it with a brilliant intro of what's to come. Those who have not seen previous movies won't suffer too much but it does consist of some flashbacks regarding Captain America.The storyline is put together smartly and manages to keep the balance in relation to the numerous egos on board. As Loki is the one at large it feels the story is based off of Thor but does well in blending all characters. As always, Robert Downey shows class as the arrogant, yet hilarious Tony Stark and the ever so cheesy Captain America (Evans). Fans will enjoy the rivalry between both Captain America and Iron man, as personalities quickly collide before they realize the moral of the story is team-work.The return of Loki was a great choice as he made for a terrific bad-guy in Thor and the collision between family is still fun to watch. Although Loki seemed a handful in the release of Thor in 2010, Nick Fury and the Avengers get caught completely off guard with Loki and his mind boggling army! The introduction of a third Bruce Banner is, unfortunately frustrating for some. But when the Hulk is transformed, nobody notices. Yes, a third. Mark Ruffalo plays the man with the temper. Following Eric Bana and Edward Norton (My favorite by the way), Mark Ruffalo as Dr Banner had a challenge on his hands. Is there information on why Edward Norton was not included instead? I believe if he was, performance on the bases of acting would have been better than Mark Ruffalo. But just like I said, in relation to the Avengers, fans just want to see the Hulk tear people, buildings and valuable things apart! and that is just what he does! My favorite was Bruce Banner...when he was green.My knowledge in Marvel limits, but I wonder what fans made of Hawk-eye and Black Widow? Both characters, like the rest were highly entertaining. Jeremy Renner is leading an exciting future and Scarlett Johansson...well, just do what you do best!... Not forgetting Samuel Jackson, even though he has been forgettable in the past. He gives fans an enjoyable performance, curse free. Mr Jackson just needs to choose his movies carefully in my opinion. He has been in some woeful movies lately.The action and CGI makes the Avengers what it is. In comparison to Captain America (Which I despised) and even the previous CGI Hulk, this blows them out of the water. You noticed I excluded Both the Iron Man and Thor movies, the Avengers is still early release and is yet to be decided, in my opinion.The Avengers is up there with the greatest super hero movies ever made. Audience from generations will enjoy the Avengers. Whether you are unfortunate to see this movie in 3D or stay classy with 2D, one must see immediately! The Exciting question for the future is, What is next to come? Well we know Iron Man 3 and a Thor sequel is in writing. Unfortunately Captain America also, and possibly a new Bruce Banner? who knows. In relation to an Avengers Sequel? now that's getting carried away!Did you enjoy my review? check out my previous and up to date reviews at my blog - http://gerrysreviewsforthosecurious.blogspot.com/",10.0,2012-05,Monday,"3d:0.03, acting:0.02, action:0.01, all:0.01, also:0.04, although:0.06, always:0.03, america:0.12, an:0.05, and:0.20, another:0.03, are:0.01, army:0.06, as:0.14, at:0.03, audience:0.03, avengers:0.13, away:0.03, bad:0.02, banner:0.10, be:0.01, been:0.06, before:0.02, believe:0.03, best:0.02, better:0.02, between:0.08, big:0.02, black:0.04, book:0.02, both:0.12, brilliant:0.03, brother:0.03, bruce:0.08, but:0.06, by:0.05, captain:0.12, cast:0.02, cgi:0.05, characters:0.03, come:0.05, comic:0.02, could:0.02, did:0.02, do:0.04, does:0.07, downey:0.04, enjoy:0.08, entertaining:0.03, evans:0.05, even:0.04, ever:0.04, exciting:0.07, fans:0.13, favorite:0.06, feel:0.03, feels:0.03, for:0.04, franchise:0.03, from:0.02, fun:0.02, fury:0.07, get:0.02, getting:0.03, great:0.02, greatest:0.04, group:0.03, guy:0.03, had:0.02, has:0.05, have:0.03, hawkeye:0.02, he:0.12, hemsworth:0.03, hero:0.05, highly:0.07, his:0.07, hulk:0.06, hype:0.03, if:0.02, in:0.19, instead:0.03, into:0.02, iron:0.10, is:0.22, it:0.05, jackson:0.08, jeremy:0.05, johansson:0.05, jr:0.02, just:0.08, keep:0.03, know:0.02, like:0.03, loki:0.15, made:0.06, makes:0.02, man:0.11, mark:0.09, marvel:0.02, mind:0.03, more:0.02, movie:0.02, movies:0.10, much:0.02, must:0.03, my:0.13, new:0.02, next:0.06, nice:0.03, nick:0.07, no:0.02, norton:0.06, not:0.05, now:0.02, of:0.20, off:0.05, on:0.07, one:0.03, opinion:0.07, or:0.02, out:0.03, past:0.03, people:0.02, performance:0.06, played:0.03, previous:0.09, put:0.03, renner:0.05, rest:0.03, review:0.03, reviews:0.03, robert:0.02, ruffalo:0.09, said:0.03, samuel:0.03, scarlett:0.05, screen:0.02, see:0.05, seemed:0.04, seen:0.02, sequel:0.10, since:0.03, so:0.02, some:0.05, something:0.03, stark:0.03, still:0.05, story:0.04, storyline:0.03, super:0.07, team:0.02, than:0.04, that:0.03, the:0.51, them:0.04, there:0.05, they:0.02, things:0.03, this:0.02, thor:0.15, those:0.03, though:0.03, to:0.16, together:0.02, tony:0.03, too:0.02, two:0.05, universe:0.03, up:0.05, want:0.03, was:0.10, watch:0.02, way:0.02, we:0.02, well:0.07, were:0.02, what:0.10, when:0.04, where:0.02, which:0.02, who:0.04, whole:0.03, why:0.03, widow:0.04, will:0.04, with:0.07, won:0.03, work:0.03, world:0.02, would:0.04, writing:0.03, yes:0.03, yet:0.06, you:0.06"
2012-04-28,"All I could think of as the end credits rolled was, MORE PLEASE!!! I would gladly have turned around and watched it again!The Avengers is not a deep thinking film. You will not leave the theater enlighted or confused. It won't cause you to re-think your world or your ideals, it won't be a debate provoking film amongst your other intellectual friends... but it WILL leave you thoroughly entertained!!! Those who are not of the genre will call it ""mindless banter"" and scoff at it. Those who are OK with being transported temporarily to a place where they can forget everything for 2 1/2 hours and just enjoy it, they will love it!The previous movies have given substance, background and depth to the characters (most of them). They feel familiar and ""make sense"". The story line is simple and predictable, Evil returns, wants to enslave Earth, team of superheroes assembles and drive evil away... or do they? (stay through the ending credits, trust me).It's not the ""super story"" that keeps you glued to your chair. It is everything else. Somehow you are not the slightest bit annoyed (or care for) the predictability of the story. I don't think a better director could have been chosen for this film.

2012-04-28,"A culmination of several movie franchises, THE AVENGERS certainly delivers. There could have been many ways that the studios could have screwed this movie up but they chose the right director: Joss Whedon (former helmer of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly on TV as well as an actual comic book writer for Marvel Comics). Whedon knows his stuff and he creates what is probably the most compatible comic book movie ever; the whole film reads as if it was an actual Marvel comic book!Whedon subtly melds the disparate elements from multiple other comic book movies and effortlessly creates an epic storyline that makes sense. The tesseract (known to comic fans as the cosmic cube) that was the focal plot point of CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER (2011) has been recovered and being studied closely by the government when Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the villain of the previous THOR (2011) movie appears and takes control of it. In response, Col. Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson, in his usual badass self) decides to form a small but lethal response team: Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye and Thor. If they can get along and work together then they might have a chance to save the world.Being the top billed character because of box-office receipts, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) gets the best lines and almost steals the entire show. His wisecracks upends the traditional leader of the Avengers, Captain America (Chris Evans, playing the straight man to everyone else) and puts the latter character in a disadvantage- the movie's lone weakness is that Cap doesn't get to do much other than act as a foil to the larger than life Tony Stark. Thor (Chris Helmsworth) does shine in the few scenes in which he is at front and center while both Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) give much needed humanity since they are the only members of the team that don't have superpowers. But the one character that makes the most impact of his limited screen time is Mark Ruffalo, who plays the volatile Hulk- Ruffalo plays Bruce Banner as a smoldering Stanley Kowalski, always seemingly in control yet has a temper like nitroglycerine- his Banner is different from the brooding Eric Bana of 2003's HULK or the timid Edward Norton of THE INCREDIBLE HULK (2008); you don't get to see much of Ruffalo compared to the others but his character is the most intriguing of all. Hiddleston is adequate as the pouty, scheming Loki but you can't help but believe that he is simply outgunned with all these powerhouses surrounding him.The movie is almost perfect but does fail to take chances with their characters. Evan's Captain America is a direct copy from the mainstream comic book but you wished he might have been given more of an edge, like the Ultimate Marvel incarnation of Captain America: a slightly racist do-gooder who prefers to smash heads when someone doesn't measure up to his 1930's morality. If only the movie had been longer there might have been more insight into his character but with this film running over 2 ½ hours it might have been a systematic one.In the end though, there is something for everyone in this movie, from the constant action scenes to the quiet ones that add humanity to what would otherwise be cardboard clichés.

2013-03-27,"This movie is retarded. Humanity must have seriously degraded if people consider this piece of crap the best of the best in cinema. I can't believe this movie is just two points away from the same rating for scarface. That movie was awesome, not this piece of crap. I think the movie order should go like this; #1 The Godfather, #2 Scarface, #3 Star Wars Episode VI Return Of The Jedi, #4 Alien, #5 Titanic. Those movies are legendary, but this movie? This movie is no where near legendary. I would rate this movie a zero but since i can't pick that i guess i'll go with one star. This movie has the most predictable plot ever, to sum it up it goes like this; bam boom bam boom, cheesy dialogue cheesy dialogue, bam boom bam boom, cheesy dialogue cheesy dialogue, bam boom bam boom, the end. The dialogue is some of the corniest crap in film history. Batman And Robin was corny and stupid, but at least it was tolerable with Arnold's witty one-liners.

I saw this at the cinema (not in 3D) and I really enjoyed it. The way I put the trailer clips together into a story in went completely a different way which I was glad of. I enjoyed how they did it and how they brought them together and how they disagree and then find out they need each other. There are a few twists in this that I really wasn't expecting. The dialogue in this movie absolutely awesome and so funny, more jokes and hilarious quips than I expected which were really good. I'm glad it wasn't really bad and it was the complete opposite as there are no origin stories and it's just The Avengers. Even people who haven't seen the rest of the MCU I think will enjoy it as there isn't much depth and a lot is explained like why the Hulk is why he is and how they found Cap alive; so with very slight back stories and awesome plot I will get this DVD and everyone else needs to too!

2012-05-09,"First of all, I never give anything a 10 because that means perfection and giving the movie a 9 also leaves some kind of room for improvement for any potential future Avengers movies. With that in mind, I may even give this a 9.5.After movies such as Spiderman being a disappointment and having the newest Batman series to compare to The Avengers, I wasn't sure what to expect. Also, taking into consideration that the latest Marvel movies such as the X-men Origin movies and individual Avengers (Ironman 1 and 2, Thor, Hulk) seeming to have fairly good ratings, or at least good movies to me, I was almost curious if this was going to be a disappointment after a streak of good movies. At the same time, I usually walk into movies with low expectations so if it is a let down, I'm not as let down as other people are. However, with this movie, I couldn't help but to have a higher expectation seeing previous Marvel movies.So, being really excited for this movie, during and after the movie I was thrilled with it. It blew my mind and I seriously felt like a kid in awe and they did so well taking childhood characters and making it possible to be watched by any age.For the tough critics, if you are not a fan of comic book superheros or just not a fan of any of the Marvel/DC movies, I would recommend this film if I was to try to change your mind. I know some who were let down by Thor and/or Captain America, and a couple people who were slightly disappointed by Iron-Man, then I believe The Avengers movie will fully redeem those disappointments for you.If you also haven't seen any of the individual Avengers movies (Thor, Ironman 1 & 2, Captain America, Hulk), it's not an absolute much to watch, I do believe it sure does help though.

The way they brought all the characters together in the storyline , and had them all be able to connect and shows that each knew of each other already to me was amazing. The film also brought a lot of action and one on one fights. Which I believe everyone who is a fan of these films loved because the question is always asked who the best superhero is. But besides the fighting each other there were a lot of action in New York that just blows your mind, the nonstop adrenaline, anticipating what will happen next just have you on the edge of your seat, biting your finger nails. I believe the actors/actresses did an amazing job on portraying these characters. They really brought them to life and interconnect them. I personally never saw Thor the movie, but he brought it in this movie to where I didn't need to go watch that movie first. Thor and Hoki had a moment where it explains what they are and who they are. I like how they brought that out it really makes the film that much better. And also I like how when they go to recruit it shows a little about every person but not too much these characters were played at their best. Costumes and props where amazing, from iron man's new suits, to captain America actually still wearing his new suite in the current life. And Thors hammer that you believed was real from the sound effects. The Avengers brought there A game with this film. Creating a reflection, flying ship that looks invisible. The new technology they brought to this movie I would have never thought of. One last thing I liked how they showed the avengers departing and going back to their daily lives, but also leaves you to think maybe there will be another movie. Guess we will just have to wait and see for ourselves. But if so it also leaves you wondering just what will the second film be about since that just swept everything I've imagined it to be",10.0,2012-11,Monday,"able:0.05, about:0.06, action:0.07, actors:0.04, actually:0.04, all:0.04, already:0.05, also:0.13, always:0.04, amazing:0.12, america:0.03, an:0.03, and:0.18, another:0.04, are:0.05, at:0.03, avengers:0.08, away:0.05, back:0.04, be:0.11, because:0.03, believe:0.15, best:0.09, better:0.04, big:0.04, brought:0.37, but:0.11, captain:0.03, characters:0.08, did:0.03, didn:0.04, each:0.10, effects:0.03, ever:0.04, every:0.04, everyone:0.04, everything:0.04, expected:0.05, fact:0.05, fan:0.04, fighting:0.05, film:0.12, films:0.03, first:0.03, for:0.06, from:0.08, go:0.07, going:0.04, great:0.03, had:0.09, have:0.07, he:0.03, hero:0.04, heroes:0.03, his:0.03, how:0.13, hulk:0.02, if:0.03, in:0.09, iron:0.03, is:0.06, it:0.16, job:0.04, just:0.13, last:0.04, life:0.09, like:0.05, liked:0.05, little:0.04, looks:0.05, lot:0.08, loved:0.05, made:0.03, makes:0.04, man:0.03, maybe:0.05, me:0.06, mind:0.05, moment:0.05, movie:0.12, movies:0.03, much:0.06, must:0.04, need:0.05, never:0.08, new:0.16, next:0.05, not:0.02, of:0.11, on:0.07, one:0.09, other:0.09, out:0.03, played:0.05, real:0.05, really:0.09, saw:0.05, say:0.04, second:0.05, see:0.03, simple:0.05, since:0.04, so:0.02, still:0.04, storyline:0.05, superhero:0.03, that:0.16, the:0.35, their:0.06, them:0.09, there:0.08, these:0.10, they:0.25, thing:0.04, think:0.03, this:0.07, thor:0.08, thought:0.04, to:0.20, together:0.03, too:0.03, ve:0.04, wait:0.05, was:0.04, watch:0.03, way:0.03, we:0.03, were:0.06, what:0.08, when:0.03, where:0.12, which:0.03, who:0.09, will:0.12, with:0.04, would:0.03, york:0.05, you:0.09, your:0.12"
2012-05-24,"In fact, there is no need to comment on this film and everything done is perfect. It should be congratulated that film's director and writer. The film came up to my expectations totally. Cast of the film consists of my favorite actor and actress whose name are Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson. A negative thing about film, the beginning of the film is a bit boring, because scenes in the film take place in a ship I guess which made me a bit bored. But the scenes which was taking place in city is very fantastic and realistic which made me very excited.After watching it, immediately I examine avengers om IMDb in terms of its budget, gross and vote. I saw that its gross is approaching one million dollars and also its rate is 8.7 and absolutely it deserves that.The another thing which impresses me is unbelievable scenes. They are really really perfect and still have a bearing upon this film. Also the extra-terrestrials who are coming other planet is very realistic.Especially, character of hulk is very funny and attractive. To sum up,but for beginning of the film, rest of the film is very great and thanks director and cast for presenting such a fantastic film.",10.0,2012-05,Thursday,"about:0.05, absolutely:0.09, actor:0.08, after:0.06, also:0.10, and:0.28, another:0.07, are:0.11, avengers:0.03, be:0.04, because:0.05, beginning:0.17, bit:0.14, boring:0.08, but:0.06, came:0.08, cast:0.12, character:0.05, coming:0.08, director:0.13, done:0.07, especially:0.07, everything:0.06, expectations:0.08, fact:0.08, fantastic:0.14, favorite:0.08, film:0.42, for:0.06, funny:0.07, great:0.04, have:0.03, hulk:0.04, imdb:0.09, in:0.13, is:0.26, it:0.08, its:0.16, jeremy:0.07, johansson:0.07, made:0.10, me:0.14, my:0.09, need:0.08, no:0.05, of:0.17, on:0.04, one:0.03, other:0.05, perfect:0.13, place:0.17, really:0.09, renner:0.07, rest:0.08, saw:0.07, scarlett:0.06, scenes:0.16, should:0.06, still:0.06, such:0.07, take:0.07, that:0.09, the:0.23, there:0.04, they:0.04, thing:0.13, this:0.05, to:0.07, up:0.09, very:0.24, was:0.03, watching:0.06, which:0.20, who:0.05"
2012-04-30,"In the last few Marvel movies ( Iron Man 1 and 2, the Incredible Hulk, Captain America and Thor) was an after-credits scene which referred to this coming movie The Avengers. Small scenes which were just enough to wetten the appetite for the planned movie. Well the movie has arrived here in Europe. Story is simple enough. Loki, adopted brother of Thor has his eyes set on conquering the world and subjugating it's people. ( Freedom is overrated according to Loki) In the first scene he manages to steal something from the very secret S.H.I.E.L.D facility. That's when Nick Fury assembles his dream-team. The earnest Captain America, the one and only Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man, Thor himself, Dr Banner ( the Hulk, played by a wonderful, wonderful Mark Ruffalo who's just right for the role) Natasha Romanov and after a short trip to the dark side Hawkeye. Of course there's friction between these strong characters, but in the end they work pretty good together. The Avengers is everything I dreamed of and more. It's big on action, no doubt about it. It looks plain awesome. It's never boring. The chemistry between the actors is obvious and at times the movie is very funny. ( the way the Hulk fights Loki had me almost wetting my pants) It's serious when it needs to be..and when I left the movietheatre I had a big smile on my face. That doesn't happen to me that often. I think this movie is best enjoyed if you've seen at least some of the movies that preceded it most notably Iron Man and Thor.

2012-04-28,"This was one hell of a mind-blowing, fantastic ensemble. I entered the theatre with some trepidation. Don't get me wrong, I love Joss Whedon. His Firefly, Dollhouse really impressed me with their thoughtful insights to complex subjects and excellent stories with witty dialogs. But this being a superhero movie with characters so diverse, I suspected this may just be a mash-up of said characters with some good battles with Whedon's trademark one-liners. Boy was I stumped.This movie never failed to keep my mouth open with shock and sheer awe at what I was watching. Also laughter. This was a movie I will not forget. Or be satisfied with watching only once.Witty dialogs punctuate every minute every one of which are neither clichéd, overdone or badly timed. But humour is only part of its brilliance as story too is pretty good with some amazing, some awesome, some sad and some thoughtful moments. The movie is very well paced, so much so that I barely realised the 140 minutes passing by.The casting was perfect, with all the characters coming over from their respective movies. Except Bruce Banner who was now played by Mark Ruffalo taking over from Ed Norton. In the Hulk movies, Bruce was a scientist struggling with his inner demons threatening to release his darker (greener) alter ego. But here, he needed to be confident, funny, witty, smart (which was seriously downplayed in the 2 Hulks) to have any chance against such powerful characters. Mark Ruffalo carries his character with remarkable panache and delivers a memorable character.The rest of the cast were amazing. Robert Downey Jr as Tony, the self- loving, arrogant and over-smart playboy, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, the regal guardian come to stop his brother in his tracks, Chris Evans as the out-of-place hero who tries to fit in, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow who has a substantial role to play (not just eye-candy though she delivers plenty of that too), Jeremy Renner as the stoic and unshakable Hawk-eye and of course, Samuel Jackson as the enigmatic commander, Nick Fury. Tom Hiddleston, on the villainous side is amazing as the nihilistic, ego-maniacal Loki who is now stylish, confident and devious in contrast to his Thor persona where he is more childish in his harried quest for revenge. Every character is given a major role with no-one sidelined or underused. All these characters from different eras, locations and occupations are blended beautifully though not without conflicts which are highlighted as a major plot point. This was a much better idea than merely bringing them to save Earth and explaining away these differences which any other director would have easily done.This brings me to Joss Whedon. With Spielberg giving us mediocrities like Tintin, Indiana Jones and War of the Worlds, this comes as a respite from old and boring directors who have been ruling big-budget screen-space for far too long. With X-Men: First Class bringing forth Matthew Vaughn, this too will bring Whedon to the limelight and hopefully, spur producers to give this underrated talent more opportunities.This has been my movie of the year(so far) and the best Superhero movie I have EVER seen.

2012-04-27,"I suppose the question on your lips is 'Any Good?'The short answer is 'yes'.The longer answer is 'F**k me silly, that film was awesome!'The even longer answer is:Joss Whedon has created a witty, entertaining superhero that more than capably juggles different characters and threads all together into an unsubtle, but solid film.It helps if you've seen the previous Marvel Studio films in the franchise before seeing this. I had personally seen Iron Man 1 and 2, Captain America and Thor although I had not seen The Incredible Hulk with Edward Norton and I had a good idea of the principal characters and what was going on. There is the barest bones of back-story for each of the heroes but the majority of exposition is around the character of Black Widow (Scarlett Johannson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo).Speaking of which, Mark Ruffalo somehow steals the show as the Hulk, utterly removing the previously uninspiring film adaptations. He is amazing, in every way. Bruce Banner gets some quality lines and Mark Ruffalo delivers in pretty much every way, it is a lot more of a subtle performance than most of his fellow actors, who are much more brazen, brash and forward.Robert Downey Jr once again delivers as Iron Man, a character that is as rich and as interesting two films down the line as he ever was. He gets the best lines and even though it takes a little bit of time to introduce Iron Man compared to some of the other characters, he sticks in the mind and has his own standouts moments alongside the rest of the Avengers.Captain America (Chris Evans) is also on top form as Captain America, a character I was initially concerned would not fit well into the dynamic of the group but his character fits really nicely.As a personal favourite, it is always nice to see Loki on the screen. His 'little brother' syndrome makes his a fascinating villain in Thor and Tom Hiddleston absolutely proves he is brilliant as this twisted, powerful trickster. In Loki, once again, Marvel Studios provide a villain that is as well fleshed out and as interesting as the heroes. I've already mentioned Josh Whedon's outlandish ability to fuse together so many characters into a film well. When all the Avengers have assembled, each character and their traits clash in a....realistic way, the selfless with the arrogant etc etc. Whilst the film does try extremely hard to have as many Avenger on Avengers fights as possible and they are thrilling, seeing them work together as a team is frankly fantastic. Again, several stunning shots pan seamlessly from one character to the next, cutting through the large amounts of chaotic action to deliver what you wanted to see, superheroes beating on things.Another key Whedon-ish (tm) is the humour. It is a pretty funny film too boot.Its $220 million budget went a long way too. Apart from the actors and the not inconsiderable sums of money they would have been paid, the CGI is almost faultless. It is awesome, and always seems to make the events feel like a comic book. Again, the standout being a very realistic, physical Hulk. The best incarnation yet, for sure. It's not without fault:The plot is nonsense.

2012-05-03,"Thanks to names like Michael Bay and most recently, Peter Berg, movies that had all the makings of a motion picture event went from ridiculous to ludicrous in the short time it took a movie patron to feel the phantom pinch of money lost forever; But not if Joss Whedon has anything to say about it. And say he does! In what has to be the best super-hero action movie spectacle in a long, long time, Whedon gives you value and oomph, two sides of a coin if you will, for every buck you have put aside to watch this movie.In epic form, both visually and cinematically, Whedon's screenplay begins where ""Iron Man 2"", ""Thor"" and ""Captain America :The First Avenger"" ends. A common thread running through these movies is Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D and proprietor of a task force, albeit super-human, put together to protect a sustainable energy source called the Tesseract from falling into the wrong hands. But it does and those hands belong to Loki, Thor's conniving adopted brother who arrives unannounced and steals the Tesseract. Following this prologue, Fury assembles the Avengers. From New York to Calcutta, Iron Man, Black Widow, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and The Hulk converge on a mission to prevent Loki from exerting his devious plans. However, before our heroes can say ""lock and load"", they have to first learn a painful lesson about he values of humility and unity.There are innumerable ways that make this movie a cinematic event for 2012. As the screenwriter and director, Whedon's first nuance is in hoisting this movie way above the hype it created ever since trailers piqued global interest last year. Up until now, we knew something big was brewing within the confines of the Marvel universe. Yet as we have seen before, very few film makers have succeeded in simultaneously pleasing Marvel fanboys as well as action movie fans. Again, this is where Whedon cuts a niche for himself in satisfying die-hard comic book fans alongside a generic cinema audience clueless about the two worlds that exist between Marvel and DC. From a cinematic standpoint, Whedon also goes as far as busting the myth that quantity is better than quality. With a plethora of Hollywood A-listers suited up in peculiar costumes (I dare say), the narration ensures that each of their characters add an equal and important input to the story. What I like about this is Whedon's method of giving each superhero 15 minutes of egotistical fame and then letting them pummel each other before receiving another round of motherless beatings from Loki and his unsightly army. During all this, the story is structured as such that none of our heroes actually gain dominance over the others. Yes, viewers will eventually find an individual preference but Whedon has cleverly taken the reliance on a main protagonist out of the equation. Personally though, I enjoyed every moment Bruce Banner turned into ""the other guy"". Then there is the icing on the cake ― Whedon's well written dialogue, void of clichés but rife with wit. Speaking of wit, this has to be the first superhero action movie induced with so much humor, that at times it is possible to miss a joke here and there. As such, Whedon's slight of hand is the perfectly timed moments when you are made to laugh right in the middle of an intense battle scene. Brilliant!Without doubt, character portrayals are just spot on with all actors in top form. As expected, Robert Downey, Jr. brings his usual flamboyance as the billionaire philanthropist Tony Stark, AKA Iron Man. Chris Evans is even better in his second outing as Captain America and is convincing as a 1940s hero grappling with current times. Again, Witty sarcasm between these two characters are well written and well placed. Other standouts are Mark Ruffalo as the timid Bruce Banner with a furious green giant lurking within, Scarlett Johansson as the sensuous and butt-kicking SHIELD agent and Jeremy Renner as the skilled archer, Hawkeye. Watch out for this guy, an up and coming one-man action movie hero rumored to take big names in some long running movie franchises. Centrally positioned as the antagonist, Tom Hiddleston's Loki brings along a malignant delusion to rule earth, whose only non-human deterrent is Chris Hemsworth's fellow Norse god, Thor. As polar opposites, both characters benefit from immersive depth by Hiddleston and Hemsworth, each having upped the notch since their previous team up in ""Thor"".Centrally themed, most superhero movies are about saving the world from annihilation. With that premise done to death, Whedon's forte is in rolling out the plausibility that society's menace cannot be brought down with the will of just one strong individual. Clearly embedded is the message that it takes unity and a lot of heart to put up a worthy defense against any and all forms of evil. Before the end of summer, a lone hero lurking in the dark will try to prove otherwise. For now, it suffices to say that Whedon has raised the bar and in the process gives Marvel a shiny new upgrade.

2012-04-26,"It's clear from the start that Whedon want's to honour the opportunity to show us what superheroes can do. We get to enjoy a classic comparison of ""real people"" in a world of ""super people""... the beats are perfect... I found myself feeling hugely impressed at the skill set and technology of the shield operatives, then completely sorry for them when they are thrust into the world of the Avengers. The Avengers themselves were pitched at a power level far greater than set up in the preceding movies, but they were only the better for it. The speed of the impacts, the level of catastrophic damage that they leave in their wake... all perfect. The only missed opportunity I felt was for Captain America... still too much of the poster boy soldier, and not enough of the Captain, except when he is dealing with shield agents, or policemen... and I still wanted the Captain to move more like Bronski did in the Hulk. Thor is definitely a God in this, and the Hulk is definitely a poorly guided atomic bomb. Iron Man and Banner's intelligence was a blast to watch, and the swagger of Stark is nicely offset by moments of fear for the limitations of his tech. I gripped my seat, with the peril, and I laughed out loudly (along with the entire audience) at the moments... you will know when you do too...

2012-05-10,"I had my reservations about Avenger Assemble for a long time- it is not my sort of film. The only previous films in the saga I saw before this were Iron Man (which I didn't like) and Captain America (which I did). What made Captain America for me was that it was interesting that is was set against the backdrop of world war II, and the redeeming feature of Iron Man was the witty dialogue between Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow. So the task is, how do they make a film with all of these stars, with so much back-story, set in the modern era, without it turning into Iron Man 2.5 (which it does in places), that lives up to the MASSIVE hype? Let's face it, since the film has been building up people's expectations for that long and with so many huge stars competing for screen time and the best dialogue it was never going to be anything but a little bit of a mess. What it is though is an enjoyable mess. They don't go down the route of the Transformers films (Revenge of the Fallen in particular) and just spend 2 hours making 2 dimensional robot characters smash each other up. Avengers Assamble is enjoyable because of the characters involved. It is to its advantage that the back-stories for most of the main characters have been established already, it means that we can just get on with the film and not spend to much time discussing the wherefores and the hows. It is also good that despite having only seen 2 of the previous 5 films I was able to understand perfectly well what was going on the film. The story is very simple and not at all confusing (unlike Transformers ROTF) and requires very little thinking. If you do take anytime to actually think about the film it is clearly just a ""slot A into tab B"" affair- very predictable and formulaic- but if you take it for what it is and enjoy the ride it is very entertaining. It is the characters that make the film. Unlike the Transformers films the characters are all unique and well rounded. They all seem to have their own part to play (apart from Black Widow, who aside from looking good and being the token female seems to have nothing to do and no real superpowers). It does turn a little into Iron Man 2.5 at times, after all it is clear he has the best powers and Robert Downey Jr. is the biggest star so it is hard not too. Some of his lines do get a little less witty and a little more silly at times but it is never really too much of a problem. Each character does have their part to play and it was interesting watching their interplay on screen. The film as a whole was nothing more than a formulaic affair, going from confrontation to confrontation without much to link it together, but this is not really a problem. It relies heavily on special effects, which is OK since they work well in the context of the film. The final huge CGI fest that was the end battle was done very well, with each character getting a similar amount to do (with the exception of Black Widow) and it was consistently interesting (unlike the climaxes of the Transformers films which were just dumb smash 'em up's for an hour). I do take issue with one thing though- a tiny amount of CGI in the climax battle was quite poor (Scarlett Johansson flying on the hover-bike thing)- almost unforgivable in a film that relies to heavily on special effects and which has such a big budget. The actors do a great job, for me Mark Ruffalo stealing the show with his unhinged, unstable Banner, though Tom Hiddleston was great too. It is this that makes the film so watchable. Without such interesting characters the film would just be a big dumb mess. In the end the film is nothing more than formulaic but a very well done formulaic film. The director Whedon clearly knew exactly what he was doing at every scene of the film. I think it is very commendable that with the amount of hype surrounding the film and the number of stars competing in the film that he has formed anything other than a complete mess. When it comes down to it Avengers Assemble is an enjoyable film, made so by the characters and the actors portraying them. It is very funny at times and surprisingly never boring.

2012-04-29,"I'm a big fan of Joss Whedon since Buffy days, love Firefly and Serenity, so when I heard he was directing an Avengers movie I started to have faith that it would be done right. Once again Joss didn't disappoint.Leaving aside the obvious opportunity for ridiculously good action sequences that an Avengers movie can have, and this film has a lot, it was important that whoever directed this captured the different personalities that make up the team, and the way they clash. Joss has always been good at writing for his characters, which is why here he's pretty much perfectly grabbed each hero's personality. The dialogue between them is great and believable and being the fan he has been of The Avengers since the 60s, he has a good idea of their background and what drives and motivates each of them. There's some great exchanges between them as they work out their differences and when we reach the climax and they finally come together and work as a team... what a treat.The actors that have portrayed their characters in past films are now set, you can't see anyone else playing the characters they play. They're all fantastic, work brilliantly as an ensemble and the new addition - Mark Ruffalo as Banner/Hulk is a great choice, bringing that air of a man who's come to terms with his plight and learned to be calm and relaxed, but with the temper just brimming below the surface. This is the best film featuring Hulk to date, and because Hulk this time was based on Ruffalo's movements and not entirely CGI, it's the most realistic Hulk we've received to date as well.I'd also like to mention here that Joss is great at writing humour into his stories and this film isn't short of some truly laugh-out-loud moments. Anyone who's a fan of his work in the past will recognise his brand of humour in this film.To sum up, anyone who's a fan of superhero movies will love this, it has everything you could've hoped for in an Avengers movie. It's great to see some of our beloved comic book heroes given their dues in some great movies lately, such as Nolan's Batman films and X-Men First Class and this film is up there with the best. I'll be looking forward to the sequel, especially after the sequence during the credits.Highly recommended.",10.0,2012-04,Sunday,"action:0.02, actors:0.04, after:0.04, again:0.04, all:0.02, also:0.03, always:0.05, an:0.11, and:0.29, anyone:0.17, are:0.02, as:0.14, at:0.06, avengers:0.09, banner:0.04, batman:0.06, be:0.07, because:0.04, been:0.07, being:0.04, best:0.06, between:0.09, big:0.04, book:0.04, but:0.02, can:0.06, cgi:0.05, characters:0.08, come:0.08, comic:0.04, could:0.04, credits:0.06, dialogue:0.05, didn:0.04, different:0.05, done:0.05, each:0.07, else:0.06, ensemble:0.06, especially:0.05, everything:0.04, fan:0.18, fantastic:0.05, film:0.13, films:0.07, finally:0.05, first:0.03, for:0.06, given:0.05, good:0.08, great:0.17, has:0.14, have:0.07, he:0.12, here:0.09, hero:0.04, heroes:0.04, highly:0.06, his:0.16, hulk:0.10, humour:0.12, idea:0.06, in:0.09, into:0.04, is:0.11, isn:0.05, it:0.09, joss:0.14, just:0.03, like:0.03, ll:0.05, looking:0.06, lot:0.04, love:0.09, make:0.04, man:0.03, mark:0.04, moments:0.05, most:0.04, movie:0.06, movies:0.06, much:0.03, new:0.04, not:0.02, now:0.04, of:0.17, on:0.03, once:0.05, our:0.06, out:0.06, past:0.12, perfectly:0.06, play:0.06, pretty:0.05, re:0.05, right:0.05, ruffalo:0.08, see:0.06, sequel:0.06, sequences:0.05, set:0.05, short:0.06, since:0.10, so:0.03, some:0.12, such:0.05, superhero:0.03, team:0.08, that:0.14, the:0.33, their:0.13, them:0.10, there:0.06, they:0.14, this:0.14, time:0.03, to:0.15, together:0.03, truly:0.06, up:0.09, ve:0.09, was:0.06, way:0.04, we:0.07, well:0.03, what:0.06, whedon:0.03, when:0.06, which:0.03, who:0.10, why:0.04, will:0.06, with:0.06, work:0.18, would:0.03, writing:0.12, you:0.05"

2014-11-15,"I'm really more of a DC guy and watched this movie well out of synch with other related Marvel films and TV series I've watched previously but even as some of the finer points of the narrative went over my head somewhat, nevertheless this epic team-up of four (plus two) major super-heroes was an absolute blast. The two and a half hour viewing time absolutely flew by making this one of the best blockbusters I've seen from the comic universe. The longer playing time allows plenty of room for character development as well as initial face-offs between Iron Man and Captain America and later Hulk and Thor to whet the appetite for the all-action SFX fest finale, when the heroes, plus Black Widow and Hawkeye, finally get their act together to repel the Chitauri alien invasion plotted by Loki. All the main characters get more or less equal on-screen exposure apart possibly from Hulk but his delayed appearance is of course in line with the surprise element his transformation engenders and is very much worth the wait in any case. There's room for humour too, unsurprisingly in the main from cynical Tony Stark / Iron Man and some sight gags too, like the Hulk's slightly overdone fist-pump with Thor and also his later take-down of Loki after a suitably grandiose speech by the latter. As the most successful individual performer in the franchise, it's not a huge shock to see Iron Man save the day this time but fans of the individual heroes will all be satisfied with how their favourites are treated I'm sure. Besides the heroes, Tom Hiddlestone makes for a convincingly asinine Loki, Samuel J Jackson gets to jut and chomp a lot as Nick Fury and the likable Clark Greig impresses as Fury's straight-arrow right-hand man Coulson. The effects are literally out-of-this-world as New York is laid-waste by the invading Chitauri and their massive caterpillar-type spaceship and individual ""Silver Surfer""-type jet-ski flying machines. Sure you have to suspend a lot of disbelief as the super six take on and defeat an army of it would appear thousands but it is the comics after all.It seems to me Marvel is well ahead of DC in the movie stakes certainly if this all-action mega-hit is anything to go by.

2012-04-28,"Marvel's Avengers...A well paced movie that delivers from the beginning. It's hard to review this awesome movie without give some spoilers, but I'll try to do my best, promise.I tried to keep my expectations low about this movie before it came out, because watching this all- star cast playing the ""superheroes"" is exciting itself. you have to add Samuel L Jackson as ""Nick Fury"" and a very good CGI work pumped up by a big amount of money. But I have seen a lot of movies with great casts and high budgets going down (cough *batman and robin* cough), so I decided to stay calm and not to get hyped.So the movie started with a very decent action scene that sets up the whole plot fast and effectively. Even when I tried to forget what this was about, I couldn't help myself and I was sold after the ten first minutes. Why? Because you can't help it!! you get to go in deep with every main character's motivations. The action never stops growing and the tension last until the very last minute. It's impossible not to fall in love with movies like this! Every relationship between the superheroes are well established and when the moment comes, it shows.What are they avenging?: Spoiler! It's Hulk well done in this movie? Hell Yeah!! (finally) It's Tony Stark above the rest of Avengers?: Nope, he's part of an awesome team!Is this movie worth to see on cinemas? oh, please, oh, please, don't miss it.

2012-05-21,This is what action adventure is all about yes it is clustered but thats hardly something to criticize. This has to be one of the best comic book based movie i have Ever seen the main villain is no Heath Ledger-Joker but Loki does work as the main Antagonist I think maybe there Should have been other well known Marvl villains in the movie. All the Characters work well Robert Doweny Jr and Samuel L Jackson were At there best. A first the team can't get along this is just what Loki wants he lets himself get captured to sabotage the group anyone who knows anything about Loki knows no mortal prison can hold him. Thor start off a odds with the rest of the Avengers because he wants Loki to face justice in Asgard Loki wants to start a war against Earth using a power cube. The battle at the end was amazing there are so many action scenes this is what superhero action movies are all about its not dark and edgy it's a fun ride.

2012-05-07,"It has been a long time that I had to wait in line to buy a ticket and then wait in line again to get a good seat. The Avengers was well worth the wait. Director Joss Whedon definitely got it right with this film. Although the film was nearly two and a half hours long it did not feel like it because the momentum of the story flowed so well. As you can tell by the trailer, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has returned to take over the earth and is met by a cast of superheroes assembled by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). All of the main characters were true to form. Iron Man / Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) was exactly like you would expect him to be; arrogant, smart and playful. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) follows his so called brother Loki to earth and the tension between them has not changed from the last time that these two hit the big screen. The Hulk / Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) somehow manages to somewhat tame his beast and join the party. Captain America / Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) has the daunting task of trying to catch up with time while forming a relationship with his new found comrades. I found him to be the most endearing of the heroes because he had so much catching up to do since he was thawed out. The two heroes that did not have their own introduction prior to this film were Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye / Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), although I think that a prequel could possibly work because I think that there is definitely some history there. I have to say that I was not expecting this film to have the level of comedy that it did. I think that the whole audience was caught a little off guard (myself included). Everything about this film was excellent; the acting, the special effects, the character development, the script I could go on and on. I am almost certain that this is not the last time that we see The Avengers. I smell the beginning of many more sequels in the future and I will once again stand in that long line to go and see them. This is not the time to be frugal. Dig in your pockets and go and see this film at the IMAX in 3D.

2012-05-08,"What a great action packed movie of Marvel's finest. It took me some time to finally get a chance to watch it and it is just phenomenal. What can I say about this movie. The acting was good, the story was OK, the special effects were nonetheless impressive and the Heroes' costumes were great. I agree with a friend of mine on this and that is The Avengers is Marvel's own Expendables. The All- Star team that everyone roots for. I also liked the ever comedic lines of Tony Stark as portrayed by Robert Downey Jr., he is quite the character. There were some other comedic spots of the movie that kind of fit and I just couldn't stop laughing even the audience was laughing with me. However there were some disappointments for me. Number One, Hulk wasn't played by Ed Norton, instead we got Mark Ruffalo. In my opinion, he just felt out of place. I mean, Evans, Downey, and Hemsworth are top-notch A-Listers and then you got Ruffalo who just doesn't fit in with them and Number Two, I was expecting Red Skull over Loki. (That's just me.) Loki was a good formidable villain for the Avengers but I think Red Skull would have made the movie even more kick ass.

2012-05-06,"Guaranteed to be one of the biggest films of the year, is ""The Avengers"" going to be one of the best? Well, no, probably not. But with the biggest opening weekend in North American history, I am sure no one cares.After years of Marvel entries, introducing us to the upgraded versions of the likes of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and (in an unfortunate turn) the Hulk, it was all culminating to this: The Avengers...where all these guys come together, along with Nick Fury, Black Widow and Hawkeye (who?).With such a long wait, was the anticipation worth it? Well, sure...I think so! Not being a huge comic geek, I thought the film was thoroughly entertaining. It was fast-paced, action-packed and the writing was good, punchy and terribly funny. To be honest, there could not have been a better choice of film to officially kick-off the 2012 mindless blockbuster season! But is the film itself perfect? No. Far from it. There are lulls in the action that could have been slightly edited. There are jumps in the story that may not be noticed by a fan of the comics that are in the know but leave non-fans scratching their heads a little. And most importantly, there are scenes where the special effects are (ack!) off, and the use of CGI is really noticeable. Really noticeable In a film like ""The Avengers,"" and their $220 million budget, the effects should be absolutely flawless, and the end result here is far from the truth.And the Hulk being 100% CGI is only part of the problem.With a film of this calibre, the one thing that should be absolutely perfect is the special effects.So yes, Robert Downey Jr. does as good a job as ever, Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans are just as expected (although we were robbed of at least one shirtless scene each), Jackson is slightly less intimidating than Fury actually should be, Scarlett Johansson is pretty, Jeremy Renner was alright as whoever Hawkeye is while Mark Ruffalo was surprisingly great as Dr. Banner. Really noteworthy? HIMYM's Cobie Smulders and the return of Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson.And yes, Joss Whedon was certainly the man to helm this film, and there is no doubt that I will be first in line for the two eventual sequels.But no, the film is not perfect. If I had a word of advice for the next instalment: the CGI should be flawless and if you're going to release it in 3D, make the 3D pop, or don't bother doing it at all.But, again, yes, overall, ""The Avengers"" kick starts the summer in grand style. But there is no doubt that I am still looking more forward to ""Prometheus"" and ""Dark Knight Rises,"" both of which, I have a feeling, will be much higher quality films.

2012-08-25,"Having seen all of the other Marvel films that lead to this film and being a huge Marvel Fan I was very excited to see this movie. I feel that this movie is very good and totally worth the wait.Loki comes to Earth and uses the Tesserect and his magical powers to try to take over mankind. Shield decides to put into action the Avengers plan and recruits Bruce Banner, Iron man, and Captain America to join Black Widow on a team of the best on the Earth. Thor also joins with the team later as the planet is still under his protection.This film has great flow to it. It starts off with Loki coming to Earth and then goes into each member of the Avengers joining the team. It really started strongly and I totally forgot about Thor and then he joins the team too. So a lot going on that I liked early which is important to a film like this.All of the members of the Avengers are very good. Robert Downey Jr is great once again as Stark/Iron man. Chris Evans does a good job as Captain America (but I think he was missing something tho). Hemsworth is amazing as Thor again. I like Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye but I feel that something was missing from that character as well, maybe its cause Im a pretty big Hawkeye fan. I thought Mark Ruffalo was OK, but I really liked the Hulk. And Scarlett Johansen is good and her behind is AMAZING! As far as Acton goes, this may be one of the best films I have ever seen in that regard. Tons of great action scenes in this film that I cant do justice trying to speak about. You'll just have to take my word for it.The only real complaints I have are that Loki and his army he uses to attack Earth aren't well explained. I think Loki is good, but he just doesn't come across as a formidable villain in this film or one that people even fear. I cant really say too much more about this without giving a lot away.Great movie. Great action and characters.

2012-05-03,"OK, so I've been sat here for ages trying to write a review of the avengers that actually does the movie justice. Its so hard to say how amazing/brilliant/out of this world the movie actually was, as no words I can think of express how I thought about this film. There was not 1 point in the movie that I drifted off into la-la land my thoughts were more like 'i don't want this film to end'. I was a little uncertain of how all these mega movie stars were all going to fit into 1 movie, well a massive well done to Joss Whedon, if you don't get goosebumps every time one superhero meets another then you clearly have something wrong with you. Like I'm not even joking, go to the doctors or something. The effort that was put into that to make sure it was pulled off was, well, phenomenal. This was my biggest concern about the movie and I for one was not left disappointed. The back story of all the characters were impeccably placed, Whedon took the time needed to re-introduce you to each character which I guess for people who live under rocks it's perfect for, however I wasn't bored watching this, it needed to be in the movie to remind you of each hero's struggle and why they are the way they are. It made you fight with yourself to try and think who you loved the most (Thor).For me this is the best movie I have seen in a long time and is the best marvel movie I have seen (yes I'm saying it, agree or not), it has heaps of action, it has so much humor it will leave you belly laughing for ages, enough to miss what other characters are saying. No characters are overshadowed, the fight scenes are superb and Captain America still has all his charm and cheese. For me The Hulk stole the show, I was at comic con when the announcements for the avengers were made, Mark Ruffalo got so much stick and still has until this day, well to all you people that thought he couldn't pull it off and thought he was going to 'ruin' the movie, eat your own words, you will come out of this film knowing that him being in it has made it something extra special.",10.0,2012-05,Thursday,"about:0.07, action:0.03, actually:0.10, all:0.11, amazing:0.04, america:0.03, and:0.13, another:0.05, are:0.13, as:0.02, at:0.03, avengers:0.05, back:0.05, be:0.03, been:0.04, being:0.04, best:0.06, biggest:0.06, brilliant:0.06, can:0.03, captain:0.03, character:0.03, characters:0.08, come:0.04, comic:0.04, couldn:0.06, day:0.06, disappointed:0.06, does:0.04, don:0.07, done:0.05, each:0.08, end:0.04, enough:0.05, even:0.03, every:0.04, fight:0.09, film:0.08, for:0.17, get:0.04, go:0.04, going:0.09, got:0.05, hard:0.05, has:0.15, have:0.07, he:0.06, here:0.04, hero:0.04, him:0.04, his:0.03, how:0.11, however:0.05, hulk:0.03, humor:0.05, if:0.03, in:0.08, into:0.11, is:0.04, it:0.20, its:0.04, joss:0.04, left:0.06, like:0.06, little:0.05, long:0.05, loved:0.06, made:0.11, make:0.04, mark:0.04, marvel:0.03, me:0.07, more:0.03, most:0.04, movie:0.20, much:0.07, my:0.06, no:0.07, not:0.10, of:0.14, off:0.13, one:0.05, or:0.06, other:0.03, out:0.06, own:0.05, people:0.08, perfect:0.05, point:0.05, put:0.05, re:0.05, review:0.06, ruffalo:0.04, say:0.04, scenes:0.04, seen:0.08, show:0.05, so:0.11, something:0.14, special:0.04, stars:0.06, still:0.08, story:0.03, superhero:0.03, sure:0.05, that:0.12, the:0.34, then:0.04, there:0.03, these:0.04, they:0.06, think:0.08, this:0.15, thor:0.03, thought:0.15, time:0.09, to:0.26, until:0.06, ve:0.04, want:0.05, was:0.22, wasn:0.06, watching:0.05, way:0.04, well:0.12, were:0.13, what:0.03, whedon:0.07, when:0.03, which:0.04, who:0.07, why:0.05, will:0.06, with:0.04, world:0.04, wrong:0.06, yes:0.06, you:0.25, your:0.04"

Teamwork was of the utmost importance, and although most of the characters had their own comic series, it dove into some meaningful character studies by itself.As for the movie, you couldn't really ask for much more. It's got everything that an action/fantasy lover would want and then some. Assembling a team, saving the world against evil while trying to cope with each other is just a lot of fun to watch! Each hero had some interesting story to them. You've got the bulk, brawn, & cooped up anger of the Hulk, the out of time sturdy super soldier Captain America, The playboy genius/joker Iron-Man, the arrogant but powerful & other-worldly Thor & the Russian Shield Agent Black Widow. But not much on Hawkeye. Hawkeye would get his story in later movies.Tom Hiddleston is better than he should be as bad-guy Loki.Director Joss Whedon was good for this, he's a comic book lover, & well established in epic like storytelling for TV shows.

2024-02-12,"8.5/101. Overall Plot - 10/10
The plot of this movie is revolutionary. It is the first time a bunch of movies have been combined into one like this. I love how this is mostly a story of the Avengers being created. Loki being the villain is super cool because it creates a good ""avengers level threat"". I like how they come together in one purpose and get the purpose of having something to avenge.2. Entertainment / Engagement - 10/10
This movie is very entertaining. It is full of lots of cool action scenes. And the slower parts with just dialog a are very good still. Having all of these lovable characters from other movies together, interacting with each other is very fun to watch.Watching all of the Avengers interact and talk together is very engaging. You feel more into the conversation.3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 9/10
This movie has tons of emotion. With the relationships that all of the Avengers have with each other. Loki as the villain is deep too because of how we saw him in Thor.You get pretty invested in it, and want to see them work and interact with each other.4. Theme and Depth of Story - 9/10
This movie could have lots of cool themes. I love the theme of unity. Because before Loki attacks the city, he attacks the Avengers all individually. He does this so they aren't united, and can't work as a team. And it's only once they figure out how to work as a team again that they are able to fight the bad guys.5. Characters - 9/10
All of the characters are great in this. I do wish we saw more Hawkeye being himself more. I think Loki is a great choice to be the first villain for the Avengers. I love Agent Coulson and Nick Fury. They are great Shield characters and help with the creation of the Avengers.Hulk is not great in this. He isn't bad by itself, but compared to the previous Hulk we saw in Incredible Hulk it's terrible. He looks not as cool, and even sounds stupid.6. Acting / Writing - 9/10
All of the actors do great in this. Except maybe Mark Ruffalo. I just don't like him as Bruce Banner. He sucks so much compared to Edward Norton.The writing in this is spectacular. The allusion and foreshadowing to future events is awesome. The set up of how the Avengers get together as a team is very cool as well.7. Cinematography - 8/10
This movies cinematography is pretty good. I love how the main battle is in the middle of the day. It makes it bright, and you can see everything super clearly. I just like the way this movie was filmed. Some of the action shots are very cool.8. Score - 10/10
The Avengers music is so good. It is on the level of John Williams music. The MCU has a lot of good music, and the Avengers theme is one of the best.9. Editing / Pace - 8/10
The pacing is pretty good. I like how a majority of the film is setting up and establishing the Avengers as a team. I really like how this movie is just an introduction, because it sets up things like Avengers 2, where it's a true Avengers movie.10. VFX/Practical Effects - 7/10
I used to think the CGI in this movie was bad. But after watching it again, it's not as bad as I remember. It's still better than some recent MCU movies, which is just sad. That being said, it's still not the best CGI. It's a bit worse than the previous MCU films, but not terrible. Some scenes are really noticeably CGI, but some are still pretty good.Average Score:
8.9/10My Overall Rating and Final Thoughts:
8.5/10

There are some very funny moments in the film (most of which comes from Robert Downey Jr) Whenever there is action you can clearly tell whats happening and you can really enjoy it. Then when the final battle happens and ends it made me just feel good. You see six heroes just work together and it just pleases you. The two after credits scenes are also enjoyable.

2012-09-26,"SPOILERS AHEAD Let me preface it by saying I have never been a fan of the Marvel comics and only found a couple of the set-up movies to be decent. However, I was still intrigued because of the very good reviews from critics and the box office success. After watching, this is not what I would consider a good film. It's basically on par or slightly above Michael Bay's Transformers series, and anyone who has read my reviews of those knows how low I think of them (even the best, the original, is really only average). Avengers is pretty well made, decently well acted, and slickly produced. But it just doesn't have a good story and the premise is basically absurd. First, the villain is nothing special. Loki's motives are vague, his plan confusing at best, and at no point is his character even that menacing. Right from the start you know that Thor or Iron Man or Hulk could kick the crap out of him so there's never any suspense as to whether Loki would succeed. Second, all the science and techno talk throughout makes little sense and is very difficult to follow. I found myself not caring about Iron Man and Bruce Banner's supposed genius after a while. The script is just soooo formulaic. You know the heroes will have personality clash at first, you know there will be a sombering event that will pull them all together, and you know they will prevail. This has been done a million times in these movies and to be honest, it's been done way better.What is even the point of the Scarlet Johansen and Jeremy Renner characters? They're human and their abilities are really impossible to even believe, same with their effectiveness when fighting the final battle. In reality, they'd have been killed in like 2 seconds like any other human fighting in a battle of immortals. Renner's acting was also pretty bad. Same with Chris Evans, Captain America was just a wooden character. And for a movie that was praised for a clever script and lot of humor, I laughed only a handful of times, even Robert Downey Jr's alleged wit got annoying.And like I said, no suspense in the final battle. The alien army that had been built up throughout turns out to be very easily defeatable. These guys get killed like nothing and don't even appear to have any special powers. Their forces turn out to be quite light as well. Besides, Hulk and Thor are basically portrayed as immortal, same as Iron Man when he is in the suit (which has every magical ability under the sun), so there is zero suspense because no one watching could ever believe for a second that any of these 3 could actually be defeated or killed. The way Iron Man blows up their big ship is a ripoff of Independence Day anyway and of course he lives, once again, zero suspense as to whether he would make it. It's just poor film-making. And really, Micahel Bay could have made this movie especially the final battle, that's basically what it is.Overall, you'd have to be a huge fanboy of the comics to think this is a great movie. It's really not. Plus, at 2 hours and 20 minutes, it drags and drags and is a tough watch.

All of the characters are well-developed and share equal importance to the action-packed story. It's this key focus on character that really sets the film apart. The story itself is pretty generic, but it's the way in which the characters interact throughout the film that give it a personality. All of the cast are great, the score by Alan Silvestri is epic, and the script is full of witty dialogue that elevates the entertaining action sequences.

The movie did an amazing job at uniting these characters and the team. Especially since the individual films all had their own style and feel. I love how they keep everyone one to their truest form. The story flows perfectly and feels right. The cast is like a well fit puzzle, they all glow, no one gets shoved aside and no one stands out more than the other, they're all great. The comedy was top-notch, I loved the mixture of action, heart and funny scenes, the movie was perfectly balanced. And above all they finally did the hulk justice. Mark Ruffalo is the hulk. He's perfect for it. They wrote his script so cleverly and the hulk himself is just down right cool. For the first time we really get to see SHIELD in its full glory.

2013-11-03,"When i sat down to watch the Avengers i had little if not any hope that i would enjoy it. But i was wrong, what happened when the film started was a collection of events that changed my ""little hope"" attitude into something much different. After the opening scene i was, to say the least, entertained. But, when i tasked myself with the painfully easy job of rating this film, all this film is...is entertainment. In a time of dazzling CGI and insanely fun action sequences, The Avengers lives up to the hype. But in a world of intriguing plot, immersing performances and emotional roller coaster rides, The Avengers is nothing but another Transformers movie. Let me elaborate. Fans of the Marvel Comics will love this movie, because it does what it says on the tin, it effectively brings the heroes (not all of them, but some) together in a fist fight with a destructive foe. To a Marvel fan, this is gold. To a ""film"" fan, however, this movie is little more than a popcorn flick. People enjoying this movie is not my issue, i want people to enjoy movies, but when it comes to the rating systems on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes (etc) people have, wrongly, rated the Avengers near to the highest of all ratings. Films like the Godfather, ALIEN, Shane, Vertigo, Psycho, Blade Runner, Goodfellas, Jaws and many, many more films deserve the high rating because these are cinematic masterpieces. These are films which changed cinema, and have set the benchmark for all genres of today's films. But when i see The Avengers at the top of the ratings with them, it disgusts me. It should be rated fairly, on an accurate basis of how the film is crafted and the impact it makes, and for me it is a 4. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad movie. But, it is not a classic, nor by far a masterpiece, which renders most fans reviews redundant. People can love this movie, hell it can be there favorite movie of them all, but they need to understand it is nowhere near the Giants of cinema. Its not worth all the hype, but its fun.

2018-05-07,No spoilers here - all the characters were introduced so seamlessly.

That had some hilarious results. I love the Dr Strange/Tony Stark moments but you kinda knew they had to come. Bruce fighting with Hulk was hilarious. Thanos is a great character and a way that unifies what all the teams are doing. One of the highlights of the film has to be when peter dinklage shows up in ....well in the form he showed up in! (you'll see!) it was delightful to see him and i heard at least 10 audible sighs of glee at seeing him. Groot and Rocket hangin around with Thor was Hilarious.

2012-05-05,"Okay first of all I am not your snooty critic who likes silent movies, artsy stuff. I love the action movies, super hero comics. I loved captain America movie, iron man was good too. However this movie was mindless crap. There were no plot variations, dialog's were comical at best. It was just pointless CGI effects. The villain had absolutely no depth and frankly was brainless. At least change the script a bit, put in some variations in the script and hire actors who have depth in acting. Captain America at least had a decent story line, you could connect with the character, the same with iron man and the same with the spider man series. This one from the start was just mindless violence, aliens blowing up crap. All super hero movies should have a good story line, a villain who can many shades to their character. That's why Dark Knight was so good not only because the script had some meaning(terrorism, seeing the good versus bad in people) and of course Heath ledger amazing rendition of the Joker. I realize this isn't a movie that will win an Oscar and also it's meant to park your brain at home and just enjoy but at least put in some effort instead of just letting computer animation take over.

2020-09-27,"The first Marvel team up movie and the last film in Phase One of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with almost every hero in this movie having their own film before this introducing them for the first time, leading to a big event with them all coming together to defeat a big threat from a returning well established villain; after rewatching the movie, I can still say that the first Avengers movie is still a fantastic Marvel film all these years later. The team up movie The Avengers (2012) has outstanding performances, fun action, likable characters, a great Marvel villain, well-done CGI and visual effects, and funny Marvel humor; I am sure there are points in the plot or certain moments in the movie that you will notice as issues, and I did notice them too while watching the film, but they did not bother me because I was too invested in what was happening.Actors Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, and Robert Downey Jr. Are once again great as the Marvel heroes Steve Rogers/Captain America, Tony Stark/Iron Man, and Thor, with them being at odds with each other at first on how to handle the Loki situation but later knowing how to work together; with a connection to Captain America on what he knows about the Tesseract, and Thor trying to find his brother and knock sense into him. The rest of the team includes Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, Bruce Banner/The Hulk, and Clint Barton/Hawkeye played very well by Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, and Jeremy Renner; Natasha helping Nick Fury put the team together, Bruce helping find the tesseract's location, and though Clint is mind controlled for most of the movie, he snaps out of it and is cool when he joins the team. Lastly, once the team comes together, they have quite a few good interactions with one another, and they work well together when in battle; also, Samuel L. Jackson is great as Nick Fury by forming the team and be the base of operations when on the Helicarrier being the director of the S. H. I. E. L. D. organization.The returning villain Loki, once again played fantastically by Tom Hiddleston, with him making the character a developed villain that you can both love and hate at the same time, because of all the things he does in the movie that harms people, messes with The Avengers team, or helps in his plan to rule over New York with the help of the Chitauri army; there was also an occasional interaction between him and Thor where they talk about previous events from Thor (2011). The action sequences are fun and there are well-done CGI and visual effects used for Iron Man's suits, Thor's thunder/lightning abilities when using his hammer Mjolnir, the flying Helicarrier, and when the Chitauri is attacking the city; the movie has effective and funny humor, with the interactions between themselves and between them and Loki were funny at times and cool to see.The team up movie The Avengers (2012) has well-done performances, fun action, likable characters, a great Marvel villain, well-done CGI and visual effects, and funny Marvel humor; I am sure there are points in the plot or certain moments in the movie that you will think are issues, and they are noticeable when watching the film, but they did not bother me because I did had fun with it. I will just say that this is a good conclusion for Phase One of the MCU, and Phase One is a great start for this ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe; this is worth watching and rewatching for regular fans or lifelong fans of Marvel, which is why this movie is highly recommended, with it showing the fun and enjoyable early days of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",8.0,2020-09,Sunday,"2012:0.07, about:0.04, action:0.05, actors:0.03, after:0.02, again:0.05, all:0.04, almost:0.03, also:0.04, am:0.06, america:0.04, an:0.02, and:0.29, another:0.03, are:0.11, army:0.03, as:0.04, at:0.07, avengers:0.06, banner:0.03, battle:0.03, be:0.02, because:0.07, before:0.03, being:0.05, between:0.08, big:0.05, black:0.02, both:0.03, brother:0.03, bruce:0.06, but:0.04, by:0.06, can:0.04, captain:0.04, cgi:0.09, character:0.02, characters:0.03, chris:0.05, cinematic:0.11, comes:0.03, coming:0.04, cool:0.07, did:0.09, director:0.03, does:0.02, done:0.11, downey:0.02, each:0.02, effects:0.07, evans:0.03, ever:0.02, every:0.02, fans:0.06, fantastic:0.03, few:0.03, film:0.08, find:0.07, first:0.08, for:0.08, from:0.03, fun:0.13, funny:0.11, fury:0.05, good:0.03, great:0.09, had:0.02, has:0.05, have:0.01, having:0.03, hawkeye:0.02, he:0.08, help:0.04, hemsworth:0.03, hero:0.03, heroes:0.02, hiddleston:0.03, highly:0.04, him:0.08, his:0.06, how:0.05, hulk:0.02, humor:0.09, in:0.12, into:0.02, iron:0.04, is:0.11, it:0.03, jackson:0.03, jeremy:0.03, johansson:0.03, jr:0.02, just:0.02, last:0.03, loki:0.06, love:0.03, making:0.03, man:0.03, mark:0.02, marvel:0.20, mcu:0.04, me:0.04, mind:0.03, moments:0.06, most:0.02, movie:0.14, new:0.03, nick:0.05, not:0.03, of:0.11, on:0.05, once:0.10, one:0.06, or:0.08, other:0.02, out:0.02, over:0.02, own:0.03, people:0.03, performances:0.07, played:0.07, plot:0.05, previous:0.03, put:0.03, quite:0.03, renner:0.03, rest:0.03, robert:0.02, ruffalo:0.02, same:0.03, samuel:0.03, say:0.05, scarlett:0.03, see:0.02, sense:0.03, sequences:0.03, stark:0.03, start:0.03, still:0.05, sure:0.06, team:0.22, tesseract:0.07, that:0.07, the:0.48, their:0.02, them:0.10, there:0.07, these:0.02, they:0.10, things:0.03, think:0.02, this:0.07, thor:0.09, though:0.03, time:0.04, times:0.03, to:0.08, together:0.10, tom:0.03, tony:0.03, too:0.05, universe:0.10, up:0.06, used:0.04, very:0.02, villain:0.14, visual:0.10, was:0.04, watching:0.08, well:0.13, were:0.02, what:0.04, when:0.12, where:0.03, which:0.02, while:0.03, why:0.03, widow:0.02, will:0.06, with:0.16, work:0.06, worth:0.03, years:0.03, york:0.04, you:0.05"

2019-10-31,"I heard somewhere this was the first great Marvel flick, or this was the one to watch first, or something like that. Overall, it was entertaining but nothing special. The characters and story are pretty cliched. Some powerful object (a tesseract) falls into the hands of a malicious superhero (Loki, well played by Tom Hiddleston) and a crew comes together to try to get it back from him before he can pass it to the evil aliens who want to destroy Earth. They try to liven things up by creating some character and conflicts and the like, but for the most part it is a snooze. Downey's Iron Man is ironic and witty, Thor turns out to be the estranged brother of Loki, yeah yeah. These kinds of flicks are plug and play, get some star actors and plug them in, and so long as they look the part, things work out. It is fun to watch them flying around midtown Manhattan and smashing things up. The effects are the real stars.It is interesting to note that like our ancestors from previous centuries, the modern world wants to have its myths and its heroes - I guess old habits tend to stick around.

I don't know, maybe I should give up on superhero movies, or maybe Marvel could put a little effort into giving them some meaning. Two and a half hours of stunning effects and breathtaking action, great acting and directing, interesting characters, a few witty remarks, but all together is kind of vain and pointless. The plot didn't engage me, I didn't relate to the characters and I couldn't care less what will happen to them. There was no depth or point. This is simply a couple of hours of superficial fun for those who have fun shutting their brains out. I love the effects and the action and the adrenaline too, but that's not enough for me. I need the film to have a strong story and depth. If I can't have both, I'll always pick a poorly filmed good story rather than superbly made nonsense.

2024-01-27,"This first film about the Avengers gives hope for the next films of the saga. A compelling first chapter, with gorgeous characters, Tony Stark is my favorite, but Thor, Steve Rogers, Bruce and the others are also great. Loki is a charismatic antagonist, who wants revenge against his brother and his family, a nice villain. Superhero costumes are fabulous and also especially the CGI and special effects. The direction of the fights is excellent, the setting of New York is wonderful, there is also a lot of humor, which makes us understand the difference between the MCU and DC, that is that Marvel focuses not only on action like DC, but also on relationships and laughter. A positive note is that it is so noticeable that relations between the Avengers are mostly cold, also noting many conflicts between the characters. Another thing that I think made the movie better than it could have been is Marvel's organization to create first introduction films for the main characters, and then group them all into one spectacular movie. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, Samuel L. Jackson and Tom Hiddleston were fantastic, it wasn't right for what they did to name just a few. A first chapter of exciting saga, we hope it will remain so forever, or even improve..

2024-01-30,"The movie is considered a successful collection of numerous superheroes. The success of Avengers lies in not only bringing together multiple independent characters, but also uniting them into a cohesive team. Each character in the movie has their own unique personality and background, and their cooperation and confrontation constitute the exciting part of the entire story. TwelveThe visual effects of the movie are also appreciated, especially in the IMAX 3D version, where many scenes appear particularly spectacular and vivid.

2024-01-22,"After 4 years and 5 films, the heroes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe finally converged as Phase One closed out with the much-anticipated release of Marvel's The Avengers. Starting with Iron Man (2008) and steadily releasing enjoyable and relatable films, fans were eager to enjoy the first major crossover. Fresh from a successful television career, and before his controversies, director Joss Whedon was brought in to write and direct this historic team-up.Seeking revenge after the events of Thor (2011), Loki (Tom Hiddleston) steals the Tesseract from S. H. I. E. L. D. & Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Set on acquiring a throne of his own, Loki partners with a mysterious benefactor to acquire a Chitauri alien army. With no other option, Fury assembles Earth's mightiest heroes to defend their country. Working together for the first time, personalities clash and egos may get in the way before these seven superheroes can save anyone.Opening by showcasing Loki's dastardly plan, Hiddleston's performance cements itself as one of the best in the saga. While Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) spends most of the film mind-controlled & underutilized, his action sequences are quite fun, and the banter between himself and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) proves to be an enjoyable introduction to their relationship. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is better handled than he was in The Incredible Hulk (2008), giving more of a balance to his characters monstrous rage and yearning for loneliness. While excelling at exploring both sides. The trio of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) are the icing on the already loaded cake, as their performances bring the film to a much higher level. Marvel Studios could not have been luckier when casting the original Avengers and it is shown in every moment of this film.Though an ensemble film of this caliber could easily have felt bloated and messy, The Avengers thrives by utilizing its previously established heroes and expanding upon their universe. Each member adds unique attributes and characteristics, which create thrilling interactions that keep the audience clamoring for more. Having an obsession with comic books and superheroes my entire life, this film was a dream come true.

Loki wants to use the Tesseract to enslave and rule over the human race. Director of SHIELD, Nick Fury, assembles a team to stop him. The team consists of Iron man, Black Widow, Captain America, Thor, hulk, and Hawkeye. The one problem I have with this movie is the way they underutilized Jeremy Renners character Hawkeye.

Most of the characters are full of themselves and unbearable to watch in all their unpleasantness, others are just useless ragdolls, I've never felt even the slightest sign of danger or distress, and the funny parts weren't that funny.

2017-07-28,"It has all come to this. Can a movie starring several grandiose superheroes be good, not only to comic book fans but to the entire world? And they got one of the greatest filmmakers for nerds ever: Joss Whedon. It is very clear in this movie that it is Whedonesque, especially in it's dialogue and jokes.It all comes down to how the team gets together, and the chemistry among the team is immaculate. Everybody on the team work well together no matter what pairing it is: Hulk and Iron Man, Black Widow and Cap, Thor and Hulk, Cap and Iron Man. Notice that one name is missing here and that is Hawkeye. He was basically a zombie follower of Loki for half the film. Hawkeye in the final act is better but even Jeremy Renner knew that he wanted a better storyline. Still though, the entire team of Avengers had incredible chemistry.The villain, Loki, was a great choice for the Avengers to take on. He is a formidable villain, as a trickster god with an alien army. Sure, aliens were a bunch of alien clones but they did prove to be a good matchup against the Avengers.Let's talk about the final battle. It takes place in New York, which is great because that is one of the benefits Marvel has over DC, they take place it cities that we actually live in. Sure, it is fictional but they still went by several places that people have actually been to. It was amazing to see the team fight, either in tandem or by themselves, for 20ish action packed minutes. That doesn't mean I don't have complaints about the film. As I mentioned before, it bothered me how Hawkeye was used, although he did get a chance in the end to make his mark. Cap's costume looked for like a onesie and not something you would expect a war hero and super soldier to wear. The army might have been CGI at the end so it was just mindless action and one-liners, but when it is done this well, you can't really complain.This is a pioneering and spectacular film in it's right. It took something that nobody thought could work, a blockbuster film starring at least 4 larger than life characters that have only had their own movie and made a great movie.+ Cast chemistry + Whedon writing and directing + Loki + Third Act Battle - Really small things (use of Hawkeye for some of the movie, Cap's suit, CGI army)Final Score: 9.5/10",9.0,2017-07,Friday,"10:0.04, about:0.06, action:0.05, actually:0.10, against:0.05, alien:0.11, all:0.04, although:0.05, amazing:0.04, an:0.03, and:0.23, army:0.16, as:0.05, at:0.06, avengers:0.07, battle:0.09, be:0.05, because:0.04, been:0.07, before:0.04, better:0.08, black:0.04, blockbuster:0.05, book:0.04, but:0.10, by:0.06, can:0.06, cast:0.04, cgi:0.09, characters:0.03, come:0.04, comes:0.05, comic:0.04, could:0.04, dialogue:0.05, did:0.07, doesn:0.05, don:0.04, done:0.05, down:0.05, end:0.08, entire:0.12, especially:0.05, even:0.03, ever:0.04, expect:0.05, fans:0.05, fight:0.05, film:0.10, final:0.17, for:0.12, get:0.04, gets:0.05, god:0.05, good:0.06, got:0.05, great:0.09, greatest:0.06, had:0.07, half:0.05, has:0.06, have:0.10, hawkeye:0.16, he:0.12, here:0.04, hero:0.04, his:0.03, how:0.07, hulk:0.05, in:0.15, incredible:0.05, iron:0.06, is:0.23, it:0.26, jeremy:0.05, joss:0.04, just:0.03, least:0.05, let:0.05, life:0.05, like:0.03, loki:0.10, made:0.04, make:0.04, man:0.05, mark:0.04, marvel:0.03, me:0.03, might:0.06, minutes:0.06, movie:0.10, new:0.04, no:0.03, not:0.05, of:0.12, on:0.05, one:0.09, only:0.07, or:0.03, over:0.04, own:0.05, packed:0.05, people:0.04, place:0.12, really:0.06, renner:0.05, right:0.05, see:0.03, so:0.03, some:0.03, something:0.09, spectacular:0.06, still:0.08, storyline:0.06, super:0.04, superheroes:0.04, sure:0.10, take:0.09, takes:0.06, team:0.20, than:0.03, that:0.20, the:0.31, their:0.03, they:0.11, things:0.05, this:0.07, thor:0.03, though:0.05, thought:0.05, to:0.17, together:0.07, used:0.06, very:0.03, villain:0.09, was:0.11, we:0.04, well:0.06, went:0.06, were:0.03, what:0.03, whedon:0.07, when:0.03, which:0.03, widow:0.04, with:0.02, work:0.09, world:0.04, would:0.03, writing:0.06, york:0.06, you:0.05"

2012-05-08,"I'm a comic book nerd. I grew up on Spiderman, X-Men, and anything and everything Stan Lee and Jack Kirby helped produce. I had seen every tie-in movie, in theaters, as soon as I had a chance. I remember watching Iron Man and everyone had told me to stay after the credits because there was a huge surprise waiting for me at the end. So began the most painful 4 years of my life.In the 1960's, comic books were fun excursions into a world where magic, science, and wonder all coexisted. It was a world where it would be perfectly normal if a giant dragon, a man with the abilities of a spider, and a god straight out of Norse mythology all got into a fight to the death. I know a lot of people are going to disagree with me so I'm just going to go ahead and get to my point. The Avengers is the greatest superhero movie of all time.""But what about The Dark Knight?"" you may ask. The Dark Knight was a fantastic film in it's own regard, but that sense of wonder and mystery was replaced by realism and fear. Which is OK because you don't go to a batman movie expecting him to fight against a large supernatural force. But for me, the wonder and fantasy is what really defines a superhero story, whether it's a comic or a movie.Anyway, The Avengers were assembled perfectly. This is truly a benchmark in the movie industry; successfully combining the universes of four different movies into one; creating the grandest spectacle i have ever seen on screen. If you haven't yet, I recommend seeing all the tie-in movies before seeing The Avengers, if not for the sake that they are all great movies by themselves then for the fact that The Avengers will be a lot more enjoyable if you are already familiar with the characters.Joss Whedon has done a remarkable job of taking each of these characters, already having such strong personalities, and making them interact with each other. For me, the beauty of this movie wasn't the action scenes, it was the interactions between the characters. Whedon really understands these heroes.And speaking of action scenes, let's talk about how AWESOME the action scenes were. I was afraid that the trailer had already shown all the great moments in the film but, thankfully, I was wrong. I was really wrong. There is a plethora of fights in this movie, both between the heroes and the villains, and between the heroes themselves. And every hero gets their moments in the limelight. Even Black Widow and Hawkeye, who I was worried might bog down the fights, were just as much of a part of the team as Thor and Iron Man were. But, let's be honest here, this is the Hulk's movie. Hulk had disappointed me in most of his previous movie outings, but not this time. Joss Whedon finally got the character right. You can see the fear behind Banner's eyes, the sense of hopelessness in his voice. He really is cursed, but must learn to use his curse for the greater good. And when he finally does change into the Hulk, Hulk smashes. Hulk smashes a lot.The Avengers can't be passed over as a marketing scheme. It deserves every cent that it reeled in from it's opening weekend.

2012-10-20,"The Avengers I could tell you is the greatest film of our time or possibly the greatest. I came into this film with minor expectations after seeing the trailer but being a comic book fan I decided I should give it a go and mate this was one spectacular film done very well by Joss Whedon the man famous for putting together Buffy the Vampire Slayer certainly knows how to write a script with almost every line memorable and giving all the heroes a chance to do something cool with nothing left out that could ruin the plot 2012's the Avengers has done a job well done.The Avengers Iron Man/Tony Stark/Robert Downey Jr was at his very best performing with ease and I actually thought he was cool in this,Chris Hemsworth plays the Norse god Thor who was just awesome in this film and showed.Hawkeye played by Jeremy Renner did a job well done especially with the arrow shots. Finally we found the perfect person to play the Hulk/Bruce Banner as Mark Ruffalo looks like a nerd and doesn't look angry in every scene like the other Hulks and made the Hulk look like a cool guy rather than the others who took it like it was a curse. Scarlett Johansen improves from her kick ass performance in Iron Man 2 to become a real person you would not want to make angry and proves to us she is in for more than just the good looks. Tom Hiddelston pulled of our villain very well and if you though he was cool in Thor he was even more cooler in this and probably the best villain since the Dark Knight. We couldn't forget Samuel L Jackson who no longer appears just at the end for a few minutes but finally brings together the avengers:)Alan Silvestri even pulled of a great job with the soundtrack and could I dare say it was better than what he had for Back to the Future well it was WAYY better than the Back to the Future soundtrack and I never thought I would say that.

2012-09-30,"The theatre in the town where I live isn't exactly pleasant, so I decided to wait until the Avengers came out on DVD to buy it. Now, understand, I am a huge Marvel fan - I've seen all the ""Avengers preludes"", I've read comics, I've watched cartoons, I had the action figures as a kid. This movie meant a ton to me, and I was hoping it would be great. And as I pressed play, and the villain, Loki, appeared, I knew I was in for an event.The Avengers exceeded my expectations by far, cementing it as one of my favourite movies of all time instantly. You could say that I'm shallow - that the Avengers is nothing more than a CG extravaganza that pales against the likes of the Dark Knight. But you're wrong.The Avengers has a heart that other superhero movies, or, even, other movies don't. It's funnier than most comedies I've seen. It succeeds in not taking itself so deathly seriously that it loses what makes a superhero movie a superhero movie - it relishes the implausibility of what's happening. At the same time, however, it's technically fantastic. It's well-acted. The characters are well-fleshed out, likable, and receive a lot of development, and Joss Whedon expertly juggles every single hero Marvel threw at him. Everyone feels like they belong on the team, even Black Widow - who I was worried was going to be 'the female character', ended up being a standout in the movie. The dialogue is fantastic, and I was very impressed with the pace.

One of the things that helped this movie was all the main heroes were in their own movies so they could be given back story. This was a good idea cause doing back story for all of them in one movie would have been impossible. It has a bunch of memorable scenes that make you love the characters even more. The final fight scene is definitely the best part were they finally are together to make their stand against the enemy. It does have some minor flaws but this movie definitely makes up for all the flaws. Some people thought this movie would be bad because of too many heroes in the same movie, but if anything this proves you can make a movie with all these different heroes and be awesome.

2012-05-02,"I was fortunate enough to watch a special presentation of the The Avengers earlier this week. Due to the sheer awesomeness of the movie I felt it was appropriate to spread the good word. I'll try not to ruin too much for you though interested parties know the basic plot by now.A group of super-people; Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor/...Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and The Incredible Hulk/Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) are brought together by a top secret task force known as S.H.I.E.L.D. to form a super team known as The Avengers. S.H.I.E.L.D., headed by superspy Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and a huge, expensive looking, airborne armada, face a serious threat in the form of super-villain Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Can The Avengers' divergent personalities come together to face such a large external threat? If they do, will the audience care? The answer is of course yes, and yes. The Avengers is less of a movie than it is a dazzling visual experience. My bet is those who lived in the time of 5 cent Captain America comics would have their minds blown by the sheer size and grandior of this flick. Its big, its bold and it delivers. But enough with general platitudes. What specifically makes The Avengers such great summer fare? Well for one it takes four characters who have dawned their own movie franchises and brings them together for the first time. Since we all know their origins, their powers and their basic personalities, this spin-off is in a unique position to expand the world in which these superheroes exist. This world of course has a lot of explosions and movie monsters, but it also has a fair amount of heart and humor too.All due credit must be given to its smart script provided by Joss Whedon and Zak Penn who seemed to have had just as much fun writing the movie as I did watching it. Every scene has a purpose and nearly every joke hits its mark. That not to say the movie is all fun and games. The movie wisely shines a light on the back story of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), two characters who have been largely in the shadows in the past. This allows, especially Black Widow's character arc to become the convincing emotional core of the film. There is one confrontation between Black Widow and Loki that provided no whizz-bang vulgarities but nonetheless was an uncommonly dark and emotionally charged moment. One I wouldn't expect from such an unabashedly popcorny flick.The character of Loki has improved greatly from the last time we saw him in Thor (2011). I found him a bit too unassuming and snively to really be threatening in 2011. This year however Tom Hiddleston has wisely cranked the diva dial up to 11 and lets loose. Its hard not to soak up all his bravura. Or Samuel L. Jackson's for that matter. He's supposed to be Nick Fury and god love him for trying but he'll always be Samuel L. and that's not all together a bad thing.There are however some slight faults to this otherwise solid film. I know its unfair since The Avengers is a sequel of sorts but there seemed to be too little development or back story about our main heroes. I don't want to say that those who haven't seen the other Marvel movies will be completely lost but I doubt they'll have the same emotional investment in the characters coming in from the cold. A few lines of exposition without them sharing witty banter would have been enough; I'm not greedy. Also, and this is just my personal bias, Mark Ruffalo did his best but I was not convinced he was Bruce Banner. His lax, California, too-cool-for-school delivery just didn't mesh well with the sci-fi jargon he and Tony Stark were spewing.Regardless of a few shortcomings, The Avengers is a profoundly entertaining movie with great action, great acting and a fun script. It sets the new gold standard comic-book superhero films have to reach in the years to come.

IMDb you should be a shamed by letting all these obviously underaged virgins that wouldn't know true filmmaking if it bitchslapped them in the face.

If those two elements are in a film for you the character development, creative ideas, acting, script, and cinematography doesn't matter which is very sad and leads me to worry about the misleading rating system for the future of filmmaking. This amateur film is currently rated 101 on IMDb.

2012-05-02,"Its not been exactly one hour when I came out watching this incredible movie.I was ever excited to watch the movie and with the same excitement I'm writing of this review for it.Simply,the movie is AWESOME.Special effects out of the world,a justified role distribution and superb script writing.And if you think all this a little less to mark a movie as a blockbuster then watch out the star cast.ROBERT DOWNEY JR. can be said as the only super hero who wins fight before starting it, with his verbal missiles attack.No matter who he is standing before Loki,Thor,Captain America or the green monster Hulk....each time he has shown that he is the best actor among all of them.Although all of the others played their respective superb action pack roles very good.Story is been good right from the beginning and the movie goes higher and higher in action as well as in story.Every Super hero will give you a chance to scream and shout ""wooooo"" with applauding your hands. Generally,the main platform of a 3D movie is Action and Avengers justifies on this word.

2012-11-12,"Marvel's The Avengers is a 2012 American superhero film produced by Marvel Studios. The beginning of the movie focuses on the re-building of the Avengers team. In The Avengers, Nick Fury, director of the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor's adoptive brother Loki from overpowering Earth. Loki, with his long and flowing hair, had teamed up with the alien race. Together they tried to steal the Tesseract, which, in turn, could destroy the world. Captain America was the first to be introduced. He started in World War II and was awoken in 2011.He was the first member of the Avengers team. Each member of the team had a unique characteristic. The Hulk had enormous strength, Captain America in bravery, Iron Man's had ability to fly, Thor's unbearable hammer, Black Widow in sexiness, and Hawkeye's unbeatable arrows. The biggest challenge happened in the beginning of the movie, when the Avengers had to face each other. The argument of how to approach Loki turned the members away from each other. Whedon, the director, forced his heroes against one another to get them to bond. This movie was mainly classified as action and adventure.The Hulk played a huge role in the making of this film. Having lived his life previously to fighting and not having the ability to control his body, he moved to India. With the thought that he would be able to live a ""normal"" life, Bruce Banner was happy with his decision. Unfortunately, the Avengers needed him to become the Hulk again. Now not only does he have to deal with his anger management problem, but also with depression and self-hatred. Overall, the movie was well put together. Between the graphics and the 3-D realization, one would feel to play a part in this movie. Although the 220 million dollar film had a plot line that will leave viewers breathless, it could also be confusing to others. Since it is a continuation, some people who haven't seen the previous five movies or know the storyline of the Avengers could get lost. However, Whedon does an excellent job at trying to catch new viewers up. Will the Avengers recover from lost time and defeat Loki, or will the Earth be destroyed? From the comic books to live film, The Avengers is an excellent movie for all ages.",8.0,2012-11,Monday,"2012:0.05, able:0.05, action:0.02, again:0.04, against:0.05, alien:0.05, all:0.02, also:0.06, although:0.05, america:0.08, an:0.05, and:0.13, another:0.04, as:0.02, at:0.03, avengers:0.19, away:0.05, banner:0.04, be:0.09, become:0.06, beginning:0.11, between:0.04, biggest:0.06, black:0.03, brother:0.05, bruce:0.04, but:0.02, by:0.03, captain:0.09, comic:0.03, could:0.10, director:0.08, does:0.07, each:0.10, earth:0.08, excellent:0.10, face:0.06, feel:0.04, fighting:0.05, film:0.10, first:0.06, for:0.02, from:0.10, fury:0.04, get:0.06, had:0.19, have:0.02, haven:0.05, having:0.10, hawkeye:0.04, he:0.14, heroes:0.03, him:0.04, his:0.18, how:0.03, however:0.04, huge:0.05, hulk:0.10, in:0.15, iron:0.05, is:0.05, it:0.03, job:0.04, know:0.04, life:0.09, line:0.05, loki:0.12, long:0.04, making:0.05, man:0.05, marvel:0.05, movie:0.11, movies:0.03, must:0.04, new:0.04, nick:0.04, not:0.04, now:0.04, of:0.14, on:0.02, one:0.04, only:0.03, or:0.06, other:0.06, others:0.05, overall:0.05, part:0.04, people:0.04, play:0.05, played:0.05, plot:0.04, previous:0.05, put:0.05, re:0.05, role:0.05, seen:0.03, since:0.04, some:0.03, stop:0.05, storyline:0.05, superhero:0.03, team:0.15, tesseract:0.05, that:0.05, the:0.58, them:0.03, they:0.02, this:0.05, thor:0.08, thought:0.04, time:0.03, to:0.28, together:0.06, up:0.06, was:0.12, well:0.03, whedon:0.06, when:0.03, which:0.03, who:0.03, widow:0.03, will:0.09, with:0.12, world:0.08, would:0.06"
2012-09-01,"This film can only be rated in contrast with other superhero movies and, as such, it's above average. The only way it can be described is a Marvel extravaganza. When one gladiator doesn't excite the crowd anymore, you bring out the whole ludus!But of course, what many people forget about comic book superheroes is that they came from, well, comic books. They have stories that people have thought out long before there was any idea of making a movie. Not the best literature can provide, but something like character development and a plot. So if you bring all these stories together, you'd better be careful how you do it.I am glad to say that The Avengers did not botch this. The story was reasonable. The fighting scenes were epic, even if totally unrealistic, the special effects grandiose, but not overly so.

2012-05-02,"There are four films this year I am banking on being at the top of my list and Avengers Assemble was the lesser. My god 2012 going to be a good year for movies!Marvel Studios colossal gamble in combining four of their major comic brands into one film was subject to feeling clustered and failing, yet having gotten each hero's back story and characteristics out of the way in previous films, Avengers can go all out. No brakes. ""Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist"" Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) is teamed up with Doctor Bruce Banner (The Incredible Hulk) Steve Rogers (the super soldier Captain America) and Thor, the god of thunder, to protect the world from a hostile invasion led by Thor's brother Loki. They have to learn to put their personal demons aside and work together if they are to succeed!Avengers Assemble is another landmark in cinema after Harry Potter; keeping firm continuity on a franchise makes it stronger. The actors already know their characters, the film's first act dips wonderfully into ""character moments"", one minute it is a new Iron Man film, then it is Thor's movie, Avengers simply revels in their clashing personalities, a geeky ""what if Thor, Tony Stark and Captain America were in a room together?"". I cannot stress the credit due to Joss Whedon, co-writer and director, he brought is A-game here; the wit and stinging dialogue is here in abundance. The cinema I was in was roaring with laughter at all the right points. There are several short signature fights, giving each hero and villain a chance to fight another, though this does not feel forced. Instead each battle feels unique, memorable and is certainly eye catching.The film's heart and soul is with the superheroes, and while their personal demons are less defined here (for obvious reasons, there are six of them!) the battles they wage show them struggling, Marvel's ethos of ""human superheroes"" is not completely lost here. By the end, the heroes are quite worse for wear. Loki is the signature villain, and one should watch Thor (and Captain America) to fully appreciate what's at stake. The villains are pushed aside overall, but only for the excellent team-building theme the film is about anyway.Definitely worth seeing, for the great dialogue alone, never mind the frantic and characterful battle sequences on top of it!",10.0,2012-05,Wednesday,"2012:0.06, about:0.03, actors:0.05, after:0.04, all:0.05, already:0.06, am:0.05, america:0.10, and:0.26, another:0.10, are:0.19, assemble:0.12, at:0.09, avengers:0.10, back:0.05, banner:0.05, battle:0.10, be:0.03, being:0.04, brother:0.06, brought:0.06, bruce:0.05, but:0.02, by:0.06, can:0.03, captain:0.10, certainly:0.07, character:0.03, characters:0.03, cinema:0.12, comic:0.04, definitely:0.05, dialogue:0.12, director:0.05, does:0.04, each:0.12, end:0.05, excellent:0.06, feel:0.05, feels:0.06, fight:0.05, film:0.14, films:0.08, first:0.04, for:0.11, four:0.14, franchise:0.06, from:0.03, giving:0.06, go:0.04, god:0.11, going:0.05, good:0.03, great:0.03, have:0.03, having:0.06, he:0.03, here:0.19, hero:0.09, heroes:0.04, hulk:0.03, if:0.07, in:0.14, incredible:0.05, instead:0.07, into:0.08, iron:0.06, is:0.21, it:0.08, joss:0.04, know:0.04, less:0.06, loki:0.07, makes:0.05, man:0.06, marvel:0.06, mind:0.06, moments:0.05, movie:0.02, movies:0.03, my:0.06, never:0.04, new:0.05, no:0.04, not:0.05, of:0.13, on:0.08, one:0.08, only:0.04, out:0.06, overall:0.05, previous:0.05, put:0.05, quite:0.05, right:0.05, seeing:0.05, sequences:0.06, short:0.06, should:0.05, show:0.06, simply:0.06, stark:0.10, story:0.03, super:0.04, superheroes:0.09, team:0.04, the:0.41, their:0.17, them:0.07, then:0.04, there:0.09, they:0.09, this:0.04, thor:0.16, though:0.05, to:0.16, together:0.07, tony:0.10, top:0.11, up:0.03, villain:0.09, was:0.09, watch:0.04, way:0.04, were:0.04, what:0.06, whedon:0.04, while:0.05, with:0.07, work:0.05, world:0.05, worth:0.05, year:0.11, yet:0.06"
2012-09-05,"This film is a steaming pile of turd. I've never disliked Joss Whedon, I love Buffy and Firefly/Serenity but he's not a very good director. The actors seem to suffer as much confusion as their characters do almost like, as torn as they are to join Shield and The Avengers in the film is how torn the actors must feel from scene to scene as to why they're even in this film.Captain America does not seem like a 1930's man, I've seen better period acting in Mad Men and the like, I was looking for some authenticity in him. Thor is paying so much attention to his hair he seems to have forgotten his point. And Scarlett Johansson is horrific, she's so monotonously apathetic it shines through in her character and the only part of her face that shows any sign of acting is her eyebrow, when it raises at one point. The left one it was.And this film is the longest bad film I've ever had the stupidity to watch.Another point that peeved me is that the action is so ridiculously loud but the speaking so quiet in comparison, it was like every explosion was happening inside my head and every conversation was in the next room over and I was listening in.The Avengers gets 1 point for the team dynamic, when they're altogether it's interesting to watch, and 2 points for Robert Downey Jr, he's a whole lot of man but even his humour and acting is outweighed by the stink of the rest of the film, so it gets 3 out of 10 from me and a black mark against Mark Ruffalo who was a credible actor in my eyes.",3.0,2012-09,Wednesday,"10:0.05, acting:0.16, action:0.03, actor:0.07, actors:0.11, against:0.07, almost:0.06, america:0.04, and:0.22, another:0.06, any:0.05, are:0.03, as:0.14, at:0.04, avengers:0.06, bad:0.05, better:0.05, black:0.05, but:0.08, by:0.04, captain:0.04, character:0.04, characters:0.03, director:0.06, do:0.05, does:0.05, downey:0.05, even:0.08, ever:0.05, every:0.10, face:0.08, feel:0.06, film:0.20, for:0.08, from:0.07, gets:0.13, good:0.03, had:0.04, have:0.03, he:0.12, her:0.21, him:0.05, his:0.12, how:0.05, humour:0.08, in:0.21, interesting:0.07, is:0.20, it:0.13, johansson:0.06, joss:0.04, jr:0.05, left:0.07, like:0.13, looking:0.07, lot:0.05, love:0.06, man:0.07, mark:0.09, me:0.08, much:0.08, must:0.06, my:0.07, never:0.05, next:0.07, not:0.06, of:0.15, one:0.06, only:0.04, out:0.04, over:0.05, part:0.06, point:0.26, re:0.12, rest:0.07, robert:0.05, ruffalo:0.05, scarlett:0.05, scene:0.11, seem:0.15, seems:0.07, seen:0.05, she:0.07, so:0.17, some:0.04, team:0.05, that:0.07, the:0.33, their:0.04, they:0.10, this:0.07, thor:0.04, through:0.06, to:0.17, ve:0.16, very:0.04, was:0.19, watch:0.08, whedon:0.04, when:0.08, who:0.04, whole:0.06, why:0.06"
2012-05-08,"Hyped as the greatest superhero film ever made, 2012's ""The Avengers"" is an entertaining superhero team flick. Loki (Tom Hiddleston), introduced in 2011's ""Thor,"" comes to earth intent on an otherworldly invasion and total conquest. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) of the Federal agency S.H.I.E.L.D. gathers together ""earth's mightiest heroes"" to prevent the invasion – Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, The Black Widow, Hawkeye and, believe it or not, the Hulk.The film's hype and record-breaking success raises expectations that are letdown by a set-up that goes on & on and isn't overly absorbing, plus way too much time is spent on the SHIELD heli-carrier, which creates a somewhat one-dimensional vibe. Lastly, although Loki is an excellent villain, the otherworldly army known as the Chitauri are stereotypically ee-vil, faceless villains who are way too-easily slaughtered, excepting the colossal mechanical snake-creatures.Despite those few negatives, there are numerous highlights: Scarlett Johannson as Black Widow; straight-laced and Old-fashioned Captain America at odds with the overly-hip Tony Stark/Iron Man (Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. respectively); Chris Hemsworth as the noble Thor; Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury; a touching subplot concerning the Black Widow & Hawkeye (Jeremey Renner); and Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner.Speaking of Bruce Banner, the Hulk easily steals the show. The best scenes and literal punch lines have to do with the Hulk. As much as I like both the '03 and '08 film versions of the green goliath, this is the definitive rendition.FINAL WORD: ""The Avengers"" is definitely an entertaining superhero team flick, but it has its shortcomings. A slow build-up, the one-dimensional setting and a weak army of foes work against the movie, but it's filled with a myriad highlights, including the Hulk and the witty dialog.

2012-05-05,"Greetings again from the darkness. The concern coming in was that this would be like an All-Star game, which as any sports fan will tell you, is typically a massive letdown. Assembling so many super heroes and colorful characters into one movie: Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Nick Fury, and Loki ... would probably lead to either mass confusion, a 4 hour movie, or short straws for a couple of characters. Somehow director Joss Whedon has avoided the pitfalls and delivered a huge action film that is loads of fun for everyone, including the fanboys.Whedon does a remarkable job of giving each character their fair share of screen time, and somehow manages to make the interaction between the characters the best part of the movie. There is some terrific dialogue and the number of quick-witted exchanges are too numerous to recount. While this would be expected from Robert Downey, Jr's Iron Man, I must admit to being pleasantly surprised at Chris Hemsworth's Thor and especially Mark Ruffalo's Dr Banner/Hulk. The movie contains quite a few laugh outloud moments, which is pretty impressive in a filled theatre.If you are going to combine six super heroes in a movie, you need a bad guy. A villain. Actually, a super villain. Tom Hiddleston as Loki is up to the task. For me, he was a weak link in Thor, but here is a full-fledged, powerful evil mastermind looking to gain power by stealing the Tesseract (Cosmic Cube), commanding an alien army, and ruling earth. Hiddleston is clearly having fun and it shows. For the movie to work at all, his plan and power must stand up to the impressive line up of good guys he is fighting. That is certainly the case.Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow has come a long way from her brief work in Iron Man2, and we really get to know more about Natasha the Russian spy ... although her accent fades in and out. Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye seems a bit out of place, but Renner is so cool, we don't really care. Chris Evans as Captain America does a wonderful job of taking control of the band of misfits and displays the leadership expected of a super-soldier. We even get a good dose of Agent Coulson (Phil to his friends) and Clark Gregg's deadpan deliver is a great addition. Samuel L Jackson (as Nick Fury) will be adding hundreds of millions more to his current record of being the highest-grossing actor of all-time.Gwyneth Paltrow is back as Pepper Potts. Since last we saw her, she has evidently been shopping for short shorts and helping design the new Stark Tower. Natalie Portman makes a creative cameo, reprising her awful role in Thor. Stellan Skarsgard is back as a believable scientist. Powers Boothe appears as a member of the Council that Fury reports to. The great Harry Dean Stanton has a comical scene as a security guard who stumbles onto Hulk's mess. And of course, Stan Lee makes his well-deserved cameo appearance - a tradition in the Marvel movies.Much of the credit for this must go to Joss Whedon. He may finally be out of his Buffy the Vampire Slayer shadow, as this movie is quite an accomplishment. Entertaining and funny for the masses, yet detailed enough for the comic book fan boys. I was thinking how much fun this would be for a 10-12 year old, and how my mind might have exploded if something like this existed in my childhood.

Tony Stark adds excellent spark and quick one liners, just as he does in Ironman 1&2. Thor, Captain America and Hawkeye all play there part in taking down Loki and his army of aliens but for me the HULK is, for the first time in a movie, genuinely scary and fierce as he destroys almost everything in his path. The film really works as it stays well clear of any LOVE interest that slows down so many other superhero films. Black Widow is the female lead and she kicks butt with the best of them.

2012-05-30,"To the furthest expectation I didn't give this movie anything above the transformer series ,thought from the trailers it will be all boom boom etc. I did have an idea that there will be a great Iron Man comedian in the nice armor suit though, but I give it all up for Joss Whedon and his writer friends for creating an extraordinary mix of superhero gang movie. The movie frankly did have a slow start but from the point where we see Tony Stark and Thor in ""Shakespeare in the park"" scene the movie hits of with a non stop action mixed with a very above average hilariousness. Every super hero even Capt.Nick gets a personal intro in the movie each of them better than the other . By the way should mention the Hulk of this movie separately, even though this was his first notable appearance as a super hero or in an action role and that too with other guys who are extremely or slightly experienced in action movies , Mark Ruffalo did stand out from most of the them. Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey Jr. were fabulous and incredibly entertaining as usual .Chris Hemsworth proves he is better along with his buddies than alone like in his own Thor movie. Tom Hiddleston steels every scene he is in and makes his mark as a great actor. Jeremy Renner , as of for him i really feel like they did make him wait in line to the last with the least important role if there is any in the six of The Avengers. You can really pull that out from the movie. But his Hawk-eye is a brilliant display equally to others.Overall the movie is a great success in my eyes and its worth the while to wait for a sequel. Apart from all hulk is funny in this movie something you don't see everyday.

2012-06-21,"With the high budget this film had, I should not be noticing the staging. ""OK, Mark, you stand there and look annoyed but knowing, Scarlett, look like you're pondering, Chris, focus on keeping some of the accent but not all of it . . . "" There was no scene in the film where I didn't see with my mind's eye the director on set barking stage direction. Perhaps if the script had been stronger, I wouldn't have noticed. But pair a weak script with a long series of obviously staged (and very non-dynamic) scenes, and you end up with more flat scenes than I can count. Character development: With this cadre of fun and interesting actors and the huge budget that hired them, you'd think you'd end up with quality oozing out of the screen. No. Robert Downey's Stark was one- note, snarkie, and that's it. A few fun lines, but zero cleverness and no depth. The same with the rest of them. Except for Mark R. and Scarlet J. They were the only two who created anything interesting with their parts - and of these two, Mark R. created a genuinely interesting character in Banner. CGI: Big budgets mean you shouldn't notice the CGI. In one scene in particular, it was obvious that the actors were in front of a green screen, with the CGI added later. They should blend into the CGI not stand apart and obviously in front of it. Script: Could the script have been more plodding and obvious? It was not a smart or clever script.

2012-05-04,"""The Avengers"" is not an average action flick. In fact, it is an excellent one. The success of this film relies not only on the spectacular visual effects and sustained action sequences, but mostly on the characters and the interactions between them. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, the Hulk, and Hawkeye are treat to watch as they kick ass, exchange clever one-liners, and desperately work together to fight off Loki and his minions. Each actor portrays their character with zeal and believability. We don't just see Robert Downey Jr. sarcastic nature or the ripped biceps of Chris Evans. We see Tony Stark/Iron Man and Captain America saving the world from certain demise. As a result, we find ourselves cheering them on! This is what makes a great super hero flick! RDJ does get most of the lines, but he does not steal the show entirely from the other characters for they have a chance to develop too.For nearly a 2 hour and 30 minute film, ""The Avengers"" flies by. The action scenes are not just big explosions and blatant CGI (one sequence in particular is reminiscent to the destruction of Chicago in Transformers: Dark of the Moon), but there are several one-on-one fights with the super heroes and the villain. Not trying to give any spoilers, but the fight between Thor and The Hulk is a true, visual effects feast and a well-choreographed sequence. Some of the action scenes are very long, but unlike the last few Michael Bay films, I found myself begging for more. The plot is nothing special or too memorable. However, it is easy to follow Anyone who has not seen some of the other action films (ex: Thor, Captain America, Iron Man) will not be confused, for the scriptwriters made ""The Avengers"" a film of its own, and not a crossover of the other features. It is worth noting that the writers also pack a lot of witty and sometimes unpredictable humor into the mix. To sum up, ""The Avengers"" is the best super hero flick I have seen years. It has everything I ask for in the genre.",10.0,2012-05,Friday,"action:0.14, actor:0.06, also:0.04, america:0.10, an:0.06, and:0.25, any:0.04, anyone:0.06, are:0.11, as:0.05, avengers:0.10, be:0.03, best:0.03, between:0.10, big:0.04, black:0.04, but:0.11, by:0.03, captain:0.10, cgi:0.05, character:0.04, characters:0.06, chris:0.05, dark:0.05, does:0.09, don:0.04, downey:0.04, each:0.04, effects:0.08, evans:0.05, everything:0.05, excellent:0.06, fact:0.06, few:0.05, fight:0.10, film:0.09, films:0.08, find:0.06, for:0.11, found:0.07, from:0.06, genre:0.06, get:0.04, give:0.05, great:0.03, has:0.06, have:0.05, hawkeye:0.04, he:0.03, hero:0.10, heroes:0.04, his:0.04, hour:0.07, however:0.05, hulk:0.06, humor:0.05, in:0.08, into:0.04, iron:0.09, is:0.18, it:0.08, its:0.04, jr:0.04, just:0.06, last:0.05, lines:0.06, loki:0.04, long:0.05, lot:0.05, made:0.04, makes:0.05, man:0.09, more:0.03, most:0.04, not:0.21, nothing:0.05, of:0.18, off:0.05, on:0.11, one:0.13, only:0.04, or:0.07, other:0.11, own:0.05, plot:0.04, robert:0.04, scenes:0.08, see:0.07, seen:0.08, sequences:0.06, show:0.06, some:0.07, special:0.05, spectacular:0.07, stark:0.05, super:0.14, that:0.02, the:0.54, their:0.03, them:0.07, there:0.03, they:0.06, this:0.04, thor:0.10, to:0.13, together:0.04, tony:0.05, too:0.08, transformers:0.06, true:0.06, up:0.03, very:0.04, villain:0.05, visual:0.12, watch:0.04, we:0.12, well:0.03, what:0.03, who:0.04, widow:0.04, will:0.03, with:0.05, witty:0.06, work:0.05, world:0.05, worth:0.06, years:0.05"
2015-03-15,"I was so happy when this movie was announced. As I noted in my review of ""Captain America: The First Avenger"", Cap is my all time favorite comic book super hero, which of course makes me a de facto Avengers fan. I was so happy to see this film come to life and for Marvel to be able to pull off something as grandiose as this movie. And then when the movie came out, it was awesome! Amazing! Over the top--one of the best action movies ever made!And I still feel that way. ""The Avengers"" rocks. It really is a superb film. The action was great. The characters were great. The story was great. Everything was great.But now, fast forward three years, and I've watched all the Marvel movies numerous times, and there are other MCU movies that have been made since then, too. And so I sat down to watch ""The Avengers"" again the other night....and.....well........I guess familiarity breeds contempt?The movie is still great, but I suppose that after several viewings it gets sort of repetitious and you see the imperfections a bit more. Hemsworth is not up to the standard he set for himself in ""Thor"", for example; or the contrived notion of Coulson's death pulling the team together.

2012-05-04,"Being a kid that grew up with comics eventually does come down to some basic questions that must be answered: Who would win in a fight between Thor and Hulk? Between Hulk and Iron-Man? Does Captain America stand a chance against a God of Asgard? All these answers have been partially answered through the comic medium; however, seeing this childhood memory play in front of your eyes (and in 3D) is quite the eye opener.The Avengers is not an origins movie. Which means, a story must be told! Mr. Whedon did the super hero genre an immense favor by achieving what almost no one else managed in the last 12 years: he filmed a comic book! The ""Avengers"" is a typical MARVEL story, its recipe being the one that kept comics popular for the last 60 years or so: Bad guy makes move; good guys make a stand but fail because they are divided; through their loss they understand they must unite, and united they win.MARVEL delivers on all levels: It knows that Robert Downey Jr is the movie's super star, so not only he gets the longest screen time, but he also has the funniest lines AND proves to be a better man that he believes. Chris Hemsworth is a better Thor than last time. Mark Ruffalo steals the show as Bruce Banner/Hulk, making this the only worthwhile appearance of the character on celluloid. Captain America does not quite live up to the challenge, but Mr. Whedon knows how to use the character in a valuable way. As a result, all the scenes between the movie's big heroes (with big egos) are smart, funny, and keep getting better and better.The film's visual/sound effects are magnificent and 3D make this movie an unforgettable experience, so do yourself a favor and watch it in a cinema. The action scenes are a wonderful cocktail of action&humor that comes across very successfully, as over-dramatization in this kind of films usually proves ridiculous. MARVEL was very lucky in making a fantastic Iron-Man movie out of the blue (mostly thanks to the talent of Robert Downey Jr), while the other three films that introduced the Avengers characters were rather average (Captain America, Thor, Hulk 2). This made a lot of people, including myself, very uncertain about whether the Avengers movie would not be the biggest flop of them all. I was extremely surprised to see a film that delivers on all levels and is, in my opinion, the best super hero movie MARVEL has ever made. This is a personal triumph for Mr. Whedon, who scripted and directed (rather modestly) a film that could had failed in so many different ways. It is also a great achievement for the production team, the all-star cast and the crew, who cooperated successfully to manage a very fine balance between action, comedy and special effects.If you like comic books, this is single-handedly the best super hero movie since X-Men2.

2020-09-07,"Pros:
1. The score gives the film a lively and adventurous feel, particularly the vibrant Avengers theme tune.
2. The CGI mostly looks great, and is mixed expertly with the practical effects to keep it grounded.
3. The action scenes are choreographed well and are very entertaining to watch.
4. There is excellent chemistry between all of the actors, especially those playing the avengers.
5. For the most part, the set and costume design is brilliant and they build the world perfectly.
6. The humour produces many laughs, is inserted appropriately, and never outstays its welcome.
7. Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark/ Iron Man), Scarlett Johansson (Natasha Romanoff/ Black Widow), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), and Mark Ruffalo (Bruce Banner/ The Hulk) deliver fantastic performances.
8. The character altercations and progressions are handled deftly, as well as concluded nicely.
9. The battle for New York is exceedingly epic and impressive, in regards to its scale, the high stakes, and the visuals.Cons:
1. There is a distractingly high overuse of dutch angles.
2. The Captain America (Chris Evans) suit looks a little cheap and tacky.

2012-04-29,"Putting Thor, Hulk, Captain America and Iron Man all into one film was never going to be easy, what with die-hard fans of certain characters demanding they each have their moment to shine. However, Joss Whedon succeeds in creating such a balanced film with a huge cast, he makes it look effortless. Avengers Assember/ The Avengers (take your pick) is one of the best films of the year and it hard to think of any other director who could have pulled it off. Sure there are many other great directors out there, but Whedon ensures that you don't to have of read the comics to appreciate this. The cast, direction, the script, the editing (very smooth), cgi, cinematography etc is amazing but I'm sure this has already been a lot mentioned about it. What made the film for me personally is the sense of camaraderie between all the characters as they work together, that is essential in any war/ team film that depicts people working together. Each character is also nicely developed, particularly Bruce Banner aka Hulk. Supporting members including Nick Fury, Hawkeye and Black Widow are also given their time to shine, and each actor is well cast. While Loki's motif could have seen a little more development, the film feels nicely rounded and the action is amazing to watch as New York is torn apart. The film is funny in places but never feels goofy or unnecessary (pay attention Michael Bay). Whedon's ability to keep the action fresh ensures that this film never falters and becomes tired. Avengers Assemble is an amazing film that gives the audience what they want and more, and is a sure contender for the best superhero film to date. While The Dark Knight Rises comes closer to its release, it is important to note that these are two very different films. Regardless, there is something for everyone and I strongly recommend watching it on the big screen.",8.0,2012-04,Sunday,"about:0.04, action:0.06, actor:0.07, all:0.05, already:0.06, also:0.08, amazing:0.15, america:0.04, an:0.03, and:0.18, any:0.09, are:0.09, as:0.06, assemble:0.07, audience:0.06, avengers:0.08, banner:0.05, be:0.03, been:0.04, best:0.08, between:0.05, big:0.05, black:0.04, bruce:0.06, but:0.08, captain:0.04, cast:0.15, cgi:0.06, character:0.04, characters:0.07, comes:0.06, comics:0.06, could:0.09, dark:0.06, development:0.06, different:0.06, director:0.05, don:0.04, each:0.13, everyone:0.05, fans:0.06, feels:0.14, film:0.29, films:0.09, for:0.08, funny:0.06, fury:0.05, given:0.07, going:0.05, great:0.04, hard:0.12, has:0.04, have:0.12, hawkeye:0.05, he:0.04, however:0.06, huge:0.06, hulk:0.06, in:0.07, into:0.04, iron:0.03, is:0.28, it:0.13, its:0.04, joss:0.04, keep:0.07, knight:0.06, little:0.05, loki:0.04, look:0.06, lot:0.05, made:0.04, makes:0.05, man:0.03, many:0.05, me:0.04, moment:0.07, more:0.07, never:0.15, new:0.05, nick:0.05, of:0.12, off:0.05, on:0.03, one:0.06, or:0.04, other:0.08, out:0.04, people:0.05, read:0.07, recommend:0.07, screen:0.05, script:0.06, seen:0.05, sense:0.07, something:0.05, such:0.06, superhero:0.04, sure:0.18, take:0.06, team:0.05, that:0.14, the:0.34, their:0.08, there:0.10, these:0.05, they:0.10, think:0.05, this:0.06, thor:0.04, time:0.04, to:0.23, together:0.08, two:0.06, very:0.08, want:0.06, was:0.03, watch:0.04, watching:0.05, well:0.04, what:0.11, whedon:0.13, while:0.11, who:0.04, widow:0.05, with:0.05, work:0.05, year:0.06, york:0.07, you:0.03, your:0.05"
2012-12-26,"It was inevitable that The Avengers would be made, especially with the cinematic gold that was produced with the Iron Man franchise, Thor, and Captain America (though the Hulk films have struggled to find any kind of footing to speak of). In this critic's opinion, the individual productions dedicated to the aforementioned superheroes ranged from spectacular to borderline dreadful (I was especially disappointed in Captain America). To think that any one person could somehow blend all of these characters' story lines into something coherent—and, as implausible as it seemed, genuinely entertained—made me more than skeptical.But, as the saying goes, never say never. The Avengers is a spectacle to behold; it's thrilling, funny, and actually musters up quite a bit of unexpected character development. How about that?What makes it so fantastic is the fact that nearly every major player is given equal screen time. Wisely, Whedon decided to paint these otherworldly heroes flesh tone—that is, he makes them entirely human. Instead of being fodder for CGI carnage (which, paradoxically, they are, in a very good way) we become invested in them as individuals. They have their problems, and never is this more relevant than when egos collide aboard a floating fortress—a scene that almost sees the would be saviors of the world nearly tear themselves apart. Another well-played decision on the part of Whedon was to play up the sociological angle of the mayhem taking place. Specifically, the fact that the battle for humanity eventually moves to the streets of New York City evokes feelings directly reminiscent of the 9/11 attacks. This strikes a particularly vulnerable chord in most of us; even though it's been 11 years since the horror of that September morning unfolded, a general sense of unease still permeates our contemporary culture. The fact that The Avengers draws such clear cut lines between ""good"" and ""evil"" makes it unexpectedly powerful, and the musings by many of the characters that the world could do with a little ""old fashioned"" reverie is certainly a well-founded one.Actually, I have only one gripe with the movie. It's probably too minor in many people's eyes to warrant mentioning, but, in light of the myriad accomplishments that define the movie, I simply can't ignore it. Specifically, it has to do with the Hulk's sudden ability to control his rage in such a way as to be mindful of what he is and isn't smashing. No explanation is given as to how he's able to do this in a hairpin moment of critical importance, and it's something that could have been easily resolved with a quick bit of dialogue or a thirty second scene.For everything that could have gone wrong with The Avengers, it's a miracle that it's actually watchable; actually, it's a wonderful piece of cinema, not to mention one of the best action movies that I've ever seen.

I love to see them talk and argue (although it can be a little grating on rewatch since we've already see them become friends).Those are my favorite moments of this movie. Scenes like Tony talking to Bruce about how the Hulk saved his life, Steve and Coulson chatting on the way to the helicarrier and Steve and Tony arguing about sacrifice (something which will be payed off in Endgame).It's simple. You take a bunch of characters I like and put them in a room together. That's what most of this movie is and that's why I like it so much.

2012-05-04,"Last year, I had similar reactions to both Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger. While they were mildly amusing, they were often quite boring, lacking any big-blockbuster spectacle, and seemed only around to lead into another film. That film of course, was The Avengers, and not only did I not appreciate a film out to only promote another movie, but I had little faith four films with such different styles and backgrounds would come together to work as one film. However, the film that Joss Whedon has made completely proved me wrong and exceeded my expectations. The Avengers may actually be the best Marvel-adaption to be in the vein of the comics. It's enormously entertaining, with witty humor, and a satisfying, engaging character driven plot.What makes the film work so well is that the filmmakers (of both The Avengers and the previous films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe) find a way to blend the characters separate mythologies into one arc that feels natural. In that sense, I have a newfound respect for Thor and Captain America, for how they properly develop their characters individually and establish their own timeline, while at the same time developing the background for some of the major plot devices in The Avengers. While Thor, and Captain America may not work as great entertainment on their own terms, when looked at as one huge overlapping arc – which also includes Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and The Incredible Hulk -, they make for a great series.Where it seems today the only way a superhero film can be great is if it's re-envisioned to be more realistic and dark in the vein of The Dark Knight or Sam Raimi's Spider Man series, Marvel's The Avengers shows that a great superhero film only needs to satisfy it's audience, with two solid hours of action-packed, energized entertainment.",9.0,2012-05,Friday,"action:0.03, actually:0.06, also:0.04, america:0.11, and:0.23, another:0.11, any:0.05, around:0.06, as:0.08, at:0.07, audience:0.06, avenger:0.06, avengers:0.14, be:0.12, best:0.04, big:0.05, blockbuster:0.06, boring:0.07, both:0.12, but:0.02, can:0.04, captain:0.11, character:0.04, characters:0.07, cinematic:0.07, come:0.05, comics:0.06, course:0.06, dark:0.11, did:0.04, different:0.06, entertaining:0.06, entertainment:0.14, expectations:0.06, feels:0.07, film:0.25, films:0.09, find:0.06, first:0.04, for:0.10, four:0.07, great:0.14, had:0.08, has:0.03, have:0.03, hours:0.07, how:0.04, however:0.06, huge:0.06, hulk:0.03, humor:0.05, if:0.04, in:0.11, incredible:0.06, into:0.09, iron:0.07, is:0.04, it:0.08, joss:0.04, knight:0.06, last:0.06, little:0.05, made:0.04, make:0.04, makes:0.05, man:0.10, marvel:0.10, may:0.12, me:0.04, more:0.04, movie:0.02, my:0.04, not:0.08, of:0.12, on:0.03, one:0.08, only:0.20, or:0.04, out:0.03, own:0.11, packed:0.06, plot:0.09, previous:0.06, quite:0.06, re:0.06, same:0.05, seemed:0.07, seems:0.07, sense:0.06, series:0.13, so:0.03, some:0.04, such:0.05, superhero:0.08, that:0.14, the:0.41, their:0.11, they:0.13, thor:0.10, time:0.03, to:0.16, together:0.04, two:0.05, universe:0.06, was:0.03, way:0.09, well:0.04, were:0.08, what:0.04, whedon:0.04, when:0.04, where:0.05, which:0.04, while:0.17, with:0.08, witty:0.07, work:0.16, would:0.04, wrong:0.07, year:0.06"

2012-05-01,"I can't say that I was that keen to see this movie, even with Joss Whedon's name attached to it - a man who has had a career in reverse, with his ""Buffy the vampire"" TV series coming across as the culmination of a career in the industry, whilst other TV series of his that I've seen not reaching those heights - but the good reviews for the film made me change my mind. This is a movie which is as superhero movies should be...a rollicking spectacle. Generally I'm pretty selective about what superhero movies I watch (haven't seen the ""Captain America"" outing as...I'm not American...jingoism doesn't sit well with me). Also, I tend to jump off a franchise pretty quickly too...Iron Man 2 was so-so, so I probably won't watch the next instalment. It will be interesting to see if this series can maintain the levels of the original. There were plenty of laugh out loud moments for me in it (I did see ""Thor"" due to some amusing clips in a movie review TV show...but the clips showed the funniest bits...and they weren't as funny in the context of the movie). No doubt Joss Whedon's time on ""Buffy the vampire slayer"" was invaluable in crafting the kind of comedy that works so well in this movie...hopefully the runaway success of this movie may see Joss given the chance to make a sequel to ""Serenity""...I want to see what that kick-arse chick is capable of!...I think the actress' name is Summer Glau...I'm not sure if Whedon has an intention to make a sequel to that movie, which was based on his okay TV series ""Firefly"".Anyway, the plot concerns Thor's younger brother Loki obtaining a device which can see him seize control of the Earth, via an unholy alliance with some ugly looking villains...and it's not clear who has the better end of that particular bargain. One of the biggest laughs I got was with Thor's comment about his relationship with Loki, after a comrade of his lists Loki's 'achievements'. Nick Fury has to assemble a team of superheroes in order to tackle Loki's allies...and there are some heavy hitters...the Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America...then a guy and a chick...if you don't lump Captain America in with the ""B"" team. The fight with Loki's allies - when it comes - is impressive. It was after finding some blockbuster franchises became ho-hum for me that I got a real kick out of the 'new wave' of superhero movies...like ""Hancock"" and ""Kick-Ass"". They were the perfect antidote to when blockbuster sequels were merely lame attempts to cash in on a superior original. Time will tell if The Avengers falls into the same trap...and if it does, it's a pity that Chloë Moretz is now too old to have that same wonderful impact that she did as Hit-Girl in ""Kick-Ass"". Anyway, if Joss is onboard for the sequels to this film, I'm onboard...for at least one more time!I saw this movie in 3D in Xtreme screen. Didn't find the 3D particularly spectacular...parts of the movie are in regular 2D too.Just by the by...I'm not that familiar with Norse mythology or whathaveyou...but I do find Thor's hammer rather lame, in an amusing kind of way...it's sort of like his handbag or something. Is it Louis Vuitton?Lastly...this movie being called ""The Avengers"", when I heard the name, I was expecting it to be about Steed and Purdie!

2012-08-20,"The culmination of Marvel's four-year, five-picture master plan is, puzzlingly, both as good as I'd hoped and a mild disappointment. It excels at playing up the larger-than-life aspects of the story, from the testy initial relationship between heroes and the looming magnitude of the threat they're called together to face. Such moments are dispersed liberally, perhaps once every five minutes, and they're an effective method of keeping the audience on the hook for the duration. What's missing, at least from where I sit, is a measure of substance or depth behind those fireworks. Robert Downey Jr. is again excellent in his nuanced interpretation of the paradoxical Tony Stark, and Mark Ruffalo might just be the best Hulk to grace the silver screen, but by comparison the rest of the cast feels quite thin, shallow and (for lack of a better word) cartoonish. Captain America, for example, wears a completely different personality than he did in his solo picture, and never feels quite right as the commanding field general he's presented to be. The most intriguing aspect of his character, an emotional detachment from modern culture, is barely even mentioned. He, and the rest of the team, feels like a suit of armor with a few good one-liners, not a living, breathing human being. It's a trap that was mostly evaded in the stars' preceding solo shots, so it's a shame to see it tripped here, especially given the amount of time and effort that was expended to define each individual's motivations. Those nitpicks certainly aren't enough to stop me from enjoying the closest thing we'll ever get to an all-splash-page crossover mega-event on the big screen, but they're also irritating enough to keep tickling the back of my mind while the next set of fuses are lit. It's a herculean effort with some truly great rewards, but not the picture-perfect ensemble masterpiece it would have you believe.",8.0,2012-08,Monday,"again:0.06, all:0.03, also:0.04, america:0.04, amount:0.08, an:0.11, and:0.17, are:0.06, as:0.09, at:0.07, audience:0.07, back:0.06, be:0.06, being:0.05, believe:0.07, best:0.04, better:0.05, between:0.06, big:0.05, both:0.07, but:0.08, by:0.04, captain:0.04, cast:0.05, certainly:0.08, character:0.04, depth:0.08, did:0.05, different:0.06, downey:0.05, each:0.05, enough:0.12, ensemble:0.08, especially:0.06, even:0.04, ever:0.05, every:0.05, excellent:0.07, face:0.08, feels:0.22, few:0.06, for:0.08, four:0.08, from:0.14, get:0.05, given:0.07, good:0.07, great:0.04, have:0.03, he:0.12, here:0.06, heroes:0.05, his:0.12, hulk:0.03, in:0.07, individual:0.08, is:0.09, it:0.13, jr:0.05, just:0.04, keep:0.07, least:0.07, life:0.06, like:0.03, ll:0.07, mark:0.05, marvel:0.04, me:0.04, might:0.07, mind:0.07, minutes:0.07, moments:0.06, most:0.05, my:0.04, never:0.05, next:0.07, not:0.06, of:0.30, on:0.06, once:0.07, one:0.03, or:0.04, perfect:0.06, quite:0.13, re:0.19, rest:0.14, right:0.06, robert:0.05, ruffalo:0.05, screen:0.10, see:0.04, set:0.07, so:0.03, some:0.04, stark:0.06, stars:0.08, stop:0.07, story:0.04, such:0.06, team:0.05, than:0.09, that:0.05, the:0.50, they:0.10, thing:0.06, those:0.11, time:0.04, to:0.17, together:0.04, tony:0.06, truly:0.07, up:0.04, was:0.06, we:0.05, what:0.04, where:0.05, while:0.06, with:0.05, would:0.04, year:0.07, you:0.03"
2012-04-29,"I'm not sure what everyone else thought about this film. I was worried, really worried. It just seemed that the studio was rushing it through.I watched it as soon as it came out, before I had even read any reviews and I have to say that so far, it's in my top 5 films of the year, easily.Joss Whedon has done a fantastic job. Each Avenger is given a good amount of time on screen with Iron Man having the lions share. The dialogue is snappy and all the actors do a great job with the script. Mark Ruffalo does a superb turn as Dr Banner as does Tom Hiddlestone as Loki (who clearly likes being the bad guy). In fact there is not one thing I could say is wrong with this film.There are a few good laughs in this as well, 2 of the best come from the Hulk. I wont spoil it for you but one of them I actually laughed out loud on (and I very rarely laugh out loud in the cinema).Overall, this is a fantastic film. One that you could watch even if you only had a small understanding of the Marvel universe.

2012-05-04,"This movie was hands down perfect! We go to movies like the Dark Knight to enjoy dark anti-heroism and deep meaning; then when we're in the mood for some good old-fashioned kick butt action and heroism, we go see Marvel movies. I for one love super heroes, sci-fi, fantasy, you name it; I'm a film buff who loves the fantastic, and there's no denying that this movie was fantastic! The direction of the action scenes was nothing short of genius; they flowed perfectly from hero to hero without even changing the camera. The acting was perfect, granted some were better than others, but there was really no weak link, they all had their big moments in the film, and they all shined when the time came. This summer is a great summer for superheroes and I for one am extremely excited. First, it was kicked off by the sensational Avengers. Second, we have the new take on the Amazing Spider-Man. And third, we get the finale to my favorite superhero series of all time with the Dark Knight Rises. I simply can't stress it enough, GO SEE THE AVENGERS!!!

2012-05-04,"I've never been a comic book geek but have seen all the Marvel movies thus far (the sole exception being Iron Man 2) and have loved them all. Until now, Thor was my favorite, simply because I was a huge fan of the otherworldly cinematography, the Shakespearean dialogue and characters, and because I found Tom Hiddleston's Loki to be the most captivating villain in any superhero movie to date. So, perhaps just as much as seeing The Avengers come together, I was equally stoked to see Loki again as the arch-nemesis. Simply put, he was fantastic. There is a scene when he confronts Black Widow, about halfway through the film, that is nothing short of haunting and allows him to show his full range of talents. He's brilliant.As far as The Avengers themselves... Joss Whedon does two things very well here. First, he allows each character ample time to harness and exhibit its individual conflicts, and how they would play out among the team. After all, putting four superheroes in a room and asking them to play nicely should be no easy task, given the massive egos you would expect to be involved. Whedon plays this collective angst out very nicely. Second, he ties all the story lines from the individual movies together, in a near seamless fashion. Amazingly, everything made a good deal of sense as it came together, with no major storyline flaws. Quite the accomplishment, given the diversity of many of the stories told in each film.Robert Downey is great, capturing the cynicism and narcissism of Tony Stark better than he did in the original. Captain America and Thor bring unexpected humanity to their roles. Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was quite the surprise, as he does what Eric Bana and Edward Norton failed to do, and that is underplay Banner (rather than portray him as a neurotic, hyper fool). The best Hulk yet. Scarlett Johannsen does a very nice job as Black Widow, also conveying deep emotion and pain.Probably the best dynamic is between Stark and Banner... two intellectual geeks who form quite a bond that is believable.Lastly, I saw it in IMAX and that probably added an extra point to my 9/10 rating, as seeing it in a less profound format wouldn't quite capture everything that is on display here. All in all, definitely worth seeing and I'll be back in the theatre again before it's on DVD, which will certainly be in my collection.",9.0,2012-05,Friday,"10:0.04, about:0.03, after:0.04, again:0.09, all:0.13, also:0.04, america:0.03, an:0.03, and:0.25, any:0.04, as:0.26, avengers:0.05, back:0.05, banner:0.09, be:0.13, because:0.08, been:0.04, before:0.04, being:0.04, best:0.06, better:0.04, between:0.04, black:0.07, book:0.04, brilliant:0.06, bring:0.06, but:0.02, came:0.05, captain:0.03, certainly:0.06, character:0.03, characters:0.03, come:0.04, comic:0.04, definitely:0.05, dialogue:0.05, did:0.04, do:0.04, does:0.12, downey:0.04, each:0.07, everything:0.09, expect:0.05, fan:0.04, fantastic:0.05, far:0.10, favorite:0.05, film:0.05, first:0.03, found:0.06, four:0.06, from:0.03, full:0.06, given:0.11, good:0.03, great:0.03, have:0.05, he:0.22, here:0.09, hiddleston:0.05, him:0.09, his:0.03, how:0.04, huge:0.05, hulk:0.05, in:0.19, individual:0.12, iron:0.03, is:0.13, it:0.07, its:0.04, job:0.05, joss:0.04, just:0.03, less:0.06, lines:0.05, ll:0.05, loki:0.07, loved:0.06, made:0.04, man:0.03, many:0.04, mark:0.04, marvel:0.03, most:0.04, movie:0.02, movies:0.06, much:0.03, my:0.09, never:0.04, nice:0.06, no:0.07, norton:0.06, nothing:0.05, now:0.04, of:0.12, on:0.05, original:0.06, out:0.06, play:0.12, point:0.05, probably:0.11, put:0.05, quite:0.20, rather:0.06, rating:0.06, robert:0.04, ruffalo:0.04, saw:0.05, scarlett:0.04, scene:0.05, second:0.05, see:0.03, seeing:0.15, seen:0.04, sense:0.06, short:0.06, should:0.04, show:0.05, simply:0.12, so:0.03, stark:0.09, story:0.03, storyline:0.06, superhero:0.03, superheroes:0.04, team:0.04, than:0.07, that:0.10, the:0.37, their:0.03, them:0.07, there:0.03, they:0.03, things:0.05, this:0.02, thor:0.06, through:0.05, time:0.03, to:0.17, together:0.10, tom:0.05, tony:0.05, two:0.09, until:0.06, ve:0.04, very:0.10, villain:0.04, was:0.11, well:0.03, what:0.03, whedon:0.07, when:0.03, which:0.04, who:0.03, widow:0.08, will:0.03, with:0.02, worth:0.05, would:0.07, yet:0.05, you:0.02"

2012-05-05,"I'm not what you would consider an authority on the Avengers, but I did grow up reading all the Marvel comics I could get my hands on. I eagerly watched every movie, TV show & cartoon starring super heroes. I was a big fan of the old Incredible Hulk TV show starring Bill Bixby & Lou Ferrigno. I read Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, & Avengers Comics as well.I would suggest before seeing the Avengers, Seeing Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America & Thor. It's not prerequisite, but it would certainly enhance your enjoyment of the movie.Joss Whedon is one of my favorite directors/writers/producers (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Firefly, Serenity, Dollhouse & Cabin in the Woods). I love his sense of humor.At first I was disappointed that Edward Norton didn't return for the role of Bruce Banner, but Mark Ruffalo was Incredible as the Hulk! Samuel L. Jackson brings the bad ass to the role of Col. Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D.! Robert Downey Jr. brings his charisma to Iron Man again. Chris Evans (Captain America), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) all brought the magic in their roles!The story and action were amazing. Just the right balance of eye candy, character & comic relief. I plan to see it again in the theater & buy it on Blu-Ray.

2012-04-29,"I brag about movies being good all the time, but rarely when I believe they are great. I'm a fan of all genres of movies, but lately I have felt a bond to grow with superhero movies because they keep getting better, it seems Hollywood finally listened to regular, common people that pay to watch the movies they produce. It has been a while since I walked out of a movie theater with a sense of satisfaction, and today was no exception. I live in El Paso Texas, but today I crossed the border(legally of course), to Juarez to watch the avengers movie. I know I am still a little immature at my age(35), on some things of course, but sitting at the movie theater I felt like a kid again, happy, excited, and with a smile from cheek to cheek when it was over. I am a geek regarding comic books, superhero movies and stuff, heck, my favorite toy and item of collection is my wolverine #1 in near-mint condition, lol. But seriously, this is a movie to see more than once in movie theaters, specially in 3d, then purchase it on blu-ray when it comes out, because it will be one of those movies that you can watch over and over, I am very happy this movie was made, every other superhero movie that comes out after this has to be spectacular, near- perfect, because this movie just raised the bar for the genre, good job, and thanks to everyone involved in creating this awesome production.

2012-04-24,"I just saw the movie. I have been a comic reader and a movie goer for more than twenty years now, and a film like this should have been my wet dream. Instead what I saw was a hollow, empty attempt to recreate the magic of the original comic book: an attempt that poorly fails in a miserable way despite (or I should say: thanks to) all the special effects and the star power the producers have tried to throw in. The fantasy, the wit, the ideas that were present in the comic and that made it the dreams and the joy of so many kids, were completely absent in this studio behemoth. I will admit that the recreation of such magic was a difficult task, probably doomed from the beginning: but this thing is completely lacking brain, or direction, or any meaning at all. The script is a total and utter disaster, full of bore and incredibly shallow, and it goes just ridiculous every time it tries to go funny with sketches and jokes all very similar between themselves. I will rate the movie 2 stars just to give it credit for having been able to give us the first decent Banner/Hulk: it took only three attempts to the Hollywood writers - and god knows how many millions of dollars wasted. Movies like ""Avengers"" are unlucky children that inherit only all the defects from both the parents, which in this case would be Mr. Mainstream Comics and Mrs. Movie Industry. This leaves them with basically no audience: they are too much gruesome and boring for kids, too much childish for youngsters, while for the adults - at least for those the grown-up ones - there are just too many capes. The same stories, printed on comic pages, still resonate in popular culture after decades: but this movie will be hopefully forgotten as soon as the media battage slow down.",2.0,2012-04,Tuesday,"able:0.08, after:0.05, all:0.11, an:0.04, and:0.26, any:0.05, are:0.10, as:0.06, at:0.08, audience:0.07, avengers:0.03, banner:0.06, be:0.07, been:0.14, beginning:0.08, between:0.06, book:0.06, boring:0.08, both:0.07, but:0.06, comic:0.19, comics:0.07, down:0.07, effects:0.05, every:0.05, film:0.04, first:0.05, for:0.17, from:0.07, full:0.07, funny:0.06, give:0.12, go:0.05, god:0.07, goes:0.08, have:0.10, having:0.07, hollywood:0.08, how:0.05, hulk:0.04, in:0.15, instead:0.08, is:0.05, it:0.12, just:0.15, least:0.07, like:0.07, made:0.05, many:0.16, more:0.04, movie:0.13, movies:0.04, much:0.09, my:0.04, no:0.05, now:0.06, of:0.11, on:0.03, only:0.09, or:0.12, original:0.08, power:0.08, probably:0.07, same:0.06, saw:0.14, say:0.05, script:0.07, should:0.12, so:0.04, special:0.06, star:0.07, stars:0.08, still:0.06, such:0.06, than:0.04, that:0.13, the:0.51, them:0.04, there:0.04, they:0.04, thing:0.06, this:0.14, those:0.06, time:0.04, to:0.16, too:0.15, up:0.04, us:0.07, very:0.04, was:0.06, way:0.05, were:0.09, what:0.04, which:0.05, while:0.06, will:0.13, with:0.06, would:0.04, years:0.06"
2012-04-29,"MY TOTALLY ORIGINAL SUGGESTION, is they do a Dr. Strange movie, why not get the rights to that?

2012-05-04,"I came into the fanboyhood of Joss Whedon late in my life, realizing I was a fan of his productions unknowingly. I didn't put him and Avengers together until recently, but after that I was rather in anticipation of it since. Very much filmed with the same eye for sci-fi as Firefly, the continuity of the film had a warmth and familiarity to it that was easy to accept.First off, it is a fantastic start to the summer blockbuster movies. With films like Prometheus and Batteship also on the horizon I will be probably more critical of what is to come as opposed to what just set the bar. With a legion of special effects people and filmed for 3D, I believe I did an injustice seeing it in a theater that was doing 2D: Some of the shots just did not come out the way I think it would have if viewed behind the glasses (I saw it in 2D because I am not a huge fan of 3D and all the hype). Technically, it was directed and filmed for 3D, and doing a backward compatibility might not have been the best. However, I do believe that when released as a BluRay disk, most people would not be able to watch it. The production crew may need to tweak it a bit before then.Secondly, a master hand was at the helm shifting the weight of the film skillfully between CGI, Action, Drama and comic relief. Every artist has the right to interpret a story the way they see it. Based on characters the movie-going public have already been introduced to I'm sure helped, but for many, only Iron Man has had the most press. Hulk seems to have failed; Captain America did well at the box office but was oddly out of place; Thor wasn't as well received and his future as well wasn't a forgone conclusion. Natasha, Hawkeye, Nick Fury: If you didn't really read the comics you just wouldn't have guessed at their place in a movie with so many super-ego's in it. Somehow, Joss managed to extrapolate these vague characters and put them into a solid mix that did not always get along to at the gitgo.The story is strong with continuity and weaves a strong relationship between the superhero's without haste. With a strong beginning, the plot is revealed very early but then dwells not so much on the story but the intermixing of the characters to form what the comic book is about: The alliance of superheros as a team called The Avengers. Ever been in a band where all the musicians compete for the spotlight but end up just increasing the gain of their amps? It is not an easy lesson to learn but it was obvious that Iron Man was the primary focus. Meetings, indifference, competition and cooperation, very hard lessons to learn when the world as we know it is at stake but they manage to put aside their egos for the common good and the saving of Manhattan.Damn, why is it New York City is always the focus of monstrous plots? Guess I better not go there.Navigating the story, there were many points where homage was paid to movies that preceded it. Obvious was Independence day, Ghostbusters, Avatar and the likes. You had a mix of Asian, northern euro and American curltures which made for a multifaceted presentation. I had a few problems with future-world design, like the water/air ship which staged the initial disharmony of the superheros. I will also reiterate my comment about 2D and 3D screen presentation.Alan Sylvestri does a stunning soundtrack, which didn't have the usual signature of the initial measure pop as in preceding films. It was appropriate though a solid theme was lacking... or maybe I just could not get a theme figured out while viewing all the action.One of my biggest surprises was the re-write of Bruce Banner/Hulk. Totally unconventional, the taught character of the gamma-altered human was harsh, intellectual and sometimes more unemotional than his counterpart Hulk, who really stood out as a serious contender for a relaunch or maybe a new franchise if Jeremy Renner is open to it. The super-hero team accepted him and knew how to kindle the huge green giant's passion and formed an amazing bond with his peers. I would love to see a new Hulk movie with this reworked character.Joss has weaved together an amazing story with very few holes, and maybe I will see it again, but this time in 3D just to see if my observation of the 2D version is correct. Go see it. Great action, great compassion, great story.

2012-05-05,"Avengers movie review Oh my god I love this movie. I went with a friend who prefers to be not named. We both loved it. It was incredible, amazing, and awesome movie. This time I will say the plot first. Col. Nick Fury brings together Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye together to become the Avengers and fight Loki and his army of Chiturai. Robert Downey JR is Tony Stark. There is no one else that can play this role and if they get someone else he will pale in comparison. Chris Evans is so awesome as Captain America. Chris Hemsworth really nails the role as Thor. If anyone is worried about Mark Ruffalo not doing a good job as Banner. I almost feel he was better than Ed Norton. I like the Norton as Bruce too but Ruffalo really feels like Banner. He is incredible as Banner. The Hulk looks Incredible. He looks like Mark Ruffalo. You feel it. Scarlett Johansson does a great job as Black Widow. There is a scene where she speaks in a foreign language she does such a good job. She is not a perfect Black Widow but she does a good job of bringing her own take to the role. Jeremy Renner is Hawkeye. He was my fan pick. I feel like they listened to the fans when they casted him for the role. Tom Hiddleston is so sinister as Loki. He was great in the Thor movie but he is even better in this movie. Samuel L Jackson really nails the role as Nick Fury. He does such a commanding role. He knows how to take charge. Clark Greg as Agent Phil Coulson does a great job too. He knows how to take charge and he was such a fan boy around Captain America. Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill is so good. She is a great SHIELD agent. The Shield Hellcarrier is like right out of the comic book. WOW! The Quinn Jet is great too. Loki's Army is so amazing looking. Then you have the Levathion. It is not Fing Fang Foo the Dragon from the Iron Man comics. But it looks so incredible anyway. They call the cosmic cube a Tesseract. If you don't know what that means basically it can open up wormholes. The first time I heard that word is when I read the book Wrinkle in Time when I was a child so that is how I understand what it is. Everything you wanted is in this film and more. When I saw the Artist I thought no movie would beat it until now. I feel this movie has smashed my scale. I friend gave it 11/10 and so am I. So to quote Spinal tap. This dial goes to 11. For this movie it is 11/10. It is that great. This will be on Blip TV and Youtube soon.

After phase 1 we are treated to this incredible, inspired battle royale. The mischievous Loki (Hiddleston) with some mysterious influence attacks New York with a galactic army of Aliens. Good thing sassy Iron Man played by an amazing Robert Downey Jr., mega hunky with inspired comic timing Thor (Hemsworth), sexy Hawkeye (Renner), the fierce Hulk (Ruffalo) and gorgeous all American boy Captain America (Evans).

2012-08-22,First of all i would like to say that the avengers is marvel's best film to date and there are quite a few positives in the film.The direction and screenplay is nothing short of brilliant. Joss Whedon deserves a lot of credit. The film could have gone awfully wrong with so much heroes in one film but the director has successfully tightened up all loose ends. For a film in which so much characters are sharing one screen space you would expect a lot of things to go wrong but not in this one.The acting was nothing short of brilliant. All the characters were completely faithful to their roles but the standout was Mark Ruffalo as the hulk. He was nothing short of amazing. I won't be surprised if marvel makes a stand alone hulk film with him.The special effects were outstanding. I have never seen anything like it in any film before.Now to the negatives about the film. One of them is the soundtrack that doesn't quite live upto expectations.The other is the dialogue. As far as i can think there were no memorable dialogues at all. All were pretty mediocre.The main negative thing about the film was the lack of emotional depth which was in abundance in spiderman 2 and nolan's batman trilogy.Overall i would say it is a brilliant film but a little overrated. I don't think it should be more than 8 on IMDb. 8.6 is too much and very close to TDK and TDKR which were pure masterpieces. However it is marvel's best film upto date and certainly raises the bar for marvel at the movies.,8.0,2012-08,Wednesday,"about:0.08, acting:0.05, all:0.13, amazing:0.05, and:0.12, any:0.05, anything:0.06, are:0.06, as:0.09, at:0.07, avengers:0.03, batman:0.07, be:0.06, before:0.05, best:0.08, brilliant:0.21, but:0.10, can:0.04, certainly:0.08, characters:0.07, could:0.05, depth:0.08, dialogue:0.07, director:0.06, doesn:0.06, don:0.04, effects:0.04, expect:0.07, expectations:0.07, far:0.06, few:0.06, film:0.36, first:0.04, for:0.05, go:0.05, has:0.04, have:0.06, he:0.04, heroes:0.04, him:0.05, however:0.06, hulk:0.07, if:0.04, imdb:0.08, in:0.16, is:0.15, it:0.09, joss:0.04, like:0.07, little:0.06, lot:0.10, main:0.06, makes:0.05, mark:0.05, marvel:0.14, more:0.04, movies:0.04, much:0.12, never:0.05, no:0.04, not:0.03, nothing:0.18, now:0.05, of:0.17, on:0.03, one:0.12, other:0.04, overall:0.06, pretty:0.06, quite:0.12, ruffalo:0.05, say:0.10, screen:0.05, seen:0.05, short:0.22, should:0.05, so:0.07, special:0.05, stand:0.08, than:0.04, that:0.05, the:0.39, their:0.04, them:0.04, there:0.07, thing:0.06, things:0.06, think:0.10, this:0.02, to:0.13, too:0.05, up:0.04, very:0.04, was:0.14, were:0.20, whedon:0.04, which:0.13, with:0.05, won:0.08, would:0.12, wrong:0.15, you:0.03"
2013-08-06,"The Avengers is one of the best films I have ever seen. It is action packed, thrilling and full of amazing special effects! The characters are developed throughout the movie as they learn to work as a team. The story line is excellent and the movie has you on the edge of your see throughout. I saw this is in 3D and 2D and I have to say; it is incredible in 2D, but unimaginable in 3D. I also liked the development of some of the less well known characters and links made to other Marvel Movies. There is also a great deal of humour to add another depth to this immense movie.

2012-04-28,"I'm usually very excited to watch a superhero movie, but after hitting a couple of really bad ones I kind of lost my faith for an amazing one. I thought of skipping this movie (figured it was overkill to have so many heroes in one film), but good reviews and the fact that it had Joss Whedon's prints all over it tempted me to go see it anyway. And I was not disappointed. In fact, I was amazed!The threat to earth is genuine and the action spectacular. But what really makes this movie stand out for me is the fact that it combines serious action with sharp humor seemingly without effort. And it is endearing to see very human flaws in the heroes you've come to love. I felt it was a well-paced movie, where every hero got to shine in their own way. Annnnnd I think Coby Smulders should definitely feature more in movies like this one: honey, that outfit was...ehm well tailored. ;)If you haven't seen this one yet: run (don't walk damnit) to the nearest theatre for an amazingly entertaining 2,5h ride, that'll still leave you yearning for more!",9.0,2012-04,Saturday,"action:0.09, after:0.08, all:0.04, amazing:0.08, an:0.11, and:0.12, bad:0.08, but:0.12, come:0.08, definitely:0.10, disappointed:0.11, don:0.07, earth:0.09, entertaining:0.09, every:0.08, fact:0.31, felt:0.10, film:0.05, for:0.16, go:0.07, good:0.05, got:0.09, had:0.06, have:0.05, haven:0.11, hero:0.08, heroes:0.14, humor:0.09, if:0.06, in:0.18, is:0.10, it:0.23, joss:0.07, kind:0.11, like:0.05, ll:0.10, love:0.09, makes:0.08, many:0.07, me:0.12, more:0.11, movie:0.15, movies:0.05, my:0.06, not:0.04, of:0.10, one:0.18, out:0.06, over:0.08, own:0.09, really:0.12, reviews:0.11, see:0.11, seen:0.07, serious:0.12, should:0.08, so:0.05, spectacular:0.12, stand:0.12, still:0.08, superhero:0.06, that:0.15, the:0.18, their:0.06, think:0.07, this:0.14, thought:0.09, to:0.26, ve:0.08, very:0.13, was:0.21, watch:0.06, way:0.07, well:0.11, what:0.06, whedon:0.07, where:0.08, with:0.04, without:0.09, yet:0.10, you:0.14"

2023-07-17,"The movie was interesting , fun and entertaining. I like how subjective and opinionated it was. The drama and the exaggerated emotional story behind the superheroes was great (I like how they expressed the directors imagination ,creativity, subjective thoughts and beliefs). It is a great movie to watch if you literally want to escape from reality and just sit down enjoy and stay entertained. I think the fighting and the planning to how they are going to win the battles are well balanced and good . But the emotional stories and emotional background behind each hero (including the heroes in the justice league) was the extra part (it was highly dramatic and obviously subjective but that is what makes the movie deserve a well round of applause) but it does not change the fun you experience while you are watching the whole movie whether that part was included or not included in the movie.The female characters, though looked terribly disgusting, needed more help than the male characters; to be honest (same goes for the justice league as well).",10.0,2023-07,Monday,"and:0.30, are:0.14, as:0.04, be:0.05, but:0.12, characters:0.10, does:0.07, down:0.09, each:0.07, enjoy:0.09, entertaining:0.09, experience:0.11, fighting:0.10, for:0.04, from:0.05, fun:0.15, goes:0.11, going:0.08, good:0.05, great:0.11, help:0.11, hero:0.08, heroes:0.07, highly:0.11, how:0.20, if:0.06, in:0.07, interesting:0.10, is:0.07, it:0.13, just:0.05, like:0.10, makes:0.08, more:0.06, movie:0.18, not:0.09, of:0.03, or:0.06, part:0.18, same:0.09, story:0.06, superheroes:0.07, than:0.06, that:0.07, the:0.56, they:0.10, think:0.07, though:0.09, to:0.16, want:0.09, was:0.24, watch:0.06, watching:0.08, well:0.17, what:0.06, while:0.09, whole:0.09, you:0.14"

2012-05-04,"I'm very satisfied with the outcome of this theatrical event. The movie has actually succeeded my expectations. Okay, maybe not succeeded, but it definitely fulfilled them. I'm sure anyone would agree that this was, by far the best of the Marvel series. There were many laughs which is one of the fine parts of the movie. Tony Stark played by returning Robert Downey Jr. had most of the witty lines, but he wasn't the only one to bring laughs. Another fine point of the movie was the action. This movie had non stop action. Don't get me wrong, this wasn't just a blow up everything movie, it all had reason. It had well choreographed fight scenes like the one involving Black Widow playing by the lovely Scarlett Johansson and many others involving the Avengers. Loki, Tom Hiddleston, was the best villain one could ask for. He was menacing enough to take seriously, but yet he still managed to be likable. The first scene when he comes in is just amazing. Tom Hiddleston obviously just loves show stealing because he's do it again. And HULK, let's talk about him. If there's someone who stood out in this movie, its definitely Bruce Banner, played by the first time hulk, Mark Ruffalo. He was, I'm sorry but, INCREDIBLE. There are some scenes where you just can't help but to cheer for him. He is the best Hulk ever. Come on Marvel, before you give Cap and Thor another movie, why not give him one? He had the best scenes in the movie. Mark's acting as Bruce was just as good as Hulk's CGI. I could talk about Hulk forever, but moving on, I like the character development. I felt like the movie went at the right pace to bring everyone in and it was well timed. Joss Whedon should be proud.Also, besides the Hulk movie, I also think they should do some kind of Halkeye/Black Widow movie. They need their own movie to have their whole story told and also they're cute together. Plus, if you have yet to see this in theaters, when you go, don't forget to stay for the two extra scenes, during and after the credits. ~If you actually read through that, thank you.

2012-09-06,"IronMan, Captain America, The Hulk, Thor, Eagle Eye and the Black Widow unite under the SHIELD banner to face a colossal threat led by fallen god Loki.I come at this both late - the film is already one of the most financially successful films ever made as I write these lines - and relatively indifferent to the whole Avengers mythos. I am also unfamiliar with said mythos. Superman and Batman are well established in Europe, but many of Marvel's properties are much less so. With that in mind, the folks at Marvel deserve an award for long-term strategic planning.Under almost any shape, an Avengers film would have made a deal of money. So it is to the credit of the powers behind this behemoth that time was taken to establish each of the heroes individually before embarking on this group adventure. The choice of Iron Man as a starting point, particularly with the genius casting of Robert Downey Junior, proved especially savvy. Iron Man has many similarities to Batman, but where the latter, now the heart of a hugely successful rival film franchise, is at heart quite dark and brooding, Iron Man is inherently light- hearted and fun, something the first film outing captured brilliantly.Assembling the Avengers was not always a smooth process. The SHIELD line felt a bit shoehorned into the Hulk's reboot, derailed the plot or Iron Man's sequel, and frustratingly cut short Captain America's period solo potential. And now that they were finally together, supported by fresh film back-stories of varying quality for the uninitiated, you'd think the studio would sit back and enjoy an easy success.Thankfully, you'd be wrong.From the first few seconds up to the ending, the film oozes with love for its characters, giving most of them not only defining moments but also the fine small details that make you care. Downey Junior could have easily walked away with the honors regardless of the overall film's qualities. That the filmmakers try their best to create a sense of balance shows both respect and confidence in their other characters, and a strong determination to make this work as a team vehicle. The often square Captain America is thankfully done justice, and after two different attempts, the Hulk is finally spot on, Mark Ruffalo giving the film most of its heart and pathos.Until the Avengers, the world was gearing up for the Dark Knight's grand finale. A trilogy that took a mildly ridiculous premise and turned it into a dark, gritty and grand opera. And for all their admirable qualities, Nolan's masterpiece and its two companion pieces sometimes felt a tad grim. The Avengers strikes a perfect balance between serious stakes and its inherent ridiculousness. Here Joss Whedon - of whom I was no fan coming into this - proves himself ideally suited to the task. His trademark wit is perfectly attuned to the material.The biggest Summer blockbuster of 2012 is a finely crafted, rousing adventure, sparkled with humor and character, a love of its protagonists, and above all fun.Thank you Marvel and everyone involved for creating such high expectations, and then exceeding them.",8.0,2012-09,Thursday,"2012:0.05, after:0.04, all:0.04, almost:0.05, already:0.05, also:0.06, always:0.04, am:0.04, america:0.08, an:0.07, and:0.30, any:0.03, are:0.04, as:0.06, at:0.08, avengers:0.10, away:0.05, back:0.08, banner:0.04, batman:0.10, be:0.02, before:0.04, best:0.03, between:0.04, biggest:0.05, bit:0.04, black:0.03, blockbuster:0.05, both:0.09, but:0.06, by:0.05, captain:0.08, care:0.05, character:0.03, characters:0.05, come:0.04, coming:0.05, could:0.03, dark:0.13, different:0.04, done:0.04, downey:0.07, each:0.03, enjoy:0.04, especially:0.04, ever:0.03, everyone:0.04, expectations:0.05, face:0.06, fan:0.04, felt:0.09, few:0.04, film:0.19, films:0.03, finally:0.09, first:0.06, for:0.11, franchise:0.05, from:0.02, fun:0.07, giving:0.11, god:0.05, group:0.05, has:0.03, have:0.04, here:0.04, heroes:0.03, high:0.04, his:0.03, hulk:0.07, humor:0.04, in:0.05, into:0.10, iron:0.10, is:0.13, it:0.03, its:0.16, joss:0.03, knight:0.05, less:0.05, line:0.05, lines:0.05, loki:0.03, long:0.04, love:0.08, made:0.06, make:0.07, man:0.10, many:0.07, mark:0.03, marvel:0.08, mind:0.05, moments:0.04, money:0.05, most:0.09, much:0.03, no:0.03, not:0.04, now:0.07, of:0.24, on:0.05, one:0.02, only:0.03, or:0.03, other:0.03, overall:0.04, perfect:0.04, perfectly:0.05, plot:0.03, point:0.05, powers:0.05, quite:0.04, robert:0.03, ruffalo:0.03, said:0.05, sense:0.05, sequel:0.05, serious:0.05, short:0.05, so:0.05, something:0.04, such:0.04, summer:0.05, team:0.04, that:0.11, the:0.53, their:0.08, them:0.06, then:0.04, these:0.03, they:0.02, think:0.03, this:0.08, thor:0.03, time:0.03, to:0.15, together:0.03, two:0.08, until:0.05, up:0.05, was:0.08, well:0.03, were:0.03, whedon:0.03, where:0.04, whole:0.04, widow:0.03, with:0.11, work:0.04, world:0.04, would:0.06, wrong:0.05, you:0.09"

2012-09-24,"I love Joss Whedon. I love some comic book movies (X-Men, Daredevil, Batman). I like quite a few of the actors in this.So why on earth did I hate it so much?For me the style was probably the worst thing. Some movies grab me, and make me watch. This didn't from the outset. It felt like a high budget TV episode. The look felt stark and unrealistic (or actually, too realistic probably). It seems to have been filmed for 3D, because even in 2D you you just get lots of weird camera angles and a strange tone to it.The story... well, I just found it hard to pay attention for even the most shortest of times. It just was people doing stuff, but no sense of direction, or story, or building menace. In fact the menace looked like a Stargate TV series villain. Or something from a kids' movie.And the thing is with Stargate, I love the characters. But I don't with this film. They give me no reason to love them. So their actions are thus uninteresting.It doesn't surprise me, seeing afterwards, that Joss Whedon directed it. And it shows - he's a good writer, but doesn't have a lot of directing experience.Having said that, what do I know... look at the numbers it's made!But for me, I couldn't even watch it all the way through.

2012-05-06,"Loki has come to Earth and stolen an ancient artifact that will give him unlimited power. S.H.I.E.L.D. gathers a group of superheroes, which they call the Avengers, to defeat the evil. Okay, the villains and their goals are kind of lame (disappointing because Loki was a great villain in Thor - although, I must say, Tom Hiddleton is still very good in the role), but the focus of this film is mostly the superheroes. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye - with all of these guys, this movie should be a total mess. But the screenwriters (Joss Whedon & Zak Penn) have handled it beautifully, meting out dozens of great moments for all of them, not letting any one of them take over (although the Hulk almost does just because he's so awesome - funny, as he's never had a successful solo movie) nor fall behind, and never seeming too hard like it's trying to do that. There are times when the film is too thick with exposition, but the characters and the actors are all so good that it rarely drags (there's one long sequence where a bunch of characters are fighting amongst themselves that I thought felt a tad forced). The heroes' personalities and histories are utilized in impressive ways - I especially love the way they use Captain America's datedness (one particularly hilarious gag - and Whedon does a great job with the comic moments - has Captain America feeling overjoyed at finally getting a reference when someone refers to The Wizard of Oz).

This is overrated beyond all ends. The villain is annoying beyond all ends. Because you have to incorporate so many characters you have to cram all this crap into one movie and personally the individual films are much better. This felt like an overdose of flashy sh*t everywhere and the story is rather dull. I went in this movie with high hopes because I on occasion enjoy super hero movies. My favorites have to be the Tim Burton & Christopher Nolan Batman films. Those were fantastic. This is a mess. With over two hours of flashy ridiculous plot twists and cgi up the a** only Super Hero, Comic Book, Addicts and little kids will really appreciate this. If you have a brain and want more realism in a film avoid this crap aside. I gave it a 5 because some of the special effects were impressive and some of the action was cool and lets be real Scarlett Johanson is hot as hell. But this movie barely qualifies as a 5.

What Joss Whedon does a phenomenal job of is the portrayal of most of the heroes' humanity. The constant reminder that, ""they're just like us""; people REALLY enjoy that in a super hero movie. Though many Hollywood movies rely on special effects and CGI, their marketing ""tactics"" are certainly well grounded. People want to sit down with their friends/family/etc., watch a movie, and walk out feeling energized after a stressful day at work or school. Not that thought-provoking movies are ""too much"" for audiences, but sometimes ""reality"" isn't what people want to pay to see.

2012-05-02,"After reading mixed reviews about this film, I decided to give it a try, with both Digital 3D and D-Box as add-ons. Let me say that I was certainly not disappointed! Though the storyline in itself does not bring anything new to the game, I have to say that I have not been this entertained by a movie for a long time. Firstly, the CGI was best in class. The characters, including The Hulk were lifelike and believable. I remember thinking before the movie started ""Let's see what a $200 million movie looks like"" and the results are more than impressive.In regards to the 3D, YES there are some darks scenes where there is no real sense of depth, HOWEVER the final scene in NYC alone is worth paying the 3D premium for. Flying through the Manhattan skyline, dodging explosions and twist-and-turning in wrecked cars were some of many scenes that make you feel like you are actually there. This must have been helped by the D-Box chairs, which I would also recommend to make this experience complete.Finally, the actors all did a great job both in hilarious one-liners as well more emotional sequences.

2013-04-07,"If you like your typical action packed superhero movie, The Avengers is the perfect movie. It has action, suspense, and humor with a touch of romance thrown in. It has amazing heroes, a great villain, fighting scenes, a rivalry between hero and villain, and an all-star cast. What it lacks, is originality. All superhero movies are the same, the world has been threatened in some way and a superhero must rise to the occasion to overcome the threat. The ongoing battle between good and evil, which isn't any different in this movie. What makes The Avengers different from other superhero movies is the compilation of characters. The world has been threatened once again and we need Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), to come together and save us, as Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) plans to use a glowing cube called the Tesseract to open a portal bringing an evil alien army to Earth to help takeover. We have beat Loki before in the movie Thor, now he is back with a vengeance. Unfortunately if you have not seen these movies you will need to catch up as there is not a lot of back story on why these heroes were chosen. With everything going on you do not really get to understand the characters, especially why Loki wants to control the world. Even if you haven't seen them you know what to expect and can understand the basic storyline. There are no surprises, you can plot out the movie before you even watch it. Overall, I found the movie to be exiting, but explored way too many times. The whole idea of needing a superhero to come save us has been done before. Originality is what makes a movie great. Director Joss Whedon did a great job compiling different characters together into one movie. Even with amazing special effects and compelling characters, I believe he could have made a better storyline with more surprises. We should be walking away thinking, ""Wow, I did not expect that to happen!"" The world will continue to want heroes in their lives. In movies like The Avengers, we are given hope that good will always overcome evil. Which is why I'm sure they will be coming out with another one soon.

2012-05-04,"This was my favorite one out of all of them so far out of all the marvel movies. I've seen it twice already (Midnight showing then the first one in the morning) And both time's i jumped, laughed, and had a fantastic time watching it. I have a few tips before you check it out Tip one is is wait for after all the credits, there will be less then a minute of them then something then there will be like 5 minutes of them then something again.

2012-11-18,"""Marvels The Avengers"" sounded like a movie that I would just not be in to because of the fact that it has to do with a bunch of superheroes but all in to one movie. To be honest, that is just not my kind of movie. Once it was announced in our class that we would be watching it I was not excited at all, all I thought was that I was really going to be bored and just want to sleep the whole time, but that was not the case. The movie really was intriguing and really snatched your attention right up.The fact that Joss Whedon was able to put all of the superhero movies that everybody knows and loves all in to one movie and make it all fall into place without changing any of the characters in anyways was really a great thing. The movie also was just not an ordinary action filled movie with the same old action that all those types of movies carry; it had so much more and was so much more advanced in every single way. The graphics, the special effects, the fighting scenes, and every little detail was so precise and on target. Nothing ever let me down in this movie that I thought should change or be different. All in all now when it comes down to this type of movie I know I will not judge it just because of the fact that it is an action filled movie that comes from comic books because who knows, it could be really good just like ""The Avengers"" was.The only bad review that I would give the movie is that in the beginning it was a little hard to follow. Especially if you are person watching it for the first time and don't really follow all of the other movies that are put in to it. My only advice would be in the beginning to show who the characters are and what they were all about so some of the viewers watching the movie for the first time can follow a little easier and not have to take the time to figure out what exactly is happening and who the people are that are playing the characters like Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, and etc. At first in the movie I didn't know what actor was playing the Hulk so that really confused me.

2012-05-16,"This movie is in my opinion one of the best ever made. There were doubts that Marvel Studios could pulls this movie together, the sheer scope was mind-boggling. With 3 actors ( and 4 characters) who each carried their own movies it didn't seem likely, but the ensemble cast was amazing and each character is given their due focus. The story is excellent, the villain is likable and suitably evil, and the action and special effects are top notch.

2013-06-01,"The Avengers has gotten a lot of praise, much of which it rightly deserves, but the plot is somewhat uninspired. It's your classic comic- book movie formula with an evil villain who wants to take over the Earth and a team of superheroes is the only thing that stands in his way. But that isn't really what the film is about anyway. The presence of the evil villain merely serves as a means to an end; in this case the end being the assembly of the Avengers, an event the previous films have all been leaving up to. And while the plot is predictable and could have been a lot more innovative, the way the characters are brought together is handled masterfully.This brings me to the actors, and the cast in the Avengers is superb. Uniting the cast of all the independent previous films, with the exception of Edward Norton who was sadly unable to reprise his role from the Incredible Hulk (2008), the Avengers consists of an all star cast whose performances are definitely largely the reason why this film is so good.The main reason, however, for the Avengers being the success that it is is the director. Joss Whedon was the perfect choice for this film for one reason above all others; he has the talent to create a fantastic on- screen chemistry between characters with very different lifestyles. While seeing Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Captain America (Chris Evans) having an argument is a terrific crossover moment on its own, Whedon's sense for chemistry really makes scenes such as this stand out where others might fail to do so.Combining this with fast paced, intense action scenes with amazing special effects makes for a visual thrill ride, however Whedon also never forgets what the film is really about; these superheroes from across space and time coming together to fight a common enemy.The result: a well balanced, well paced blockbuster that also has a lot of heart. And for me this more than makes up for the superficial plot, especially considering the amount of work, time and money Marvel has invested in these films, making sure everything ties in and adds up, all leading up to this.When it first came out, a lot of people were afraid that the Avengers could not live up to the expectations raised by the other films. In my opinion, not only does it live up to the expectations, it exceeds them.You won't be disappointed by this film, however I strongly recommend you watch the other films first to really be able to appreciate the masterpiece that the entire series is.",9.0,2013-06,Saturday,"able:0.05, about:0.06, action:0.02, actors:0.04, all:0.09, also:0.06, amazing:0.04, america:0.03, amount:0.05, an:0.12, and:0.13, are:0.04, as:0.04, avengers:0.12, be:0.04, been:0.06, being:0.07, between:0.04, blockbuster:0.05, book:0.04, brings:0.05, brought:0.05, but:0.04, by:0.05, came:0.05, captain:0.03, cast:0.11, characters:0.05, chris:0.04, comic:0.03, coming:0.05, could:0.07, definitely:0.04, different:0.04, director:0.04, disappointed:0.05, do:0.03, does:0.03, downey:0.03, earth:0.04, effects:0.03, end:0.07, entire:0.05, especially:0.04, evans:0.04, everything:0.04, evil:0.09, expectations:0.09, fantastic:0.04, fight:0.04, film:0.11, films:0.16, first:0.06, for:0.13, from:0.05, good:0.02, has:0.10, have:0.04, having:0.05, he:0.03, his:0.06, however:0.13, hulk:0.02, in:0.10, incredible:0.04, iron:0.02, is:0.18, isn:0.05, it:0.09, its:0.03, joss:0.03, jr:0.03, lot:0.14, main:0.04, makes:0.11, making:0.04, man:0.02, marvel:0.03, me:0.06, might:0.05, moment:0.05, money:0.05, more:0.05, movie:0.02, much:0.03, my:0.03, never:0.04, norton:0.05, not:0.04, of:0.16, on:0.04, one:0.02, only:0.06, opinion:0.05, other:0.06, others:0.09, out:0.05, over:0.03, own:0.04, people:0.04, perfect:0.04, performances:0.05, plot:0.10, previous:0.09, really:0.11, reason:0.15, recommend:0.05, robert:0.03, role:0.05, scenes:0.06, screen:0.03, seeing:0.04, sense:0.05, series:0.05, so:0.05, special:0.04, stand:0.05, star:0.05, such:0.04, superheroes:0.07, sure:0.04, take:0.04, team:0.03, than:0.03, that:0.10, the:0.55, them:0.03, these:0.07, thing:0.04, this:0.14, time:0.05, to:0.19, together:0.06, up:0.16, very:0.03, villain:0.08, visual:0.05, wants:0.06, was:0.04, watch:0.03, way:0.06, well:0.05, were:0.03, what:0.05, whedon:0.09, when:0.03, where:0.04, which:0.03, while:0.08, who:0.06, why:0.04, with:0.09, won:0.05, work:0.04, you:0.04, your:0.04"
2012-07-29,"From the beginning off this movie turned one completely off. The choice of a bad guy was horrible, a pure hype machine of a movie. Robert Downey is a good actor but his trite portrayal of being charming grows tiresome. Marvel movies have alway's lacked depth and true heart. However this movie engages than cruises by fast, a popcorn movie full of great marketing. A movie like this deserves one view, but really easy to forget its poorly written, acted due to all the hype. Its time for Robert to hang the the suit up. The first Iron Man was the only good one, the character is now dull and annoying. Liam as Thor has no on-screen like ability or charisma. Chris Evans plays a somewhat convincing role but he couldn't act his way through Fast And Furious. Mark Ruffalo is the only saving grace of this movie The Hulk will always be a hard hero to get right, he makes it work on all levels.

2012-11-19,"From the opening scene to the final seconds, Marvel's ""The Avengers"" is an action packed thrill ride that'll leave you begging for more. The overall storyline is nothing special, bad guy wants to rule the world using and alien army, but the true genius of Avengers lies in its execution. Joss Whedon moves the movie along at a pace that leaves the audience without a feeling of being rushed. The threat is quickly established, but a majority of the time is spent assembling the team. Though at first one is quick to point out that this tactic would lengthen the movie and draw things out in a bore, it is another credit to the directing/writing of Whedon. By slowly introducing each character we are better able to see each hero's personality bounce of the others in a sort of entertaining experiment that takes place right before our eyes.A good super hero movie often hinges on its villain (""The Dark Knight's"" Joker), and it isn't an easy task to make the audience doubt the heroes' ability to come out on top. Especially when there are six of them, but Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston, acts the part to perfection. And speaking of acting, it would appear that the third time is in fact the charm as no one could have predicted the show stealing performance by Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk who succeeded where Eric Bana and Edward Norton could not. His role as the cool, calculating scientist with a touch of emotional instability, ""I'm always angry,"" was highly engaging. As for the rest of the cast, they benefited from the group dynamic. Each hero was the star of his own movie and when they come together their respective egos clash resulting in action such as the fight between Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man and Chris Hemsworth's Thor, or hilarity in the case of Iron Man calling Captain America, played by Chris Evans, ""Old Man.""Amongst all the stars of the movie, there is still one more, the special effects. Delivering one the best action movies of the year could not be possible without serious CGI and Avengers delivers in outstanding fashion. From the ascension of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s mother ship to the moment the alien army's arrival in New York, the art department shows it has what it takes to compete with the likes of Michael Bay and Christopher Nolan. The Hulk is brought to life in astounding realism as well as the character many forget isn't real either, Iron Man.As a whole there is little that can be said against Whedon's new masterpiece. The expectations of every comic book fan and superhero movie buff must have hung heavy on his shoulders. The buildup to this was unlike anything ever seen in Hollywood.

2012-08-25,"I never thought going into the cinema that the previous Marvel films would amount to so much. They are nothing in comparison to this masterpiece. The films leading up to this being Captain America, Thor, The Incredible Hulk and the Iron Man films. These films range from average to decent, decent being Iron Man 1 which is the best out of the prequels. This film works in so many ways! It's hard to know where to begin with the review. The acting is good, the story line isn't complex but not too simple either. Each character is given a good amount of screen time and no character is left under-powered or look insignificant. The effects are very good maybe some of the best ever so far in film making. Josh Whedon has done himself proud! I loved Firefly and now I love this!Overall a very very VERY good film.

2012-05-06,"I'm not going to try to win everyone over by giving my review a cheesy over-done headline. I'm not also going to try to persuade you by comparing this movie to Christopher Nolan's Batman movies. I am a fan of both DC and Marvel Comics. when people do so, it drives me nuts. So I'm not going to give a review bashing the other like a lot of ""fans"" on here. so that being said; The Avengers is a great movie. All the movies that lead up to this film made this one a fantastic start to what could be an even better new saga. From the get-go, this movie starts out with what the rest of it will bring. I for one think sometimes 2 1/2 hours for a movie is a little drawn out, and very few times i have sat through a movie that long and felt I was short changed. It is very entertaining, very funny, and full of action. Joss Whedon truly lifted these characters from the pages of the comic into real life. Go see the movie, I saw it in 3-D IMAX, but to be honest any form of this movie is going to be just as great. If you enjoyed the last (actual) Marvel movies that lead us to this point, you definitely wont be disappointed.Stay for at least the first after credit footage, If you're an Avenger comic fan like I am, you will grin from ear to ear.",10.0,2012-05,Sunday,"action:0.04, after:0.06, all:0.03, also:0.05, am:0.14, an:0.08, and:0.10, any:0.06, as:0.03, at:0.04, avenger:0.08, avengers:0.03, batman:0.09, be:0.15, being:0.06, better:0.06, both:0.08, bring:0.09, but:0.03, by:0.09, characters:0.04, comic:0.11, comics:0.07, could:0.06, definitely:0.08, disappointed:0.09, do:0.06, done:0.07, enjoyed:0.08, entertaining:0.07, even:0.05, everyone:0.07, fan:0.13, fans:0.07, fantastic:0.08, felt:0.08, few:0.07, film:0.04, first:0.05, for:0.09, from:0.12, full:0.08, funny:0.07, get:0.05, give:0.07, giving:0.09, go:0.12, going:0.26, great:0.09, have:0.04, here:0.07, hours:0.09, if:0.09, in:0.03, into:0.06, is:0.11, it:0.11, joss:0.05, just:0.04, last:0.07, least:0.08, life:0.08, like:0.08, little:0.07, long:0.07, lot:0.06, made:0.05, marvel:0.09, me:0.05, movie:0.20, movies:0.13, my:0.04, new:0.07, not:0.11, of:0.15, on:0.04, one:0.07, other:0.05, out:0.09, over:0.12, people:0.06, point:0.08, re:0.08, real:0.08, rest:0.08, review:0.16, said:0.08, saw:0.08, see:0.05, short:0.09, so:0.12, start:0.08, that:0.12, the:0.24, these:0.06, think:0.06, this:0.16, through:0.07, times:0.07, to:0.31, truly:0.09, up:0.05, us:0.08, very:0.15, was:0.03, what:0.09, whedon:0.05, when:0.05, will:0.09, with:0.03, you:0.18"
2012-05-19,"Guess I'll come out and say it right away: The Avengers may be the best superhero movie made to date. It has plenty of action, an understandable plot, multiple and discernible heroes, plenty of laughs, and terrific effects. Now, I'll admit it: everyone else seems to be saying the same thing. So do I need to maintain my integrity as an amateur reviewer- person by going against the grain and finding fault with the movie? Or can I feel secure in my own opinion, even if it's shared by fanboys and nonfans alike? (Hint: it's the latter.) Who are The Avengers, anyway? Well, there's Captain America (Steve Rogers), who's actually from the 1940s but was frozen for about seventy years. There's Iron Man (Tony Stark), a man in a weaponized metal suit. There's The Hulk (Bruce Banner), who smashes. There's Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff), a superspy with some powers of her own. There's Hawkeye (Clint Barton), a master archer. And then there's Thor, a Norse god. We've been introduced to most of them already through their own films, so they seem like old pals to us. Helps cut down on backstory issues, anyway.It seems that Loki, the half-brother of Thor, has decided to open up a portal from his side of the universe to Earth itself, thus allowing a rampaging army of aliens to come in and slaughter us wholesale. Colonel Nick Fury, who's been recruiting our heroes to fight as a team, calls everyone in from wherever they were. They don't know each other, except by reputation. Can they stop bickering long enough to save the universe? It is possible.I mentioned before that our heroes are, well, discernible. This is no small feat, considering how many there are in the movie. Tony Stark is a narcissist. Steve Rogers is an anachronism. Bruce Banner has anger- management issues. Natasha is manipulative; Barton is manipulated. They're simultaneously human and superhuman.After assembling his team, Fury gives them the skinny. Banner's job is to find the Tesserac's location, an artifact that can produce immense power – or be wielded as an immense weapon. Supposedly, the Tesserac is high in gamma radiation, something Dr. Banner knows a little bit about. Meanwhile, the others are tasked with finding Loki, who's quite the badass. All of this is directed by Fury from a flying fortress that also can float. Kind of neat.Without the burden of needing backstories for everyone, writer/director Joss Whedon is free to throw thrills at us. The fight scenes are plausible and, at times, not at all cartoonish. This means that younger kids (it's a PG-13 movie) might find it a little intense. But there's very little blood, and what's seen is more like scratches on a face, or something. At any rate, although it's an unapologetically violent movie, it's carefully done; the amazing set pieces don't get in the way of a compelling story fraught with plenty of angst and anguish. This is how Transformers should have been.Boy, is there conflict. It's not as if the superheroes all show up mentally on board with Fury's plan. Not only are some of them mad at him, they snipe a little at each other. Sometimes this is the work of the masterful Loki; sometimes it's the natural difficult of strangers needing to form a cohesive unit.The acting is superb. Nick Fury is a role for which the estimable Samuel L. Jackson was born to play (and which he's played as a cameo in several movies already). Scarlett Johanssen picks up where she left off as Black Widow in Iron Man, and Robert Downey Jr., to no one's surprise, is effortlessly suave and jerkish as Stark. Chris Evans, as the idealistic Captain, and Chris Hemsworth, as the mighty but humbled Thor, are both terrific as well. Mark Ruffalo makes for a quietly intense Banner (and portrayed The Hulk via special effects). Jeremy Renner, seen very briefly in the Thor movie, is Hawkeye, a character with which most of us had had no prior exposure; Renner, however, gives his character so much depth that we're involved in his side story even more than we are with the others.So why wouldn't you watch this movie? It does have a lot of action, so if you hate that you should skip it. It's over two hours long, so if you don't like to sit, you should also skip it. It has strong female characters, hissable villains, heroes of all sizes, complicated love stories that sit in the background, and the fate of all mankind resting in the balance.

2012-06-23,"It is just amazing how this man (Mr. Whedon) turns anything into gold. Although there were some restrains and limits (given characters and all) to this story, Mr. Whedon and all (literally everybody) involved in production of this movie gave their best and made it one of the best American movies in many years. It is, however, a tough job to keep everything in balance (""superheroes"" and other childish and trivial stuff, producers' requests...) but despite of it Mr. Whedon did it again and exceeded by far all my expectations. I must note that he is at his best when his hands are not tied (Firefly & Serenity or Hush from Buffy, for example) and he's given full creative freedom but this movie is really something else. I've watched all the movies with separate characters involved (Thor, Captain America, Hulk and so on) and they were surprisingly good (although main characters only here gave their best). But this... Amazing! So witty, so fun, so close to reality (""making sense"") as it can possibly be, so full of those details that make your eyes sparkle and your brain filling with serotonin. Mr. Whedon knows how to pull out the best from anybody he's working with. Such a rare and precious gift and so NOT Hollywood.

2012-05-06,"I first have to say I saw the film in 2D (none of this 3D nonsense for me) and even so I did find some of the scenes very dark. Also, the aspect ratio at 1.78:1 seemed totally wrong to me, most films these days are shot in a ratio of 2.35:1 and I can't see why this one had to be different (it may be a 3D thing, but it niggled me slightly). As far as performances go, well everyone did a great job but I particularly liked Tom Hiddleston as Loki.Of course there are plot holes here, as there are in all superhero films and I'm not going to chime on about them now, I'm sure there are many out there that are better qualified than me so I'll leave it to them. What I took away from it was a very entertaining film with a lot of (sometimes subtle) humour and I really enjoyed it. The narrative did seem to get a little stuck in a couple of places though, like when Thor arrived and ended up having a fight with Iron Man, but I can forgive these because as a whole it all worked pretty well. I was a little disappointed with the back-story to Black Widow and Hawkeye, it was only alluded to quite briefly and, I guess because they are more minor characters, I wanted to know a little more about them.

2012-05-04,"Look I'm never one for analyzing superhero movies too much. They usually fail to impress although the last 2 featuring the individual Avengers namely Thor and Captain America were definitely cause to be hopeful. Then comes along a trailer of ""Avengers"" containing an impressive ensemble of superheroes Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Hawkeye, Black Widow and most importantly The Hulk.OK, so it can either be something or nonsense, thought I.But I seriously never thought that I would come out of the theater with a smile saying that it was totally worth it. I repeat the summary statement, Avengers is probably the best superhero movie ever made. It has the story, which is although not unlike many other such movies, but is treated and presented very very well. Well, I don't know about you, but at least me and a sizable few million other people loved it. The action does not disappoint in the least but instead of making the audience run headlong into it, it is built up slowly but surely.

2012-05-19,"Superhero movies. Now that's a name that brings to mind images of cliché- filled action sequences, non-interesting and non-involving storyline, and either ridiculously bad-ass or plain dumb actor/actress performances. That's what most superhero movies has been as of recently, with a few exceptions. Now, why should this movie be any different? I mean, this time it's not only one hero, but six (I think at least), so why in h*ll should this be anything else but good-looking yet pointless action times 6? That was a thought that flew through my head, yet so many had said and written so much good about this movie, that I still had to see it. So, I phoned a friend, we booked tickets, and today we went to watch this could-be- good-but-probably-not-so-very-good movie. I had expectations, of course, and they were met all right, with loads to cover them like 10 times or something. Because, needless to say really, I was wrong, horribly wrong.This movie has all this would-be eye-candy action that can make a movie look awesome, but that's about it. But, this movie had so much more. It had dept, it had personality and it had a sound and believable identity. And most of all, it had a story. Not the best one in history, but more than good enough to keep you glued to the seat for the major part of the movie. The action packed scenes and stunning visuals did the rest of that job.So, now I've given you my story of this encounter with a turn-point in my life, and it really have been. I went in somewhat excited yet skeptical, and came out a believer. Because that certainly is the case. I have had renewed faith in superhero movies, because this movie, The Avengers, has shown me that this genre still have the ability to deliver. Now,I'm not saying that this will automatically become the best movie of the year overall, but it will definitely be a worthy candidate.",9.0,2012-05,Saturday,"10:0.05, about:0.07, action:0.11, actor:0.06, all:0.07, and:0.20, any:0.04, anything:0.06, as:0.03, at:0.03, avengers:0.03, awesome:0.05, bad:0.05, be:0.14, because:0.12, become:0.07, been:0.08, best:0.07, brings:0.06, but:0.16, came:0.06, can:0.03, certainly:0.07, could:0.04, course:0.06, definitely:0.06, did:0.04, different:0.05, else:0.06, enough:0.05, expectations:0.06, few:0.05, for:0.02, genre:0.06, given:0.06, good:0.15, had:0.33, has:0.09, have:0.08, hero:0.05, in:0.10, interesting:0.06, is:0.02, it:0.17, job:0.05, keep:0.06, least:0.06, life:0.06, like:0.03, ll:0.06, look:0.06, looking:0.06, make:0.04, many:0.04, me:0.04, mind:0.06, more:0.07, most:0.08, movie:0.19, movies:0.09, much:0.07, my:0.10, not:0.10, now:0.18, of:0.15, one:0.05, only:0.04, or:0.07, out:0.03, overall:0.05, packed:0.06, part:0.05, performances:0.06, point:0.06, probably:0.06, really:0.07, rest:0.06, right:0.05, said:0.06, say:0.04, scenes:0.04, see:0.03, sequences:0.06, should:0.10, so:0.20, something:0.05, still:0.09, story:0.07, storyline:0.06, superhero:0.11, than:0.04, that:0.26, the:0.19, them:0.04, they:0.03, think:0.04, this:0.23, thought:0.05, through:0.05, time:0.03, times:0.11, to:0.15, ve:0.05, very:0.04, was:0.05, watch:0.04, we:0.08, went:0.13, were:0.04, what:0.03, why:0.10, will:0.07, with:0.07, would:0.04, written:0.06, wrong:0.13, year:0.06, yet:0.17, you:0.05"
2020-08-05,"This was a very widely anticipated film and it had a big impact as well. Yet it did not leave much of an impression on me. The only thing I'll give it credit for is balancing all of the cast quite well. It features a lot of main characters and juggles their screentime quite effectively.

Edward Norton, a great Hulk himself, would not have fit in with the team. Now that I even try to think of it, I think this film would not have been nearly as great with him in it.As for the rest of the cast, it was well rounded, well written, and was fairly proportioned, considering the size of the team (No single actor got too much screen time, not even top billed Robert Downey Jr.) Joss Whedon did a spectacular job.

2012-05-04,"If you had asked me a few months ago if I was exited for the Avengers, I would have said, ""A little bit."" But then the trailer made my jaw drop when I saw the giant snake decepticon from Transformers 3 crash through that building while chasing Iron Man. So I joined the many who got hyped for this film, in fact like many others I had an Avengers marathon leading up to it. And I can say that this is the best Avenger's movie we've gotten so far. It has everything I liked from the other five, while taking out some of the stuff I didn't.Let's just get a few problems I had out of the way. Like the other five, there are points where it does feel slow and gets a little boring, but they are few and far in between. At times it focused too much on one member and not enough on the others. Some of the effects were clearly CGI, and it might be a little too long. I know it's only about an hour and eleven minutes, but it did feel a little longer.Other than that, I really enjoyed this movie. The action scenes are great, especially the final battle. So much stuff gets destroyed. There was one shot that reminded me of that action scene in TinTin. Where they have one continuous shot go to all the members of the Avengers fighting. It doesn't last as long, but it was still cool. Most of the time the special effects were good. And I really liked the characters. Iron Man was hilarious, which is the way I think he should be, Robert Downey Jr. is great. Thor was a little more serious this time, and it actually worked, I don't know how, but it did. Black Widow was hot, Hawkeye was cool, and I actually really liked The Hulk, he had the absolute funniest scene in the movie. The acting all around is good, and I actually thought Loki was a great villain. In Thor he was OK, but I always knew Thor could beat him. In this, he actually gets pretty far, and it made me wonder how the Avengers would defeat him. And that is a big strength for this movie, there's actually quite a bit of suspense.I didn't think I would say this, but the Avengers is my favorite movie of the year so far.

2014-01-12,"Sure, the special effects are amazing: if you remember the ""FF"" movies that are just a decade old, they appear now totally outmoded. If you compare with the ""Transformers"" that are more recent, sure, the movie is better visualized: it isn't a change of shoot each second, it's more focused about the characters and less on pure crazy action thus you can follow what happens. Sure, the casting is experimented and it was cool to see that Johnny Storm has become Steve Rogers as the actor was really cool in the aforementioned ""FF"" movies. Sure, it has some good lines (about Legolas), a real understanding of those icons (example: Hulk trying to move Thor's hammer), original new mysteries (who are the shadow people?). Sure, it adapts one of the best comics stories (the super hero who turns bad and destroys a Shielb base was Millar's ""enemy of the state""). And all this for only ""4"" ?Yes, because the first hour is totally boring: i have even slept in this black night. Also, because the screenwriter of super heroes lacks the talent of the comics writer. Stan the man who invented the Avengers could tell the same story in 22 pages: it was fast, easy to understand: Here, the plot is unintelligible, uses and abuses of scientific concepts and stupid name (tesserac?). Also, because i have the feeling to have missed a movie (what about the story about Black Widow and Hawkeye?). Also because the alien invasion is just destroy for destroy so the last hour is an astounding but hollow action scene.

2012-05-04,"um... yeah this movie sucks. Probably the worst superhero movie ever made..... Bazinga! I'm just joking. Its sarcasm. This movie is the total package. The entertainment value of this film is just through the roof. From the beginning you are instantly hooked. When I first watched the trailer, I knew this movie would be awesome! It did not fail to deliver. Packs an epic punch when you watch this. For the record, I have not seen the other ""Hulk"" films because 1) He really isn't a favorite character of mine and 2) The CG look of the Hulk just didn't appeal to me. You watch the Hulk in this film and your like ""Whoa!"" Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk was just pure genius. Each superhero gets equal screen time. No one is above anyone and I actually preferred that. This film is full of star power and I'm glad everyone got their share. I am a visual effects artist and the effects for this film was just pure bred artistic masterpiece. I thought that Transformers 3 was just awesome in terms of the the visual effects, but The Avengers is just superb!! The plot and character development is great!

2012-05-05,"Flashback to 2008. I was clapping my hands along with many others in a packed theater as the end credits of Iron Man rolled on the screen. But as the credits finished, a hush fell over the crowd. A new scene played out, in which we were introduced to Nick Fury. A collective gasp was let out by those of us in the know when he said the word ""Avengers"".Four years and four films later, that little tease has become the biggest and best superhero movie of all time.One of the best things about the Avengers is that there's no need for an origin. Thanks to the other films, we already know these characters and have seen them in action. This allows the filmmakers to get the ball rolling quickly. And boy, does it ever roll. It hits the ground running and doesn't stop until the end. But that doesn't mean it's just a mindless action movie. The character development here is great and the chemistry is amazing. You feel their frustration when the group falls apart and share in their triumph when they ""assemble"".Simply put, it's the most entertainment I've gotten out of a film in a very long time. Seeing those characters together on the big screen spoke directly to the 10 year old in me. I can't recommend it enough.

OK it's entertaining, it's a blockbuster with a lot of budget and special effect and action, but the story is casual and predictable, same thing for the characters ! I really don't get how people could have been so excited for something like that...The worst part ? If a movie so casual has that much success, the directors of the sequels won't make any effort to make a better work on the story... The second Avengers movie did confirms that, it was even worse (but apparently a lot of cuts where made because it was too long otherwise, maybe the DVD/BR version will be a little better).Of course not all the Marvel movies are like that fortunately ! I'm open minded and I love cinema so I did try some other stuff the Marvel studios made, so I can highly recommend ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (I loved it) and the ""Ant Man"" that was nice too.

2012-05-05,"This is the first review I have written on this website, but having seen some of the negative reviews for what I feel is a brilliant film, I felt the need to weigh in.The Avengers does everything that it sets out to do perfectly, it pulls of huge action scenes with 6 major characters without making them compete for screen time, it has funny and clever dialogue and it manages to actually give the film a strong sense of continuity with the previous titles in the ""series"" in a way which works very well.I saw this film with my 13 year old brother and for once we both agreed with regards to our opinion of a film: we loved it. The action was impressive, the jokes were funny and the characters were likable.The main area of criticism I have seen so far seems to be that this movie does not ""deserve"" to be held in the same regard as other high scoring films on this website. All I can say is that this film is pure and simple fun, it is well worth the money and is well worth your time to go and see.

2012-05-04,"This movie was absolutely a masterpiece of direction. Josh Whedon literally knocks them out of the park again and again. This movie has an opinion, a vision and a determination to deliver on them in spades. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!It's to Marvel's credit that they managed to pulled off the long windup of movies presenting each of the individual characters as well as they did (even if it's taken them a few tries on the Hulk...). There choices of directors has been relatively spot on both for pulling off the individual movies, but also to deliver enough stylistic continuity across all the movies such that they could eventually all come together in the The Avengers. Joe Johnston, Ang Lee, Louis Leterrier, Jon Favreau, and even Kenneth Branagh (almost unbelievably) all did stand-up work setting the stage for this film. Of the bunch, I personally think Jon Favreau really hit the nail on the head and set the tone for this movie with his stellar work on Iron Man and Iron Man 2.Kudos to the Marvel Team for sticking with it all and delivering a home run at the end of the series.[ Sidebar: Oh, and Hunger Games was a complete and utter creative failure in both vision and execution compared to this movie.

2012-05-03,"I think this movie was made for 16-year-olds who've never heard of the word ""hegemony"". Who just want Hulk to rescue Iron Man without understanding what motivates his change of heart towards Tony Stark or who see nothing wrong with shots concentrating on Scarlett Johansson's butt and don't understand the inner conflict of the characters.The film tries to use humour and action sequences to gloss over poor story development, poor character choices and action sequences that really don't propel the story or characters forward but that seem to happen for their own sake.On the plus side, there are some very clever, witty lines especially from Tony Stark but they're a wasted opportunity to explore Thor and Loki's relationship more, which was set up so well in the Thor movie.Unfortunately the movie is full of so many clichés that you see them coming a mile away. There's also a lot of cringeworthy dialogue trying to sound profound - if that's not bad enough, the film has no heart. Something that the 1st Iron Man and Thor movie had in spades.There was a clear arch with the characters - we knew what their pain is and what they needed to get by the end of the film. The Avengers in this movie are paper cut-outs with no depth.They're almost parodies of themselves and this is very obvious with Hulk vs Bruce Banner, which is a pity because the animated series on SABC 3 currently shows how interesting the character dynamics can be without sacrificing what makes each character tick.Here I didn't feel anything for the characters, I didn't care whether they live or die or get anything new that we haven't seen in their past incarnation. Instead I was bombarded by dumb 1980's drivel about how we need big brother America and ""Right is might mentality"" ... ja nee ... actually the film is more about how America sees itself and what it thinks. A not-so-subtle indoctrination into why we need ""Team America World Police"" this time in form of the Avengers.It's a pity that a movie with no proper character development, a story with no build (it's actually a throwback to a time were escapist films were far removed to anything resembling peoples lives, values or a smart comment on our times) will make millions until people realize that the emperor is naked like they did with Spiderman 3.Well, if you want a movie where you will check out your brain at the door and watch things explode, then this movie is for you. If you want to laugh in short bursts in between, then this movie is for you but if you want an action movie that will move you, I suggest your rent Iron Man 1 and Thor instead.",2.0,2012-05,Thursday,"about:0.06, action:0.07, actually:0.09, almost:0.05, also:0.03, america:0.09, an:0.03, and:0.17, anything:0.15, are:0.05, at:0.03, avengers:0.04, away:0.05, bad:0.04, banner:0.04, be:0.02, because:0.04, between:0.04, big:0.04, brother:0.05, bruce:0.04, but:0.06, by:0.06, can:0.03, care:0.06, character:0.13, characters:0.11, coming:0.06, depth:0.06, development:0.10, dialogue:0.05, did:0.04, didn:0.08, don:0.07, each:0.04, end:0.04, enough:0.04, especially:0.05, far:0.05, feel:0.04, film:0.10, films:0.04, for:0.10, from:0.03, full:0.05, get:0.07, had:0.03, has:0.03, haven:0.06, here:0.04, his:0.03, how:0.11, hulk:0.05, humour:0.06, if:0.12, in:0.13, instead:0.12, interesting:0.05, into:0.04, iron:0.08, is:0.15, it:0.05, itself:0.06, johansson:0.04, just:0.03, like:0.03, lines:0.05, loki:0.03, lot:0.04, made:0.03, make:0.04, makes:0.04, man:0.08, many:0.04, might:0.05, more:0.06, movie:0.19, need:0.10, never:0.04, new:0.04, no:0.13, not:0.05, nothing:0.05, of:0.13, on:0.10, or:0.15, our:0.05, out:0.03, over:0.04, own:0.04, past:0.06, people:0.04, re:0.10, really:0.03, right:0.04, scarlett:0.04, see:0.06, seem:0.06, seen:0.04, sequences:0.10, series:0.06, set:0.05, short:0.06, so:0.08, some:0.03, something:0.04, stark:0.09, story:0.09, team:0.04, that:0.17, the:0.32, their:0.09, them:0.03, then:0.08, there:0.08, they:0.13, things:0.05, think:0.04, this:0.10, thor:0.11, time:0.06, times:0.05, to:0.16, tony:0.09, understand:0.06, until:0.06, up:0.03, ve:0.04, very:0.06, want:0.18, was:0.08, watch:0.03, we:0.14, well:0.06, were:0.06, what:0.14, where:0.04, which:0.07, who:0.10, why:0.04, will:0.09, with:0.14, without:0.09, witty:0.06, world:0.04, wrong:0.06, year:0.05, you:0.19, your:0.08"
2012-05-13,"This is one of the best action films I have ever seen. But it's not the best superhero or comic book movie ever. Bests are TDK, Sin City, and History of Violence (to me anyways). I'm being very nitpicky here, so when I say some things, I'm not saying it's a bad movie. I loved it. It's just that it could have been better. And speaking ""being better"" the film could have done more on Thor and Loki's relationship. Thor is very underplayed here as a character. He is wiser and cooler than the last film but he has no character or chemistry between others. Sure, there are some scenes where Loki and Thor are doing ""Shakespeare in the park"" but it could have gotten a lot somber-er or emotional to us. Plus Loki was very one dimensional here, his goal is very stupid and I am actually glad that Whedon took note of that but he could have at least try to make Loki interesting. He is cool and all but his objectives are so pointless, he's basically a joke in this film. Whedon could have made him a lot more terrifying and less cheesy (although Whedon's goal probably was cheesy for this film). The scene where Black Widow is interrogating Loki is awesome, he should have been more like that. He's really threatening but he's also an indirect comic relief. Another problem I had with this film was the dialog, there were a lot of funny lines but Whedon could have done sooo much better. The dialog for Cabin in the Woods was just fantastic! It could've been like that here but it just became corny. All the ""serious"" lines are sooo corny and sometimes unbearable. And although there are some negatives, Whedon does do a great job at sometimes making some corny scenes pretty funny.And those are my negatives about this movie. I'm not going to write a lot about the awesome things about this movie because I'll be repeating what everyone has said. Yes, this film is beautiful. Yes, it is action packed fun. Yes, it is funny... But if I had to add anything else, Whedon did terrifically by making this film feel right. It's a movie for everyone. I definitely recommend everyone to see it. It's a wonderful film. It doesn't have an amazing story to tell, and in fact the story is very commonplace. It's like Indiana Jones + Seven Samurais.

2012-05-04,"""Spolier Alert"". Don't read further if you feel you don't wanna get your hopes too high. Trust me guys the movie is so freaking awesome any superhero movie fan would be in for a treat! But the least you expect from it, the more you would enjoy and savor each and every 150 minute of this flick!My hands have been itching to write this review from the moment the end credits rolled on the screen.To start off, Take a Bow and Applaud Mr Joss Whedon, the Director and Writer of this movie. He has done what countless movie makers couldn't achieve when they attempted to make a super hero movie with the same set of characters and actors. His ensemble of superheroes has more character depth, more action, more story and some effervescently witty dialogues than any of the other solo movies based on the characters of this film. Whedon has come up with a script that's cheeky and breezy, full of witty banter and sly pop-culture shout-outs as well as self-referential humor, one that moves with an infectious energy that (almost) makes you lose track of its two-and-a-half-hour running time.The hype has been building for years and it couldn't possibly be more deafening at this point. Four years ago around the same time, ""Iron Man"" arrived in theaters and kicked off a bold, long-term plan (by Hollywood standards, at least) that would see four different Marvel superheroes appear in their own solo movies, then unite in a single film featuring not just all of the previous films' stars, but many of their supporting cast, too.What's unbelievable, though, is that despite all of the odds against it and the stratospheric expectations heaped upon it, ""The Avengers"" still manages to not only live up to those expectations, but to exceed them with an epic adventure that's just as impressive as its larger-than-life characters.For a film that required so many prologues to get to this point, it's surprising how little up-front exposition is required to bring newcomers up to speed with ""The Avengers"" universe. While the film clearly assumes some familiarity with the main characters and a few basic plot points of the preceding films (""Iron Man,"" ""The Incredible Hulk,"" ""Thor,"" ""Iron Man 2,"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger""), co-writers Joss Whedon and Zak Penn have done a great job of weaving any necessary information into the early portions of the film and making the exposition feel organic.The premise of ""The Avengers"" is this: Thor's evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has returned, and he plans to use the Tesseract (the powerful, glowing blue cube last seen in ""Captain America"") to take over Earth. When Loki proves too powerful for Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and S.H.I.E.L.D. to take down on their own, all of the characters from the previous Marvel Studios films team up to defeat Loki and the alien horde helping him.To be honest on the face of it, the plot does seem to be taken straight out of a comic book, and is laughably old-school in its simplicity, but its genius lies in how this bare-bones narrative foundation allows the film's talented cast and creative team the room to do what they do best.It's the sort of adventure that comic fans are accustomed to seeing in print, but just like the best comics, ""The Avengers"" truly shines in how it fills out its narrative skeleton and the area around these tropes with vibrant storytelling, compelling character development, and moments filled with so much heart – and humor – that the entire package stands on its own.Joss Whedon has pulled off the tricky feat of juggling a large ensemble cast and giving everyone a chance to shine, of balancing splashy set pieces with substantive ideology. Stuff gets blown up real good in beautifully detailed 3-D in ""The Avengers"" — the area in and around Grand Central Terminal, for example, gets obliterated beyond recognition in an exhausting, climactic battle — but the film as a whole is never a mess from a narrative perspective.Read more at : http://devlifeintechnicolor.com/2012/05/01/the-avengers- the-best-superhero-movieneed-i-say-more/",10.0,2012-05,Friday,"2012:0.04, action:0.02, actors:0.03, against:0.04, alien:0.04, all:0.04, almost:0.03, america:0.04, an:0.06, and:0.28, any:0.08, are:0.02, around:0.10, as:0.08, at:0.06, avenger:0.04, avengers:0.09, awesome:0.03, battle:0.03, be:0.07, been:0.05, best:0.06, book:0.03, bring:0.04, brother:0.03, but:0.08, by:0.02, captain:0.04, cast:0.08, character:0.04, characters:0.09, come:0.03, comic:0.05, comics:0.03, couldn:0.08, credits:0.04, depth:0.04, development:0.04, different:0.03, director:0.03, do:0.05, does:0.03, don:0.05, done:0.06, down:0.03, each:0.02, earth:0.03, end:0.03, enjoy:0.03, ensemble:0.08, entire:0.04, epic:0.04, every:0.03, everyone:0.03, evil:0.04, expect:0.04, expectations:0.07, face:0.04, fan:0.03, fans:0.03, feel:0.06, few:0.03, film:0.12, films:0.08, first:0.02, for:0.07, four:0.08, from:0.07, full:0.04, fury:0.03, get:0.05, gets:0.07, giving:0.04, good:0.02, great:0.02, guys:0.04, half:0.04, has:0.12, have:0.03, he:0.04, hero:0.03, hiddleston:0.03, high:0.03, him:0.03, his:0.02, hollywood:0.04, hour:0.04, how:0.07, hulk:0.02, humor:0.06, hype:0.04, if:0.02, impressive:0.04, in:0.16, incredible:0.03, into:0.02, iron:0.06, is:0.07, it:0.09, its:0.15, jackson:0.03, job:0.03, joss:0.07, just:0.05, last:0.03, least:0.07, life:0.03, like:0.02, little:0.03, loki:0.06, long:0.03, main:0.03, make:0.02, makes:0.03, making:0.03, man:0.06, many:0.05, marvel:0.04, me:0.02, moment:0.04, moments:0.03, more:0.14, movie:0.06, movies:0.04, much:0.02, my:0.02, never:0.03, nick:0.03, not:0.03, of:0.23, off:0.08, old:0.04, on:0.08, one:0.02, only:0.02, other:0.02, out:0.04, over:0.03, own:0.09, plot:0.05, point:0.07, previous:0.07, read:0.08, real:0.03, review:0.04, same:0.06, samuel:0.03, say:0.03, screen:0.03, script:0.03, see:0.02, seeing:0.03, seem:0.04, seen:0.03, set:0.07, single:0.04, so:0.05, some:0.04, stars:0.04, start:0.04, still:0.03, story:0.02, stuff:0.04, super:0.03, superhero:0.04, superheroes:0.05, take:0.09, team:0.05, tesseract:0.04, than:0.04, that:0.12, the:0.49, their:0.06, them:0.02, then:0.03, these:0.03, they:0.04, this:0.09, thor:0.04, those:0.03, though:0.03, time:0.04, to:0.21, tom:0.03, too:0.07, truly:0.04, two:0.03, universe:0.04, up:0.12, well:0.02, what:0.06, whedon:0.09, when:0.04, while:0.03, whole:0.03, with:0.13, witty:0.08, would:0.07, years:0.06, you:0.08, your:0.03"
2012-05-05,"What should you do when you have been a self proclaimed fan, who has decided that he would make a movie and bring all the superheroes from that universe under one arc? Step 1: Go to the studio bosses and convince them of the idea.Step 2: Talk to other directors and ask them to incorporate certain elements from the Big Picture, that would help bring the final story in play. (Introduction of Nick Fury in Iron Man, continue in Iron Man 2 and Captain America, Black Widow in Iron Man 2, Hawkeye in Thor)Step 3: Convince a superhero to play a guest role in another Superhero Movie. (Iron Man offering his consulting services in The Incredible Hulk)Step 4: Now that all the superheroes have been linked under the mouthful acronym S.H.I.E.L.D.S, you have the right background to bring the Avenger Initiative to the foreground.Step 5: Go ahead and flesh out the story. But make sure, you play to the strengths of the each character. (Iron Man is sarcastic and arrogant with tongue in cheek one liners. So he should get the best lines. Captain America is the leader, so when the time comes he should bring the superheroes together and lead them to the final battle. Thor is the Norse God and the only one who can bring Loki to Justice. Hulk is remorseful of his past deeds, yet he is still angry, indestructible as the green giant, and can practically smash anything. So his actions should speak louder than any words. Nick Fury is the leader of the avenger initiative and he should do all that is necessary to motivate the super heroes. Black Widow is the spy and her strengths also include close quarter hand to hand combat. Hawkeye is the expert marksman and practically shoot down anything with the arrows.) Now that you know that the characters and their strengths, you should ensure they get on with each others like a house on fire. Throw in friendly banter, ego clashes, battle of brawns and brains in good measure. Then when all hell breaks loose, bump off a character to motivate the super heroes to band together. Then go all out in the climatic battle sequence with action, extravagance and general dose of humor.Step 6: Now add a crackling screenplay to go with that goldmine story and you are almost ready.Step 7: Take it back to the Studio Bosses and convince them of the plot. If need be, use a flashy power point. It usually works for all corporate presentations and makes everybody happy.Step 8: Now that the studio has green lit the project, sign up the Actors who will make up the Marquee lineup and you are good to go.Step 9: If you have the faith, then go ahead and direct it. Bring in a good cinematographer and you are good to go. But don't forget to add a crackling soundtrack to match the mayhem on the screen.Now for the outcome. Brilliant action, impressive 3D effects, superb character play and some genuine laugh out loud moments make The Avengers one hell of a comic book adaptation. It sets the bar pretty high for other super heroes. As is the case generally, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk pale in comparison to Batman, Spiderman, Superman individually in terms of popularity and box office pull. But when you put them all together in one frame for all to see, they sure bring in a lot of fireworks. It would do justice to them if you could catch the individual stories of all the super heroes before you go to watch the BIG ONE, but even if you don't, there is a whole lot of essence in this story alone to keep you going. This movie has already won big reviews from the critics and fans are raving about it on the FB, with loads of stuff dedicated to that special HULK and LOKI's interaction. In the end, the big question that crosses all is has Joss Whedon succeeded in his plans. The answer is yes. He has changed the comic book to movie adaptation world and taken it to a whole new level. The bar is set pretty high for Spiderman and Batman, who follow up this year with their own series.

2012-04-30,"So After Months of waiting for it and getting some excellent reviews about it, I Finally went to see The Avengers at the Movie Theatres and Here is how i felt it was.Exciting, Visually Mesmerizing and Very Well Acted and Directed, The Avengers is superb to any movie lover and is full entertainment from the start, and the brilliant Visual Effects, the great acting by the whole cast who really justify their characters and some great Direction by Joss Whedon just makes it even better and worth the watch and great entertainment throughout the watch.The Story which is quite reknown is based on the comics named as the same, with the 6 Superhero's coming together to make an Alliance and defeat the villain Loki The Brother of Thor, who's mission is to rule the whole world and with some help of his alien friends, he gets very powerful to really test the Avengers. The Acting by the whole cast is quite superb, and every person have done their character justice by portraying these Superhero's very well, But i thought Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Tom Hiddleton as Loki really took the cake as they were quite excellent in portraying their characters. Robert Downey was his quite arrogent self as the Iron Man, Renner again gives a powerful performance as the Hawkeye and Tom Hiddleton is really good and cunning enemy who is also quite influential and powerful. The Humour by the characters are also quite good and it really does'nt let the movie go bland.The Direction by Joss Whedon in this movie is quite superb, as he has done a convincing job in making one of the best 3d movies in the past year with excellent 3D Effects, Great Acting by each and everyone in the cast which he helped in, and the shots taken in the movie(specially in the last battle in Manhatten) are really breathtaking and for that the Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey also deserves his due credit for giving us such breathtaking scenes, but Whedon has really made one of the best Visually Enthralling and one of the better Superhero movies of all time. He Does'nt let the movie go bland or boring by keeping the humour coming in, and with fight scenes in good times, he really has entertained the audience.The Story of course which is known by many comic fans is quite great and the Screenwriter who is also Joss Whedon and the derivers from the comics Whedon and Zak Penn have taken an interesting and gripping story which has ensure in entertaining the audience throughout the movie and really keeping you at the edge of your seat. The Visual effects and the 3D effects, as I said earlier are quite simply superb and one of the better 3d movies of the past year, and the 3d effects in all of the fighting scene's are really breathtaking and hats off to the visual team for doing such a great job with the visual effects which make this movie so good. The Music of the movie is quite good too and really sets the tone in the atmosphere of the movie and I really liked the background score, so Music Director Alan Silvestri also deserves his due credit for his contribution towards this movie, and the contribution by each staff really needs appreciation.This Movie really deserves a watch by anyone who likes entertaining movies and really deserves to be Seen in 3D, and this is one of the better superhero and 3d movies of the past time, and this really is a bright sign to the great summer blockbusters to come in the near future.8/10",8.0,2012-04,Monday,"10:0.02, 3d:0.19, about:0.02, acting:0.07, after:0.02, again:0.02, alien:0.03, all:0.02, also:0.09, an:0.03, and:0.33, any:0.02, anyone:0.03, are:0.05, as:0.11, at:0.03, audience:0.06, avengers:0.04, battle:0.03, be:0.01, best:0.03, better:0.08, boring:0.03, brilliant:0.03, brother:0.03, but:0.02, by:0.18, cast:0.07, character:0.02, characters:0.04, come:0.02, comic:0.02, comics:0.05, coming:0.06, course:0.03, director:0.02, does:0.04, done:0.05, downey:0.04, each:0.04, effects:0.11, entertaining:0.05, entertainment:0.06, even:0.02, every:0.02, everyone:0.02, excellent:0.08, exciting:0.03, fans:0.02, felt:0.03, fight:0.02, fighting:0.03, finally:0.03, for:0.05, from:0.03, full:0.03, gets:0.03, getting:0.03, giving:0.03, go:0.04, good:0.07, great:0.11, has:0.06, have:0.03, hawkeye:0.04, he:0.08, help:0.03, here:0.02, his:0.09, how:0.02, humour:0.07, in:0.16, interesting:0.03, iron:0.03, is:0.15, it:0.05, jeremy:0.03, job:0.05, joss:0.06, jr:0.02, just:0.01, last:0.03, let:0.06, liked:0.03, loki:0.03, made:0.02, make:0.04, makes:0.02, making:0.03, man:0.03, many:0.02, movie:0.12, movies:0.08, of:0.14, off:0.02, on:0.01, one:0.06, or:0.02, past:0.10, performance:0.03, quite:0.26, really:0.26, renner:0.05, reviews:0.03, robert:0.04, said:0.03, same:0.02, scene:0.02, scenes:0.04, see:0.02, seen:0.02, simply:0.03, so:0.04, some:0.05, start:0.03, story:0.05, such:0.05, summer:0.03, superhero:0.07, team:0.02, that:0.01, the:0.54, their:0.05, these:0.02, they:0.01, this:0.06, thor:0.02, thought:0.03, throughout:0.06, time:0.03, times:0.03, to:0.08, together:0.02, tom:0.05, too:0.02, us:0.03, very:0.05, villain:0.02, visual:0.12, was:0.02, watch:0.05, well:0.03, went:0.03, were:0.02, whedon:0.09, which:0.09, who:0.09, whole:0.08, with:0.06, world:0.02, worth:0.03, year:0.05, you:0.01, your:0.02"
2012-05-06,"I went into this with guarded optimism- let's face it, the movies that led up to it were fun but nothing more. But after seeing this movie, it not only gets my nod for best super-hero movie ever, it's probably going right into my top 10 all-time movies.Director Whedon has proved that he can take intense action, witty dialogue, and some real emotion and tie them all together into a package that never feels forced. Too often ensemble movies like this try too hard to manufacture tension between members, or artificially manufacture importance for one character at the expense of another, but everything here flows. The Avengers have always involved internal conflict, and the movie portrays it perfectly without going over the top or under-playing it at any point. It's also obvious that there is real love and respect for the characters, as it all feels true to how they were originally written.

2012-05-07,"In order to understand the situation of my review I'll clear some things up. I saw this on a regular movie screen, no 3D and no IMAX so maybe I wasn't fully engrossed in this film due to the medium I chose to view it in, but lets cut the crap, if a movie needs images popping at your face every other 30 seconds and IMAX sized screens to be ""TOTALLY AWESOME, BRUH."" it was never that solid to begin with. That being said lets analyze the film shall we? So here is the main problems with The Avengers as a whole, it relies too much action with too little meaning. What did I expect though, right? Well I expected something a little less cookie cutter than this.If Transformers is a bad movie (which it is and far worse than this.) for lacking fan service of its original audience to connect to, The Avengers is stunningly mediocre for the exact opposite reason. God bless the man or woman that enters the theater with no prior knowledge of every superhero movie released in the last 7 years, because all this film contains is fan service upon fan service. There is nothing organic about this film and it shows in spades. Everything and everyone is merely glazed over waiting for there 12 minutes of solo screen time no risks are taking and there is so much Star Wars prequels-equse action going on that it kills any tension you might have the film almost runs 150 minutes 100 of which are unnecessary fights between the bad guys and good guys or the good guys and the other good guys not gelling as a team its just an obvious film.The avengers isn't irredeemable though it has some solid performances particularly Colby Slomders of How I met Your Mother fame proves she can probably take a stab at being an action heroine on her own project and Mark Ruffalo's take on The Hulk impressed me. The action sequences while over abundant are masterfully crafted and the comedy is surprisingly what works the best in this film with several witty one liners strewn through out the film.At the end of the day I think the film was too much Bang and not enough buck. As I was leaving a gentlemen was talking to his wife and said ""I thought there would be a lot less talking."" my inner monologue rebutted ""Wanna just watch stock footage of things getting blown up and punched?"" but this is what it is. If you are a fan of superhero movies you'll probably love this. If you are fan of things that blow up and implode you'll probably love this too. Fans of focused films with a little more story and character development, maybe a risk or two being taken will probably feel the same way I do about it.My one sentence summary of The Avengers, ""2 and half hours of non-specific escapism."" I that sounds like something you like which there is no shame in then I recommend it.

2012-05-04,"Marvel's Avengers or whatever it's called in your country is the culmination of the Marvel movies that have been released promising a massive team-up between the Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and more.The ambitious film does a decent job of weaving together the various heroes so that it feels like they all serve a purpose in the film. It might seem, on first glance, hard to swallow that a film will find a character like Hawkeye as important as Thor, and one might be afraid the stalwart Captain America would be short-changed by the immensely popular Iron Man, but thankfully the characters are given reasonably equitable amounts of screen-time.Superhero films tend to be somewhat predictable, but despite the amount of promotional material released, that's one thing the film is not. I'm writing a spoiler-free review, but all I can say is that when you think you know where the film is headed, Dr Banner and his alter- ego manage to mix things up.In typical Marvel style, there are some loose ends and some mid/post-credits scenes. Stick around for the mid-credit scene if you're a longtime Marvel fan, but the end-credit scene adds very little to the experience unless you're extremely hardcore.Highly recommended for anyone who's into superhero films. For everyone else, it's an exciting action film, but if you haven't seen the other Marvel films (especially Thor), it's going to be hard to follow, but just sit back and enjoy the ride.",9.0,2012-05,Friday,"action:0.04, all:0.06, america:0.09, amount:0.09, an:0.04, and:0.12, anyone:0.08, are:0.07, around:0.08, as:0.07, avengers:0.04, back:0.07, banner:0.07, be:0.15, been:0.05, between:0.07, but:0.19, by:0.05, can:0.05, captain:0.09, character:0.05, characters:0.04, credits:0.09, does:0.06, else:0.09, end:0.06, enjoy:0.08, especially:0.07, everyone:0.07, exciting:0.09, experience:0.09, fan:0.07, feels:0.09, film:0.24, films:0.17, find:0.08, first:0.05, for:0.09, given:0.08, going:0.07, hard:0.15, have:0.04, haven:0.09, hawkeye:0.06, heroes:0.05, highly:0.09, his:0.05, hulk:0.04, if:0.09, in:0.08, into:0.06, iron:0.09, is:0.11, it:0.13, job:0.07, just:0.04, know:0.06, like:0.08, little:0.07, man:0.08, marvel:0.22, might:0.17, more:0.05, movies:0.04, not:0.04, of:0.10, on:0.04, one:0.07, or:0.05, other:0.05, re:0.15, review:0.08, say:0.06, scene:0.14, scenes:0.06, screen:0.06, seem:0.09, seen:0.06, short:0.09, so:0.04, some:0.09, superhero:0.10, team:0.06, that:0.15, the:0.41, there:0.04, they:0.04, thing:0.07, things:0.08, think:0.06, thor:0.13, time:0.04, to:0.15, together:0.05, up:0.09, very:0.05, when:0.05, where:0.06, who:0.05, will:0.05, would:0.05, writing:0.09, you:0.19, your:0.07"
2012-11-15,"From the very first scene the Avengers was exciting, funny, and kept viewers intrigued. It had a very affective beginning which is important when trying to get people interested. I think it did a good job of updating us on what the Avengers were about and where they come from. For example, they talked a lot about Captain America's past which helped to fill people in that may have not seen that movie. Something else I want to commend is the lightly serious tone that was set. There were very serious issues going on and like many movies, the characters used a lot of technical terms that the average movie goer may not understand. However, they did a nice job of not making the film so serious. They added humor in all the right places that kept the movie from becoming too slow. The first time I saw this movie in the theater, people were literally laughing out loud. You don't really expect that from a hero action movie. I was also very impressed with the realistic aspect of the film. You could tell this was a very big budget film and not a single penny was wasted.The acting was top notch. Chris Evans did a great job acting as an ""old"" man who was very impressed with all of the technology. Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner had a great chemistry that made their roles very believable. Clark Gregg (Agent Phil Coulson) was a breath of fresh air as he portrayed an agent unlike many of us is used to seeing. He also did a great job of making a character that was easy to fall in love with which is why the Avengers wanted to avenge him. Robert Downey Jr. once again proved he was the perfect choice for Iron Man aka ""Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist."" Tom Hiddleston (Loki) wasn't the usual villain but he did a great job. Finally, the one that claimed everybody's attention was Mark Ruffalo(Hulk). He captured the title as most memorable performance by far and excited little kids and adults alike.The climactic fighting scene in New York lived up to expectations. It wasn't drawn out too long and it kept viewers on the edge of their seats. They even added another conflict on top of the conflict with the bomb that was heading for New York City. My one complaint about this movie was the predictable ending. I'm not saying I wanted Iron Man to die but it would have made the movie so much more realistic had he not made it.The Avengers movie had everything you could possibly ask for in a movie. It had romance, drama, action, and a ton of humor.

2012-05-06,"The much-hyped superhero ensemble project finally sees manifestation on the big screen: the wait has been worth it.Ensemble projects like this always carry the risk of being bloated, or ruined by overkill; thankfully, Joss Whedon sees fit to not only give each of his superpowered protagonists ample screen time, but also effective characterisations, too. Hell, even Hawkeye and Black Widow--two characters who were treated as mere appendages in previous Marvel flicks--have a strong presence here. Tom Hiddleston, makes a mischievous antagonist, playing Loki as a megalomaniacal Jack the Lad with a potty mouth (never thought I'd hear the term ""mewling quim"" in a mainstream, all-ages flick); but the strongest standout, for me, has to be Mark Ruffalo's ever-on-edge performance as that big green wrecking machine, the Hulk.Action-wise, there's no disappointment, with each set-piece giving our heroes an excuse to show off their pet powers. If the ensemble panning shot during the climactic battle doesn't win some sort of award for camera-work and direction, I'll be very surprised! The real mastery comes from the entwining of characterisation and conflict, with the course of the latter very much informed by (and informing) the former.In short, this is a must-see as a supe move, a summer blockbuster, and an all-round great piece of action cinema.",9.0,2012-05,Sunday,"action:0.09, all:0.08, also:0.06, always:0.09, an:0.10, and:0.15, as:0.17, battle:0.09, be:0.09, been:0.06, being:0.08, big:0.14, black:0.07, blockbuster:0.10, but:0.08, by:0.11, characters:0.05, cinema:0.10, comes:0.10, course:0.10, doesn:0.09, each:0.13, ensemble:0.33, even:0.06, ever:0.07, finally:0.09, for:0.08, from:0.05, give:0.08, giving:0.11, great:0.05, has:0.11, have:0.04, hawkeye:0.07, here:0.08, heroes:0.07, hiddleston:0.08, his:0.06, hulk:0.05, if:0.06, in:0.10, is:0.03, it:0.03, joss:0.07, like:0.05, ll:0.10, loki:0.06, makes:0.08, mark:0.07, marvel:0.05, me:0.06, much:0.12, must:0.08, never:0.08, no:0.06, not:0.04, of:0.18, off:0.08, on:0.09, only:0.06, or:0.06, our:0.10, performance:0.10, powers:0.11, previous:0.09, real:0.09, ruffalo:0.07, screen:0.14, see:0.06, set:0.10, short:0.11, show:0.10, some:0.06, summer:0.11, superhero:0.06, that:0.04, the:0.43, their:0.06, there:0.05, this:0.07, thought:0.09, time:0.05, to:0.09, tom:0.08, too:0.07, two:0.08, very:0.12, wait:0.10, were:0.06, whedon:0.06, who:0.06, widow:0.07, with:0.12, work:0.08, worth:0.09"
2012-05-06,"My only complaint about this excellent action movie with strong female characters (Marvel, can we PLEEEASE have a Black Widow movie now??? What's her story??? We want to know! She's interesting!) is that it did not pass the Bechdel Test.For those of you who don't know this test, it's three simple questions: 1) Were there two or more female characters with names? 2) Did they speak to each other at any time? 3) If yes on #2, did they speak to each other about something other than a man?The bad news is that this movie does not pass this test. But good writing is good writing... and it was so satisfying to see the story overflow with character development, cooperation and friendships. It was great seeing gorgeous Black Widow holding the team at the center as a woman (okay, an ass-kicking woman), with no fuss or sexism, just plain old everyday respect, fighting her own battles, and still be able to have a personal moment full of heart and soul.Read my essay, ""The Perilous Pumps of Pepper Potts,"" about heroines, feet, and the two main women in this movie at http://wanderingpie.blogspot.com/2012/05/avenge-this.html",8.0,2012-05,Sunday,"2012:0.10, able:0.11, about:0.18, action:0.05, an:0.05, and:0.15, any:0.07, as:0.04, at:0.16, bad:0.08, be:0.05, black:0.14, but:0.04, can:0.06, character:0.06, characters:0.10, development:0.10, did:0.21, does:0.08, don:0.07, each:0.14, excellent:0.10, fighting:0.10, for:0.04, full:0.10, good:0.11, great:0.05, have:0.09, her:0.21, if:0.06, in:0.04, interesting:0.10, is:0.10, it:0.13, just:0.05, know:0.16, main:0.10, man:0.05, marvel:0.05, moment:0.11, more:0.06, movie:0.15, my:0.11, no:0.07, not:0.09, now:0.08, of:0.10, old:0.10, on:0.05, only:0.07, or:0.11, other:0.18, own:0.09, read:0.11, see:0.06, seeing:0.10, she:0.11, simple:0.11, so:0.05, something:0.08, still:0.08, story:0.12, team:0.08, than:0.06, that:0.07, the:0.21, there:0.05, they:0.10, this:0.20, those:0.08, time:0.06, to:0.16, two:0.17, want:0.09, was:0.08, we:0.14, were:0.06, what:0.06, who:0.06, widow:0.14, with:0.16, writing:0.23, yes:0.10, you:0.05"
2012-05-22,"I can't help but be a little reminded of Sergio Aragones' take on Marvel Comics where all the marvel characters had gotten together to face off against the Seagoing Soarer, only to be reminded that whenever Marvel comic characters assemble in large numbers they must always fight amongst themselves, regardless of the reason or the consequences.Its the same with most buddy cop movies. Such introductory films require a little adversarial tension in order for headstrong individualistic alphas to come together and overcome the foe that is bigger than either could handle alone. Lethal Weapon. 48 Hours. Tango and Cash. The Last Boyscout. Red Heat. Etcetera. Etcetera.This is the same basic formula that the Avengers follows. Its a buddy cop film with more explosions and the Hulk. The animosity here, however, tends to come from the machinations of Loki, and the general distrust of working with a secret organization, albeit one with our best interests in mind.The characters are not two dimensional caricatures. Each with their own emotional weaknesses and psychological strengths. The development is meager, but adequate for an action film. One moment of blatant Chekov's Gun exists where a character's devotion is called into question and then takes on a ""suicide"" mission at the end of the final battle. I'm not quite willing to call it lazy writing at this point, but it is painfully reminiscent of the ""you're a valued part of the team, too"" episodes that every 80's cartoon series had. Multiple viewings may be needed to come to a final verdict on that minor and relatively unneeded subplot.The only other minor gripe I had with the film is that there was very few scenes where the heroes worked together in a fight. A couple more well choreographed fight scenes involving multiple heroes would have been welcome, but its nothing more than a minor inconvenience.The Earth's Mightiest Buddy Cop Film.",8.0,2012-05,Tuesday,"action:0.03, against:0.07, all:0.03, always:0.07, an:0.04, and:0.15, are:0.03, assemble:0.08, at:0.08, avengers:0.03, battle:0.06, be:0.10, been:0.05, best:0.04, but:0.11, can:0.04, character:0.04, characters:0.11, come:0.17, comic:0.05, comics:0.07, could:0.05, development:0.07, each:0.05, earth:0.06, end:0.06, every:0.05, face:0.08, few:0.06, fight:0.19, film:0.14, films:0.05, final:0.15, for:0.06, from:0.04, had:0.14, have:0.03, help:0.08, here:0.06, heroes:0.10, hours:0.08, however:0.07, hulk:0.04, in:0.10, into:0.05, is:0.14, it:0.05, its:0.15, last:0.06, little:0.12, loki:0.04, marvel:0.12, may:0.07, mind:0.07, moment:0.08, more:0.12, most:0.05, movies:0.04, must:0.06, not:0.06, nothing:0.06, of:0.18, off:0.06, on:0.10, one:0.06, only:0.09, or:0.04, other:0.04, our:0.08, own:0.06, part:0.06, point:0.07, quite:0.07, re:0.07, reason:0.08, same:0.13, scenes:0.10, series:0.08, such:0.06, take:0.06, takes:0.08, team:0.05, than:0.09, that:0.16, the:0.49, their:0.04, then:0.06, there:0.04, they:0.04, this:0.05, to:0.16, together:0.14, too:0.05, two:0.06, very:0.04, was:0.03, well:0.04, where:0.17, with:0.17, would:0.04, writing:0.08, you:0.03"
2012-05-05,"Expectations were sky high because of the excellent reviews for Avengers flooding the internet during last week.It forced me to watch the first show and it was worth the price of the ticket.Truly amazing,thats what you can call this film in terms of entertainment.Film doesn't fall short of entertainment and actors.This is a genuine multistarrer and the fans of superhero movies cant afford to miss this one.There is no point in going into the story of the movie.Its just regular stuff-A villain trying to take over the world and a superhero fighting him and saving the world.But in this movie,There is not one but 5-6 of them trying to save the world including Black widow and Hawkeye.The film begins with attack from Loki,The villain on a lab and stealing the power source.Loki also takes control of the Doctor and Hawk eye.Nick fury goes to assemble the superheroes Ironman,Black widow,Captain America,Hulk and together they fight Loki to stop his plan of raking over the world.Though there is an unexpected visit from Thor during the first hour.The rest of the movie is full of guns,shootouts,missiles and breathtaking action scenes which will hold your attention.The last 40-50 min is full of action and entertainment.The film also leaves a chance for a sequel.The first hour is somewhat slow in the middle.Many dialogues were not much audible but the movie later picks up.The introduction of characters took a long time.Indeed there are many to introduce,still that hampers the pace of the movie.The dialogues of Iron man to Captain America was great.There are comic scenes here and there.The 2nd hour is the unlimited action,full of thrills and fights.The special effects are awesome.3D was really effective,I found myself blinking on approaching missiles,Ironman and all.That is something I really miss nowadays in 3D films.3D was worth after all in a pathetic theater.On going to the performances,everyone did their part perfectly but the show stealer was Mark Ruffalo as Hulk.His intro was welcomed with tremendous applause.He rocked in the 2nd hour and his confrontation with Loki was hilarious and one of the best scenes of the movie.I didn't like the incredible Hulk but in this one,Hulk was excellent.After Hulk,credit goes to none other than one of my favourite actors Robert Downey Jr.His dialogues were cool and his performance was super cool as always.My pick is his scene with Loki.I am not adding spoilers,But Just watch out for that scene when Loki tries to take control of him and next one.That was the best scene in the movie.Chris Hemsworth as Thor did his part well.His intro was good than the others and also fight scenes.Chris Evans as Captain America was OK,nothing much to perform though.Samuel Jackson as Nick fury was good.Scarlett Johnson as Black widow looked great and performed well.Tom Hiddleston as Loki was convincing as the routine villain and Jereme Renner as Hawkeye was OK.Direction was slow in the middle but later picked up and the 2nd hour was entertaining with comic and action scenes.Dialogues were good and funny.Fight scenes are well shot and blended in the movie and even though 2nd half is full of fights,Its does not become tiresome and boring.Special applause for that.All together,Avengers is a spectacular Superhero Showdown that should not be missed for fans of Superhero movies and also for regular audience.In the box office,This one is sure to break collection records.As I said,a sequel can be expected as the film gives hints about it in the end credits.I go with a 4/5 for Avengers and it really is worth the price of the ticket.Rating 4/5:Entertainer",8.0,2012-05,Saturday,"3d:0.09, about:0.02, action:0.06, actors:0.06, after:0.05, all:0.04, also:0.09, always:0.03,

2012-05-06,"If I was to describe the Avengers in a single word it would be this: Nirvana. The film wants for nothing. There's action, story, character development, and well placed humor bits. It's everything we were promised and nothing we weren't. You want super hero conflicts? You got 'em. You want gratuitous amounts of action? You got it. You want Stan a Lee Cameo? Better question: could it be an Avenger movie at this point without one? You want Hulk Smash? You bet your sweet candy ass Hulk Smash! There are a few nit-picky things that I could say about the movie, but they all fall wildly short of what the movie gets right. This movie is a rock star affair from start to finish, with the screen play by Joss Whedon (geeks try to hold it together), and visual and sound effects done by none other than Weta studios and Skywalker light and sound.You already know the cast, we all know the score. So its time to strap in and enjoy the ride. And you had best strap in since the pace for avengers after the intro sequence is somewhere between frenetic and murderous. There really is no lull in the story or the action that lasted longer than my attention span, and that's saying something for a man with ADHD. There really is an awful lot crammed into that 2 hours and 23 minutes and believe me they make use of damn near every second. With so many stars though, it is true that some character development got sacrificed, most notably for Hawkeye, but it seems to have done very little to diminish the film as a whole.In a somewhat cross-related issue, the substitution of Mark Ruffalo for Edward Norton as Bruce Banner/The Hulk was a much welcome change in my opinion. The skinny around town is that Norton wanted more money than Marvel was willing to put up and negotiations broke down. Bet he'll be kicking himself in the ass for that choice come Monday. Especially considering how many fans of the hulk this film is likely to generate. But I've always found Norton to be a little annoying and Ruffalo does a great job, but that's just my opinion. All the other characters are amazing too, Cap is great, Iron Man steals the stage whenever he can (but not as much as I thought he would) and Thor actually levels out a bit to make a fuller transition from brash youth to wise veteran warrior.A final word on 3D and IMAX: See it in IMAX 3D, it's absolutely astounding! Catch the matinée showing if you have to, but don't miss your chance because it really does impact the cinematic experience. And as always STAY AFTER THE CREDITS and I do mean STAY AFTER ALL THE CREDITS. Seriously, YOU WON""T WANT TO MISS IT.Peace out.So will Avengers change the entire world as we know it?

2012-07-17,"What a terrible, terrible movie.None of the characters, and I do mean NONE is remotely interesting. In fact the only character to really stand out is Iron Man, but his ironic punchlines get old very very fast. He's just there for comic relief. But by the time he pours his 20th joke, it's just annoying.The action scenes are just boring. Watching computer-made polygons fight each other hardly matches my definition of excitement. If only I cared about the characters, I might have enjoyed them but since I didn't it was just a borefest. Here's the thing about Hollywood: they try to make action scenes as impressive as possible, but if you do not care about the characters, you won't care about what happens to them.You would have just as much enjoyment reading the script than watching this movie because the direction is non existent.

2012-05-05,"I went to this movie going 'oh my god, Michael Bay meets Spderman vs X Men or something. I didn't really had high hopes for it. But I figured 'what the hell' and went to see it anyway.Just came back from the cinema. And I must say I haven't been this entertained in a long time watching a movie. The Avengers is really a -lot- of fun to watch.first off, the scenario. Sure, the story is a bit shaky, a few plot holes here and there. But nothing that makes you go 'wtf is this nonsense?'. For a story that covers such a weird, unrealistic theme, it's pretty believable actually.The characters. This is where The Avengers shines. Throw a bunch of (some less) well known superheroes in 1 movie, throw in a semi-slapstick villain and let rip. all the characters are good. Stark, Thor and Hulk provide the lulz. Even Loki allows for a few laughs. I've never heard of Black Widow or Hawkeye but they fit in just fine and carried the story along.the action. Michael bay, take note. This is how you let stuff blow up and get demolished -without- giving the audience seizures. the action is fast paced, well times and the screenplay at times is just brilliant. hats off.the humor. the backbone of this film. very witty lines, good slapstick jokes from time to time. some hilarious (punch)lines that really make you laugh. It's not just Iron Man and his snide remarks this time. Almost everyone chips in. this movie doesn't take itself very serious at times.

2012-04-30,"I was skeptic about The Avengers. Very few heroes movies have deserved good critics, but I must admit the film is great. Great action, amazing special effects and a script that goes straight to what we expect: action and fights, the kind of things we expect from super heroes. While Transformers really sucked because of spending a lot of time on stupid romancing and forced jokes, The Avengers succeed on providing intelligent, funny scenes even in the middle of war. That being said: I've seen some comparisons between Avengers and Dark Knight. Sorry to say, but Dark Knight is miles away (and that being said by a guy who just liked Marvel comics).Now, the bad part:this movie has confirmed my feelings-3D definitely adds nothing but a discomfort to the movies. I've gone to the iMax 3D just to be sure my issue with 3D weren't the theater. No good: you can't barely notice 3D. I've seen Inception on iMax 2D: it was amazing.

2012-04-26,"Meh.In this movie there's everything you expect, just as you expect it: extremely noisy action scenes, a multimillionaire budget flaunted without restraint, superhero brawls, New York invaded by aliens for the 2.735.961th time and the usual Stan Lee cameo.I suppose that's enough to satisfy Marvel zombies.To me, it seems like Mr. Whedon worked alternating the autopilot with the Copy & Paste function. For example, the showdown against Loki's army is basically Transformers 3 final battle with different characters, and a less talented direction.The only real surprises come from humor: I have to admit that comic reliefs are effectively funny. Apart from this, you'll find nothing but cheesy costumes, woody and/or pointless dialogues, tons of derivative spectacularity and a plot that often seems to go nowhere (Black Widow, with all that chatting aimlessly about her past, is particularly confusing).And Thor's hammer is blatantly fake.",5.0,2012-04,Thursday,"about:0.08, action:0.06, against:0.14, all:0.05, and:0.21, are:0.06, army:0.14, as:0.06, battle:0.12, black:0.09, but:0.05, by:0.08, characters:0.07, come:0.11, comic:0.09, different:0.13, enough:0.12, everything:0.12, expect:0.28, final:0.15, find:0.14, for:0.11, from:0.14, funny:0.12, go:0.10, have:0.06, her:0.14, humor:0.12, in:0.05, is:0.14, it:0.09, just:0.07, less:0.15, like:0.07, ll:0.13, loki:0.08, marvel:0.07, me:0.08, movie:0.05, new:0.11, nothing:0.12, of:0.04, only:0.09, or:0.08, past:0.16, plot:0.10, real:0.13, scenes:0.10, seems:0.28, superhero:0.09, that:0.20, the:0.24, there:0.07, this:0.09, thor:0.08, time:0.07, to:0.17, transformers:0.15, whedon:0.09, widow:0.10, with:0.16, without:0.12, york:0.15, you:0.19"
2012-04-30,"Following the success of 'Iron Man' (2008) Marvel Comics came up with the idea of putting all superheroes together in 'The Avengers'. A sequel to 'Iron Man' and films like 'Thor' also played their part in building excitement in the run up to the film's release. Its biggest star, Robert Downey Jr reprises his role as Tony Stark/ Iron-Man and has Scarlett Johansson as Natalia Romanoff/ Black Widow who had a role in Iron Man 2 for company. There's Gwyneth Paltrow in a brief role as Pepper Potts. Also from the Marvel Universe, there's Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Tom Hiddleston as his brother the villain Loki, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, director of SHIELD. Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner / Hulk and Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye are the other first billed actors. The story starts at a secret facility where scientists are researching on an unknown energy source, the 'Tesseract'. Then, things go awry and a portal is opened up allowing Norse God Loki to come through. And evil Loki plans to use the power source, team up with an alien race called the Chitauri and subjugate Earth! With the world on the verge of falling apart, Nick Fury can only rely on his superheroes to save the world. But, getting these larger than life characters with massive egos to work together proves to be tougher than it seems. The rest of the story plays on the Good vs. Bad theme replete with action, stunts and cool gadgets. The film's selling point is not its theme, but the way they go about telling the story. For one, it doesn't have heroes coming together spontaneously, making speeches about good and bad and then going all out battling the bad guy. Here, they are shown to have their own issues, and obviously issues with one another. The altercation between characters gives us some really nice one-liners. One of my favorites was when Captain America asks Tony Stark/ Iron-man 'Big man, in a suit of armor, take that away, what are you?' to which Stark responds 'Uh, genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist' with his usual arrogance. 'The Avengers' is also a visual treat. Filmed on digital media, it was converted to 3D in post production and was digitally remastered to IMAX format. The special effects are state of the art and offer edge of the seat action. Although I watched it on a regular screen with 3D, it would definitely be worthwhile on IMAX. Since it is based on a comic-book theme and Superhero theme, there are those who may choose to skip on the pretext that comics are just for kids.

2012-04-26,"Anzac day. Public holiday. Late night session. Not an empty seat in the house. The atmosphere was at a deserved premium for the year's most anticipated film, and The Avengers did not disappoint. The king of sci-fi television, director Joss Whedon (Buffy, Firefly) enlists the help of one Samuel L. Jackson in assembling Earth's mightiest heroes to protect humanity against the greatest threat to our existence in history. Sounds pretty stockstandard, right? It should, because The Avengers makes no move towards trying to reinvent the genre, but rather takes everything that makes a film like this enjoyable and cranks it to eleven, proving there's some life in the blockbuster yet.All is peaceful on planet Earth with the all-powerful Cosmic Cube safely in the hands of Nick Fury and SHIELD. That is until Loki, Thor's evil half-brother from another realm, storms the castle and commits larceny of the grandest scale. His actions convince Fury that the world is indeed at war, and he is left with no choice but to reinstate the Avengers Initiative. With it, he brings together The Hulk, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye and the big cheese Iron Man to take down this mighty foe. Unfortunately, all signs point to the superheroes killing each other before saving the Earth. 'Cause, you know, priorities.The film's unquestioned drawcard has always been its ensemble cast and, more importantly, the potential for spectacular chemistry between the leads. This forced sceptics to beg the question: How long will this gimmick last before everyone starts to get in each other's way? The final product allays such concerns with ease, as Whedon, his fellow writers and the actors all deserve equal credit for their depiction of the superteam as the ultimate dysfunctional family. To the mere mortal, a superhero can appear angelically honourable and beyond reproach. Throw four of five of them into one room and they become stubborn, irritable and deviously arrogant just like the rest of us. Watching this dynamic progressively unfold throughout the film is a treat, as the Avengers bicker over almost anything, all with a watch-me-prove-I'm-better-than-you macho attitude. A witty script almost entirely devoid of clichés that allows room for sufficient individual character development certainly helps this dynamism. Stark copes with fighting for something greater than himself for once, Banner draws sympathy as a brilliant mind struggling with a crippling case of split personality and the contrasting ideas Thor and Loki possess regarding freedom, arguably the film's most prominent theme, all contribute to the film's depth without disrupting the excellent pacing.Walking into this film in the right frame of mind, one would find most minor flaws few and far between. Not every one-liner or scripted joke hits the mark, in typical Marvel fashion, and Cobie Smulders' character comes off as underused and unnecessary in stark contrast (no pun intended) to her prominence in the trailers. Kudos must also go to the execution of the 'megascene', that is, the forty-minute climactic battle between the Avengers and Loki's army. While it is certainly nothing new, the megascene has become more and more of a staple in major action franchises of late, including the last Harry Potter and Transformers films. The ambitious nature of the set piece by sheer design means things can get ugly and repetitive in a hurry if care is not taken to ensure the audience is engaged at all times (see: Dark of the Moon). With The Avengers, though, the final act is not only visually fascinating, but also mentally stimulating, constantly jumping between various settings and characters involved, with new developments occurring every couple of minutes to ensure one doesn't even come close to losing interest. After a string of commercially dominant but critically indifferent projects, it appears Marvel has finally hit the jackpot in every sense of the word.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

2013-05-08,"As you probably will notice from reading the reviews here on IMDb, this movie is quite the hit or miss.I don't read the Marvel comics, but I have always been interested in the Marvel universe, the heroes, the foes etc. I actually like most of the movie adaptations, even if they're silly, predictable and poorly written sometimes.But this one, this one became my favorite Marvel movie to this date. Why? It gave me the exact thing I wanted, heroes interacting with each other, LOTS of action and an epic finale.If you're not a fan of superhero movies, hate action and can't watch an old concept without whining about it being an old concept, you will most likely not be entertained by this.My only complain with this movie is that it should have had at least one more non-S.H.I.E.L.D. hero. It was kinda awkward with the whole superhero group-thing with just Iron Man and Captain America sitting there in one scene.

2012-04-29,"When I first heard of the idea to actually produce an Avengers film I was of course intrigued, as the idea of making a super-team movie had never been accomplished before. But the Marvel Universe films had all been cleverly inter-connected and the stage was ripe for the Avengers to be made. Naturally in a film with so many A list actors, so many hero's and so many ego's, the potential for disappointment was vast, but I'm happy to say The Avengers was thoroughly enjoyable. The script is funny, the action comes thick and fast, and is choreographed much better than in any of the other Marvel films, and all the things you liked or cared about the characters before has been carried on.

2012-05-05,"This movie ROCKS! I've been waiting for this movie for 37 years. Joss Whedon nailed it, the action is paced just right, with a good amount of one liners to keep it light. Robert Downey Jr. has a lot of fun as Tony Stark. The story works well and the actors sell their roles with ease. I wasn't sure about Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner, he did alright, but he's a little too beefy to be Bruce. All the other actors have played their characters before and this just cements their position. This movie is better than any of the solo hero movies that led up to it. Hopefully Joss comes back for the next one and can pull it off again. I saw the IMAX 3D version and while it looked and sounded fantastic, the 3D didn't pop as much as it could have. It had some depth but it didn't really add much. It should make a substantial amount at the the box office, and should get a few nods for the Oscars, but we all know that won't happen, the Academy always passes over movies like this.

I confess my motives for watching it were completely perverse, I went to drool over Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr, which i did but the humour it was i remember most.

For Example, why does Hawkeye have more than enough arrows while fighting against the Avengers, but as he joins 'em in their fight, runs out of arrows? Why does Hulk go berserk against everything on the shield flying boat thing, but fights with the avengers at the end, without a real reason given, even saving Iron Man?

2012-05-06,"This, by far, is the best super hero action movie, ever. Forget the actors, forget the graphics and forget the heroics of the hulk, the script is so captivating and the screen play so damn good that it is impossible to feel unimpressed when one leaves the show. I rate this 9 just because I happen to watch it with 5 of my friends, none of the group watching any of the original films of the super heroes. They were confused initially till I find sometime and give them the brief of each of them. And when the movie finished, they were grinning ear to ear, with a promise to watch all 5 movies of the super hero movies. That captivating this movie is! The movie predictably starts slow so as to introduce the superheroes and then picks up speed never to stop. The goosebumps were felt till I left the place to return the 3D glasses :DThen comes the performances. Everyone gave their best performance and the list is topped by the performances of Robert Downie Jr, Mark Ruffalo, Hiddleston and Cobie Smulders. The dialogs were crisply written, entertainingly delivered and thoroughly enjoyed! The 3D was not so worthy to die for. It my be the theater, or the glasses but it is not up to the mark of not even Mysterious Island as I found one of my friend just removing the glasses and watching the film as is. The CGI was good, Iron man just awesome and HULK, no words! I have found the trailers good but living through the scene of the group of super heroes is just a brain freezing experience for me.Go watch it and enjoy it. Definitely can be watched in 3D but 2D in a good theater works just fine. I will watch it again and might probably buy a DVD/Blu-ray for my 42"".

2012-05-02,"Starring Robert Downey Jr., Samuel L. Jackson, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans. Directed by Joss Whedon. 140 minutes. Opens midnight Thursday at major theaters. PG Agent Phil Coulson will love The Avengers. You surely will, too, if you recognize his name. Officious but lovable S.H.I.E.L.D. sleuth Phil is one of many Marvel Comics minions Joss Whedon summons to his energizing superhero adventure, making this first blockbuster of summer 2012 something of a geek drill. It helps if you go to the film having already seen the two Iron Man movies, plus Thor, The Incredible Hulk and Captain America: The First Avenger, all released between 2008-11 and leading up to this ensemble nerdgasm. But you don't have to sport a propeller beanie to enjoy The Avengers, and this may be the highest possible praise for what director Whedon and his co-writer Zak Penn have wrought. They've cannily crafted a saga guaranteed to pass muster with the Comic- Con cognoscenti, without forsaking regular popcorn munchers who just hope to see the planet get saved with maximum firepower and a few laughs. Whether you love or merely like The Avengers, it will likely all come down to the performances and not the perfunctory plot or the on-the-fly back story. You don't need to know Agent Phil's connection to the Marvel multi verse to appreciate Clark Gregg's expanded and surprisingly emotive take on him here, as a combination of fusspot and fan boy. And past knowledge of two iffy Hulk movies isn't required to marvel at the nuances that newcomer Mark Ruffalo brings to the green-skinned beast, even though ""the other guy"" within mild-mannered Dr. Bruce Banner isn't revealed until the 80-minute mark of this 140-minute bladder test.Also new to the team and the evolving Avengers narrative are Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff, a.k.a. Black Widow, a lethal gymnast who demonstrates early on that a chair makes a dandy weapon, and Jeremy Renner as special agent Clint Barton, a.k.a. Hawkeye, whose arrows aren't quite the Robin Hood anachronism they appear to be. Robert Downey Jr. returns in fine scathing form as billionaire playboy Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man, the ferrous phenomenon who shields everything except his sharp tongue. It's pretty much business as usual, meanwhile, for the two most dislocated Avengers: Chris Hemsworth's Thor, a Norse god fallen from the heavens; and Chris Evans' Steve Rogers, a.k.a.

2012-05-04,"Now this is a movie that I will recommend to anyone. It is awesome!' I been two times to see it in 3D already. It have cost me the price of $42 already (only for the tickets). But it was worth every penny spent, and for the coca-cola and popcorn I would say I have spent about $55 only on the avengers! But I am guessing for a The Avenger II and III etc. Because with Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man it is a must see. And waiting for the wolverine to come into The Avengers, I saw Iron Man/Tony Stark in the wolverine movie, so there must be another coming with the wolverine also joining the avengers. And is the biggest villain we see in the end Thanos? it must be... It is for me only Thanos and Loki that are the interesting villains. It was also a time where JLA and Avengers met together and fought villains. But not all JLA and Avengers characters are great. The best ones we would as audience see together in a battle for good I feel is: Superman, Batman, Spiderman, The Wolverine, Captain America, The Hulk, Thor and the Daredevil. Of the villains there are only some I can think of that would be supercool in a fight against evil, the evilest of them all: Doomsday, Thanos, Loki, Luthor and Zod.I am waiting and looking forward to the next round!10/10 on IMDb.com - this movie is one of the greatest action/adventure movies I ever seen.

2012-05-06,"****SMALL SPOILERS**** I'm simplifying, but only a little bit.This guy - on track record - should not be able to make films like this.He seems to fly in the face of convention - a man who appears to have an absolute passion for comic book nonsense, yet still comes up with twists of character AND manages to squeeze several massive egos (in terms of character and I dare say actors) onto the same film AND ALSO gets Disney to pony up a mega budget to do so.This just does not happen.And just to give two fingers to movie execs and critics alike - it is well written, chock full of jaw dropping set pieces and well acted.Please note some of the best performances are from people in tin suits and glittery Halloween costumes. That's how good it is.It makes you suspend your disbelief and get drawn in to a very strong parallel to modern politics - who exactly are the 'villians' anyway? - whilst managing to keep cringing moments of sentiment - see any Michael Bay flick - pretty much at arms length.Most notable are moments of the Whedon trade mark - from Firefly in particular - where he totally goes against viewer expectations with regard to conflict outcomes.Loki vs the Hulk is particularly brilliant on that front.It's a big movie. It's completely over the top comic book action and a small miracle it is as good as it is.My only gripe would be a few cheesy lines and the old US cliché of 'English accent = skinny villain' thing, but this is one hell of an action movie and a pretty good film in it's own right.AND I don't even worship Marvel stuff.

2012-05-13,"The Avengers is a fun movie, fun to watch with no feeling of shame for liking it. The plot itself might not be a masterpiece, but the characters are all very well written, some even better than in the movies that originally presented them, and good actors can do wonders with well written characters. The special effects are as good as we recently came to expect them and the pace is just perfect for the film, which is much to say for an action film that lasts more than two hours. I especially liked the performance of Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson, and Tom Hiddleston is also very impressive as the very evil Loki, but almost every one on screen does a good professional job, which has a lot to do with the way the roles were written. - I know I said it already, I simply think it deserves repeating. And just one last remark on whoever complains that the plot doesn't make any sense. If you accept super heroes, the rest comes with the territory, it's not less likely than any other comic based film I've seen. The only problem begins when the characters come out too ""cartoonish"" the acting doesn't have much to cling to, and the whole thing falls apart.

2014-10-26,"Groan. I find this movie dull, tedious and boring. It just doesn't work on any level Let's start with the Hero's. For a start there's too many. Their characters only get enough screen time to be show in one shade. All exempt iron man who is show to be like a god or something, and that is daft.The story itself makes no sense and gives the feeling that they were making it up as they went. The visuals are OK but nothing to shout about. The comedy kinda works but after you seen it once it tends to drag. It feels like they were trying to be funny instead of it being naturally funny.The avengers is the perfect example of directors thinking about money by pandering to those who have an IQ in single figures and an explosion fetish, instead of thinking about the art of creating a good movie. I would have given this film a one star but it does have one saving grace or rather three. The strong acting from hulk, Loki and captain America drag this movie though by the scruff of its neck.

2012-11-24,"You're larger than life. You have abilities beyond that of most human beings on the planet. Then the world finds itself in peril and to save it, you'll need to join a group of people just as unique as you if not more so. What do you do?S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson) is overseeing a top secret project designed to study an energy source from another world known as the tesseract. The experiment soon goes awry and the tesseract appears to explode. In actuality, it has opened a portal allowing the malevolent being known as Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston) to emerge. It's almost immediately clear that S.H.I.E.L.D. is outmatched and what's worse, the supervisor of the tesseract project Dr. Erik Selvig (played by Stellan Skarsgard) and experienced covert agent nicknamed Hawkeye (played by Jeremy Renner) became mindless drones under Loki's (Hiddleston's) command. Once the facility is destroyed and the invaders have moved on, Fury (Jackson) calls Agent Natasha Romanoff also known as the Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson) to recruit one member of The Avengers. The Avengers Initiative was abandoned some time before the events depicted in this film, but is reactivated for the sake of mankind and for lack of a better alternative. Romanoff (Johansson) is next seen in India resorting to subterfuge to gain audience with Bruce Banner (played by Mark Ruffalo). Banner (Ruffalo) has gone into hiding to escape opportunists in the American government, to remain calm, to spare the world and those around him any damage he might inflict as The Hulk. Next to be approached by S.H.I.E.L.D. is Iron Man, Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr. in the character's third major film). The last member left to recruit is Steve Rogers (played by Chris Evans), more commonly known as Captain America. When they're finally brought together, Banner and Stark are tasked with tracing the energy source and, in so doing, locating the enemy. When that's accomplished, they meet yet another traveler from worlds beyond, Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth), Loki's brother.Now, I was not really a fan of Captain America: The First Avenger, nor was I altogether pleased after seeing Thor. As for Bruce Banner's larger half, perhaps it's impossible to make a film about the incredible hulk that I wouldn't like. First there was the Ang Lee/ Eric Bana film, then the Edward Norton film, both of which I enjoyed. Still, I did like Ruffalo. Also, Thor, Captain America, and the Black Widow made individual contributions to enrich the story. Hiddleston may not be as physically imposing as Chris Hemsworth, but as an egomaniacal extraterrestrial, he is truly terrifying. I can't comment on whether the 3-D effects added anything, as I saw it in 2-D, but regardless, The Avengers was incredible. The one thing I might say was lacking was Iron Man's best friend James Rhodes wearing an armored flight suit of his own and going by the name War Machine. We caught a glimpse of that suit in action in Iron Man 2 but it was nowhere to be seen here and I thought the film was worse off for it. Still, very exciting, highly entertaining, and one great ride.

2012-05-06,"The Avengers is the most fun, crowd-pleasing movie I've seen in years. Its no wonder Marvel's The Avengers shattered the box office record with over 200,000,000 dollars domestic this weekend. It's barely been out and its made half a billion dollars. The Avengers has been around for about 50 years and after 5 movies leading up to this, the Avengers delivers. The theater was a mad house when I saw it Saturday. There were little kids and old people as well. This movie is great for all ages. The older people finally get to see the super heroes they grew up with finally on the big screen and the little kids will get great role models to look up to. The movie puts great emphasis on how teamwork results in victory. The character development is great. Each superhero gets enough screen time, but the Hulk steels the show and is sure to be everyone's favorite. The best moments in the movie are when the Hulk is on screen. They did a good job on showing how Captain America assumed the leader position on the team. Iron Man/ Tony Stark is witty as always and Thor is also cool. The team is balanced and everyone, even puny Hawk Eye and Black Widow, contributes. This movie has it all. Great action, character development, comedy, and story. It can be a little cheesy but in a good way. There are moments when the whole theater will laugh, clap and cheer. Its a fun way to start off summer. I know I'm picking this up as soon as it hits the shelves. Along with Spiderman 2 and Dark Knight, the Avengers is one of the best superhero movies to date.

The script cast some stellar characters with interesting backgrounds.In theory this movie should have been tailored to my liking.Unfortunately...I spent the first half of the movie dead bored and wondering how much was left. What this film lacked was character. We didn't see any depth of character. It doesn't matter that the actors or actress showed great facial expressions (reactions), their character was never explored beyond that. They remained flat, personable characters.And yes, I did read the arguments all over the internet: ""That's what the other movies were for. They showed character. Go watch those.""

2012-05-04,"As I reflect on my experience tonight watching the Avengers, one word comes to mind: Awesome. The movie was simply awesome. The action scenes were the best I've seen in any recent movie, and the comedy was excellent. It seems that super-hero movies these days have become parodies of themselves. And for that reason the movies are even better. The audience and the actors are all in on the jokes together, and for that the audience feels delighted and laughs. To make the greatness of this movie more relatable, here is a list of things that are equal to the movie in excellence: 1. Donald Trump's commitment in a losing battle to prove Obama African 2. Obama's actually being American 3. Women's sports 4. Bashing Women's sports 5. Powerful shower-heads 6. shower-head 7. The lifespan of the Nintendo 64 8. The triple-chinned woman working at Burger King who wears a ""Grumpy"" shirt to let the customers know she is grumpy. The woman is, in fact, grumpy. You know what you're getting yourself into. 9. That dude's facial hair in the Hunger Games 10. Having your cake and eating it, too. And then going to brag to your friends about the cake that you got to eat but they didn't get to eat. And then they tell you that all of those carbs and sugar will go to your hips and butt. But you don't believe them. And you don't really care. Because that cake was excellent. I hope you could relate to at least one of these excellent things to see just how great this movie really is. It's like a mix between Fergie and Jesus. Not only will you enjoy this movie, but The Avengers will also solve many issues: 1. Relationship problems 2. Erectile dysfunction Those are actually all the problems this movie will solve.

2012-05-04,"You don't need me to tell you it's the culmination of a five-year plan that began with Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury taking Tony Stark aside at the end of the first ""Iron Man"" to tip him off as to the ""Avengers Initative."" There is a bigger picture, he told him -- and here it is: The be-all but not (they're hoping) the end-all of the current craze for CGI-enhanced super heroics. Interspersing flip one-liners with a host of larger-than-life characters and the usual flurry of fight-and-flight scenes, the film is never less than amusing. Still, it's never more than amusing either. Marvel Studios has made it a point of pride to diverge from the grim severity popularized in the DC / Warner Bros Batman films. The lightness is fun but it doesn't offer much of a foundation on which to build an epic. And let's face it, there's more than a whiff of opportunism about a project that pits a defrosted World War II hero, Captain America (Chris Evans), an inventor-industrialist, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the pagan lightning god, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), a scientist with anger- management issues, Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and SHIELD agents Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) against the Norse god of mischief, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and a legion of marauding aliens. In 3-D.Meet the boss of 'The Avengers' Chris Hemsworth is 'Thor' Chatting with the 'Iron Man 2' cast Still, Whedon (who shares a screenplay credit with Zak Penn) is a very sharp operator. He knows which buttons to press and where there's room for a little diversion. The improbability of this misfit coalition becomes the movie's most rewarding asset. Imagine the bristling egos of so many power players cooped up in the same room! The movie delivers the kind of pleasures usually reserved for fan fiction or playground stand-offs. Not surprisingly, Robert Downey Jr.'s flip, cynical Stark (Iron Man) gets a good measure of the movie's best lines, bouncing off Steve Rogers' (Captain America) boy scout idealism and Thor's guileless sledgehammer style (sometimes literally). Whedon also crafts a couple of choice scenes beautifully tailored for Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, a far more interesting character here than she appeared to be in ""Iron Man 2.""great action, 3d is the best up till now.

2012-05-29,"The Avengers is a superhero movie. There are 5 male superheroes and 1 female superhero. None of the characters are developed to a remotely human or 3-dimensional level. Although the film has many moments of witty dialogue and some entertaining action scenes, the plot feels as if it was made up in a few hours, and the villain, Loki, (The brother of Thor, one of the heroes) is one of the worst in recent action films. If you come to a movie wanting nothing but two hours of fighting and explosions, this film will exceed your expectations, but if you watch films for insights on human nature, to see well developed, interesting characters, and to see a carefully devised ingenious plot, this film may not be for you. However, it is fair to say that this is simply an action film, which is ""mindless entertainment"" and as ""mindless entertainment"" this film does succeed.

2012-05-17,"First of all, the cast, is that not alone to get you to the theater in the next 10 minutes to see it?If it's not, then how about all the records it has broken?Still not enough, how about one amazing thrill ride of a movie with lots of action and comedy as well as a GREAT storyline to go with it. The Avengers seriously has it all. The characters all jump back into action except this time they are assembling their powers to form a team that cannot be beat. The movie takes a little time to refresh you on any character development you may have forgotten and then it jumps right into the team building experience. It takes a while for these superheros to learn how to use their powers together to help one another, but once they learn how they are a force to be reckoned with. Once the action scenes start, it doesn't slow down and you have yourself a good hour or more of solid action of buildings blowing up, the hulk smashing everything, and so much more.Calling a movie the best movie ever is almost used too much that the saying loses credibility, but trust me on this, The Avengers seriously is the best movie yet!

2012-05-06,"After finally watching it, I see what the hype was all about. With a cornucopia of extraordinary and awesome special effects, The Avengers is truly the best-super hero film. An ensemble movie that intermingles four major Marvel characters into one awesome movie that has all what a comic fan would want--a fight scene between two of the most powerful and popular character, Iron Man and Thor, and the combined force of the Avengers shown in one movie. Not only does it rise in special effects and cinematography, the superhero extravaganza also has its characters well depicted with powerful the acting wit of Chris Hemsworth, Robert Downey, and the many others. Humor is also a major component that Whedon doesn't seem to forget, however, at times it seems a bit supererogatory. Looking at it from a general view, the film seems superior to any other Marvel film. However, its most obvious downside is the Hulk's lack of humanity which left him with almost nothing but a child playing around with a doll--although it was truly jocular. Overall, Marvel's the Avengers is a great film that will surely quench the thirst of many action-movie goers while having some dramatic and a few romantic scenes for other-genre of movie goers. Its truly a movie worth watching--the movie of 2012. Not only has the movie been praised for its special affects and acting, but it has also broken many records internationally.

2012-05-24,"Why ""The Avengers"" could easily become a huge success? I think even some of you could answer thiz question. Thiz movie is the culmination of Marvel's hard work over the past couple of years. The lucky guy who was appointed to direct thiz movie is Joss Whedon. The director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) initiates the Avengers initiative by assembling all the super humans to save the world from the powerful evil Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The storyline isn't as dynamic as I think it is, there's a time when the story is stuck and filled with unnecessary dialogue. The power of thiz movie obviously lies in its character interactions. Nick Fury is originally written as a white guy in the comic book but Samuel L. Jackson confidently steps in to play thiz character. Thiz isn't the first time thiz has happened. It reminds me when Michael Clarke Duncan portrayed the overweight crime boss Kingpin in Ben Affleck's ""Daredevil"" (2003) and I'm also so excited to see Laurence Fishburne as Clark Kent's boss Perry White in upcoming Superman's ""Man of Steel"" (2013). However, in thiz case, I didn't see Samuel L. Jackson became Nick Fury, instead it was Nick Fury became Samuel L. Jackson. But in the end, it's totally acceptable. Samuel L. Jackson is able to present a precise leadership aura to his Nick Fury's character. Once again, I have to remind you, what made thiz movie so interesting is when these superheroes gather around and interact with each other. We can see ""The Duo Chris"", Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth who successfully demonstrate their muscular bodies, just like in ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" (2011) and ""Thor"" (2011). Thiz is how superheroes should look like! The brand new figures in thiz movie are the master archer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and the elegant Agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders who is widely known in ""How I Met Your Mother"" {2005-present}). The other figures who have been introduced since ""Iron Man 2"" are the loyal Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) and the sexy heroine Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Surprisingly, Scarlett Johansson has a fairly large part in thiz movie. Wait a minute, on second thought, if you have Scar Jo in tight sexy latex suit, of course you will exploit it more. If we're talking about Iron Man, thiz is also one of the most interesting parts. It looks like Robert Downey Jr. have already fused into thiz Tony Stark's character so deep, he can represent thiz self-centered character very well without any problem. But in thiz movie, the one who really becomes a scene stealer is the giant green rage monster named Hulk! Once again, it's the Hulk's character, not exactly Dr. Bruce Banner or Mark Ruffalo but it's all of them in one. Some fresh and funny moments are obviously when Hulk is around. The most unfortunate thing is that they didn't bring up the original founding team such as Ant-Man and The Wasp into the movie. In the end, I confidently can say Marvel Comics seems to be one step ahead from its competitor DC Comics so far. Recently, thiz movie has ruled the box office chart and it turns out to be the earth's mightiest blockbuster movie. You know what that means, right? Oh yeah, the next Avengers movie will be coming soon. Maybe next time Marvel Studios will enrich their universe with the presence of other superheroes like Quicksilver, Black Panther, Vision, Doctor Strange, She-Hulk, Wolverine, even Spider-Man.

2012-05-04,"I saw the movie in 2D and loved it. The summer of 2012 begins with a BANG and the rest of the season movies ""have met their match"".Making the blockbuster ""The Avengers"" into a masterpiece of entertainment, at the time it was announced, seemed impossible for me to achieve with such a high level of efficiency and art. Not even the news of Joss Whedon directing (which I'm familiar with since his ""Buffy"" times""), not even the actors cast, not even the most recent trailers, could have prepared me for HOW WELL this movie is made. I already knew it was gonna be good, but I wasn't expecting it to be THIS GOOD!All the actors are at the top of their game. I won't stand out anyone, let's just say they're all excellent. From the main cast and even the secondary characters like agent Coulson or agent Hill. They're really good in this. And they all get their moments to shine, not only individually, but as a group. I didn't feel that one or the other got more ""screen time"" than the others, or that one was more important than the rest (speaking about the super-heroes). Each had its own relevance, contributed to the group, and we can clearly feel that when the team finally bonds, ""they're tough as nails"". This is a rare feat when dealing with ensemble casts. I'm wondering if any other movie has achieved this level of balance with such a high caliber group of actors.The script and the dialogs between characters, between the Avengers or between each one and Loki, are also spot-on. It's more than obvious the Whedon touch, who creates a tapestry of living words that sometimes goes beyond the ""comic book"" feel of the movie into something more (specifically the lines Loki delivers). And there's no shortage of humor: there are laugh out loud moments, funny moments that we weren't expecting, especially one very short scene between Thor and Hulk that takes but a blink of an eye. Oh, before I forget: if the trailers left you with a bitter taste of ""Transformers"" in your mouth, make no mistake: the action isn't, and by far, as robotic, tedious and soulless like in those movies.Regarding the technical aspects, there's not much to tell here. ILM delivers as usual and almost like no other. The art direction, the sound effects, the costumes are great. Alan Silvestri's score is more than competent.In short, ""The Avengers"" reaches without a problem the title of best movie of 2012 so far, and it will surely be in many top ten lists when the year is done. It is a landmark of cinema and in its particular genre that, although different from other movies of the same quality (""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight""), will absolutely not go unseen by lots and LOTS of people (fans and non-fans), and that we will remember like a ""Hulk smash to the head"": a 2h 20m punch that goes by so fast and that leaves me wanting much more.

2012-05-04,"I was waiting for this film and was not disappointed. My 10 rating does not place it in the same class as ""The Godfather"", ""Citizen Kane"" et al. This is the ""Citizen Kane"" of superhero movies.When I was a kid, my friend and I used to argue about which was better: Marvel or D.C. I used to complain that the Avengers fought amongst each other too much, instead of the ""Justice League of America"" who fought their foes more harmoniously. I think the former is probably more realistic, since all these egos on one team cannot work in complete harmony. There is a good scene where they are all bickering and challenging each other.This film is not only action-packed, but there are some very funny scenes--more funny than any of today's supposed ""comedies"". The Hulk has many comic moments which is ironic since the two ""Hulk"" films were somewhat disappointing.Robert Downey Jr. also has many good lines, better than in ""Iron Man 2"".This is a wonderfully entertaining film, which is a rarity these days. I highly recommend seeing this film. Also, while there are some violent scenes, it is more viewable for the kids than ""The Dark Knight"".My friend was right all along, the Marvel characters are much more exciting as a team than their D.C. counterparts, although I would love to see a live-action ""Justice League of America"".",10.0,2012-05,Friday,"10:0.07, about:0.05, action:0.08, all:0.10, along:0.09, also:0.11, although:0.09, america:0.10, and:0.08, any:0.06, are:0.16, as:0.07, avengers:0.04, better:0.12, but:0.03, characters:0.04, comic:0.06, dark:0.08, disappointed:0.09, does:0.06, downey:0.06, each:0.12, entertaining:0.08, exciting:0.09, film:0.17, films:0.06, for:0.07, funny:0.15, good:0.09, has:0.09, highly:0.09, hulk:0.08, in:0.09, instead:0.10, iron:0.05, is:0.23, it:0.06, jr:0.06, knight:0.08, lines:0.09, love:0.07, man:0.04, many:0.12, marvel:0.09, moments:0.08, more:0.24, movies:0.05, much:0.11, my:0.14, not:0.11, of:0.13, on:0.04, one:0.04, only:0.06, or:0.05, other:0.10, packed:0.09, place:0.09, probably:0.08, rating:0.09, recommend:0.09, right:0.07, robert:0.06, same:0.07, scene:0.07, scenes:0.12, see:0.05, seeing:0.08, since:0.15, some:0.10, superhero:0.05, team:0.13, than:0.21, that:0.03, the:0.28, their:0.10, there:0.14, these:0.12, they:0.04, think:0.06, this:0.14, to:0.08, too:0.06, two:0.07, used:0.19, very:0.05, was:0.17, were:0.05, when:0.05, where:0.07, which:0.17, while:0.07, who:0.05, work:0.07, would:0.05"
2012-05-19,"So here we are now. After years of development and a few film establishing the main characters, we get to see a team of superheroes being, well, a superhero super group. My initial response was of dread as I could not see it working well but to my surprise it is one of the most entertaining films of the year.With Earth being under attack from dastardly villain Loki and his evil plot to rule Earth and its inhabitants, it is down to Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) to pull together his group of superheroes to save the human race. Luckily for those of you who have seen all the individual films, the need for each characters origin and development is unnecessary as they have been fully established in their own stories.The film does start off very well and establishes a plot (although very well worn) about an attempt by Loki (main villain from Thor), to take a mysterious cube (the Tesseract) which harnesses a power that can open a teleport/wormhole to allow an alien army which he commands to take over the world. Even with this simplistic and over familiar storyline the film has many entertaining moments and is littered with loads of Whedons trademark witty one liners.The one truly great thing about this film is how well it manages all the superheroes characters and never does one character feel like it's just a film about them with a few extra superheroes tagging along. Each one of them have a similar amount of screen time and a specific purpose which drives the plot forward. Another thing is that the guy behind the film (Whedon) knows his material and creates a loving, authentic and workable story which means each character never feels like a bit character. A very balanced juggling act which allows the stars to shine and show their unique personalities.The only minor criticism I would give is the over hype that this picture has garnered by many and judging by it's box office record breaking takings, people are going in their droves to see what all the fuss is about. Don't get me wrong, the film is good but not an all time classic. The plot is nothing new, and the alien invasion at the climax of the film is a bit reminiscent of Transformers 3, and a team that doesn't get on but eventually stand together and realize a common enemy, all very clichéd.",8.0,2012-05,Saturday,"about:0.13, after:0.04, alien:0.11, all:0.11, along:0.06, although:0.05, amount:0.06, an:0.08, and:0.26, another:0.05, are:0.05, army:0.05, as:0.05, at:0.03, been:0.04, being:0.08, bit:0.10, but:0.06, by:0.09, can:0.03, character:0.10, characters:0.08, could:0.04, development:0.11, does:0.08, doesn:0.05, don:0.04, down:0.05, each:0.11, earth:0.09, entertaining:0.09, even:0.03, evil:0.05, feel:0.05, feels:0.06, few:0.09, film:0.21, films:0.08, for:0.04, from:0.05, fury:0.04, get:0.11, give:0.05, going:0.04, good:0.03, great:0.03, group:0.11, guy:0.05, has:0.06, have:0.07, he:0.03, here:0.04, his:0.10, how:0.04, hype:0.06, in:0.04, individual:0.06, is:0.19, it:0.10, its:0.04, jackson:0.05, just:0.03, like:0.05, loki:0.06, main:0.10, many:0.08, me:0.03, moments:0.05, most:0.04, my:0.06, need:0.05, never:0.08, new:0.04, nick:0.04, not:0.05, nothing:0.05, now:0.04, of:0.20, off:0.04, on:0.03, one:0.12, only:0.03, over:0.12, own:0.05, people:0.04, plot:0.16, power:0.06, samuel:0.05, save:0.06, screen:0.04, see:0.09, seen:0.04, show:0.05, so:0.03, stand:0.06, stars:0.06, start:0.05, story:0.03, storyline:0.06, super:0.04, superhero:0.03, superheroes:0.16, take:0.09, team:0.08, tesseract:0.06, that:0.08, the:0.38, their:0.09, them:0.07, they:0.03, thing:0.09, this:0.05, thor:0.03, those:0.04, time:0.06, to:0.19, together:0.07, transformers:0.06, truly:0.06, very:0.13, villain:0.09, was:0.02, we:0.07, well:0.15, what:0.03, whedon:0.03, which:0.17, who:0.03, with:0.09, witty:0.06, world:0.04, would:0.03, wrong:0.06, year:0.05, years:0.05, you:0.02"
2012-05-23,"There's something unique about this movie. It speeds through a complex back story (many back stories actually) and yet makes it work through excellent dialog and even more incredible and often subtle acting. It adds more action than a Michael Bay film but does it right by investing the audience beforehand, not to mention how much better the actual action is. It assembles characters with very uneven powers but manages to make them all shine.Basically it's excellent. Everything's good in it. But I'll just state the reasons you should see it. The dialog and character interaction is AMAZING. The fight choreography is unrivaled. The comedy is just as incredible as the action and they often intersect beautifully. The cast is excellent. The villain makes the world conquering routine seem fresh (which is not easy to do). The stakes are high but at the same time it's a personal battle. Each of the characters has a different reason for being there and the movie gives them all importance which is one of the most difficult things about ensembles like this. There are even more subtle story arcs that expand the viewers interest in the heroes personalities given them depth while foreshadowing directions for future films in this franchise.There are a lot of things this movie had to overcome that it did beautifully. For one thing it was the first movie that I know of that attempted to build off of other stand-alone films. It connects them quite well. Then it had to survive the editing room. Apparently over an hour of footage was left out (most probably at the request of the studio). The pacing is still great. It had to live up to fans expectations. Don't know about other fans but I've been collecting comics since I was 8 and this movie blew my mind. Joss Whedon's greatest achievement had to be to introduce these characters to each other, create group tensions and then quickly have them learn to work together. If you pay attention you can see them learn each others rhythms and adapt to each others styles slowly as the movie progresses.I especially enjoyed Mark Ruffalo. I was skeptical about this casting choice (even though I really liked him in Shutter Island). I have to say he plays the hulk much more enjoyably than any previous incarnation. While others have always portrayed him in a more cliché'd ""Jeckyl and Hyde"" style, he plays him with his own technique. He attempts the character of Bruce Banner like a person who's learnt to overcome a crippling addiction/flaw, similar to what a lot of recovering rageaholics (real thing) go through. But the world and Loki seem to be begging him to release ""the other guy"". You truly feel for once, that the Hulk and Bruce Banner are the same person but in very different states of mind, which is how it's supposed to be. He also has a sense of humour about his condition making him more likable than the usual whiny Bruce Banners. His Hulk is just the most amazing character. When the big fight scene happens he does not disappoint.The cinema experience is great. The movie is 2 and a half hours long but just flies by.What I personally most enjoyed about the movie is that it wasn't shy about being a comic book movie. In fact it celebrated the comic book over the top attitude with everyone and not just fans. There was no humor in this that was an in joke that only fans would get. It pokes fun and shows flaws in its heroes. It makes the hero villain struggle very enjoyable.Basically this is the movie I've wanted since I was a kid. It's big and it's smart but also didn't have to go to dark and gritty story lines like a lot of other comic book movies (which often feels out of place and humourless to me).A definite must-see.",10.0,2012-05,Wednesday,"about:0.15, acting:0.03, action:0.05, actually:0.03, all:0.03, also:0.05, always:0.03, amazing:0.06, an:0.04, and:0.20, any:0.03, are:0.07, as:0.05, at:0.04, audience:0.04, back:0.06, banner:0.06, battle:0.03, be:0.05, been:0.02, being:0.06, better:0.03, big:0.05, book:0.09, bruce:0.09, but:0.13, by:0.04, can:0.02, cast:0.03, character:0.07, characters:0.06, cinema:0.04, comedy:0.04, comic:0.07, comics:0.03, dark:0.03, depth:0.04, did:0.03, didn:0.03, different:0.07, do:0.03, does:0.05, don:0.02, each:0.10, enjoyed:0.07, especially:0.03, even:0.07, everyone:0.03, everything:0.03, excellent:0.11, expectations:0.04, experience:0.04, fact:0.04, fans:0.13, feel:0.03, feels:0.04, fight:0.06, film:0.02, films:0.05, first:0.02, for:0.06, franchise:0.04, fun:0.03, get:0.02, given:0.04, go:0.05, good:0.02, great:0.04, greatest:0.04, group:0.04, guy:0.04, had:0.09, half:0.04, has:0.04, have:0.07, he:0.11, hero:0.03, heroes:0.05, high:0.03, him:0.15, his:0.07, hour:0.04, hours:0.04, how:0.05, hulk:0.05, humor:0.03, humour:0.04, if:0.02, in:0.13, incredible:0.06, is:0.17, it:0.25, its:0.03, joss:0.02, just:0.09, know:0.06, left:0.04, like:0.05, liked:0.04, lines:0.04, ll:0.04, loki:0.02, long:0.03, lot:0.08, make:0.03, makes:0.09, making:0.03, many:0.03, mark:0.03, me:0.02, mind:0.07, more:0.12, most:0.10, movie:0.13, movies:0.02, much:0.04, must:0.03, my:0.02, no:0.02, not:0.06, of:0.15, off:0.03, once:0.04, one:0.03, only:0.02, other:0.11, others:0.11, out:0.04, over:0.05, own:0.03, place:0.04, powers:0.04, previous:0.03, probably:0.04, quite:0.03, real:0.04, really:0.02, reason:0.04, right:0.03, ruffalo:0.03, same:0.06, say:0.03, scene:0.03, see:0.06, seem:0.08, sense:0.04, should:0.03, since:0.07, something:0.03, stand:0.04, still:0.03, story:0.06, than:0.07, that:0.11, the:0.42, them:0.13, then:0.06, there:0.10, these:0.03, they:0.02, thing:0.06, things:0.07, this:0.10, though:0.03, through:0.10, time:0.02, to:0.25, together:0.02, top:0.03, truly:0.04, up:0.02, ve:0.06, very:0.07, villain:0.06, was:0.10, wasn:0.04, well:0.02, what:0.04, whedon:0.02, when:0.02, which:0.09, while:0.06, who:0.02, with:0.04, work:0.06, world:0.06, would:0.02, yet:0.04, you:0.07"

2012-05-05,"If you're looking for a fun time at the movies this weekend, look no further. There was just a tremendous amount of hype for the film (I mean I couldn't go anywhere or do anything without seeing some sort of ad). But I'm very happy to say, they met my high expectations and then some. Firstly, the bad stuff. The first half of the film is a bit too slowly paced. I felt Whedon spent a bit too much time on ramp up and origin story (especially when each of the important characters had their own origin film for that purpose). Maybe he felt the need to do so because not everyone would've seen the other films. But as someone who made the time to see them, I felt this was unnecessary. Once things picked up in the second half, it was definitely a worth the wait. There's quite a lot lot to love here. There are some fantastic action sequences and battles (pretty much the whole second half). A few moments where you just say ""that was #$@&* awesome!"". A surprisingly frequent number of laugh out loud moments. My crowd even had a few spontaneous outbursts of clapping as well. The script was very cleverly written and the story was engaging (albeit very simple). There's something for everyone here. It's amazing the film was almost 2.5 hours long, because it didn't feel like it dragged (slowly paced start withstanding). And I felt that Whedon did a great job at allowing each character adequate screen time for you to be connected to them. This is a rare feet in films where there are so many characters as it's very hard to do, yet Whedon handled this perfectly. I didn't feel there was a single character who didn't belong or was just filler (see the X-Men films). Every character was necessary, every character played a pivotal role, every character meant something. Again, can't say enough of how much I appreciated this. I loved the performances. Robert Downey Jr. was once again brilliant as Iron Man (and really is the most interesting character in the film, he steals virtually every scene he's in). Sam Jackson puts in a stellar turn once again as Nick Fury. Chris Hemworth and Mark Ruffalo were on point as well. But the surprise for me was Chris Evans as Captain America. I really was disappointed in last summer's Captain America and I felt he was miscast because he didn't feel as authoritative as I expected Captain America to be (and not as grizzled or mature). But he was clearly much better here as I actually believed him this time around than in the origin film. Combined with the other performances, I really felt this lifted the film. Be sure to stick around after the credits (although really, you should have this figured out by now, it's a Marvel staple). There's not one, but two extra scenes to be seen (the 2nd of which is quite hilarious). While it's not at the level of The Dark Knight, it's pretty damn good as a ""stuff gonna blow up"" summer film. It's just a great way to start off the summer movie season. Hopefully the rest of the summer lives up this.Head out to your nearest multiplex, get your popcorn ready and enjoy this action gem!For more of my reviews and general movie discussion, check out my blog: http://andretms.blogspot.ca/",8.0,2012-05,Saturday,"action:0.04, actually:0.04, after:0.03, again:0.10, almost:0.04, although:0.04, amazing:0.03, america:0.07, amount:0.05, and:0.13, anything:0.04, are:0.04, around:0.08, as:0.21, at:0.06, awesome:0.03, bad:0.03, be:0.07, because:0.08, better:0.03, bit:0.07, brilliant:0.04, but:0.08, by:0.02, can:0.02, captain:0.07, character:0.15, characters:0.04, chris:0.07, couldn:0.04, credits:0.04, dark:0.04, definitely:0.04, did:0.03, didn:0.13, disappointed:0.04, do:0.08, downey:0.03, each:0.05, enjoy:0.04, enough:0.03, especially:0.04, evans:0.03, even:0.03, every:0.12, everyone:0.07, expectations:0.04, expected:0.04, fantastic:0.04, feel:0.10, felt:0.23, few:0.07, film:0.16, films:0.08, first:0.03, for:0.11, fun:0.03, fury:0.03, get:0.03, go:0.03, good:0.02, great:0.04, had:0.05, half:0.12, hard:0.04, have:0.02, he:0.14, here:0.10, high:0.04, him:0.03, hours:0.04, how:0.03, hype:0.04, if:0.02, in:0.10, interesting:0.04, iron:0.02, is:0.05, it:0.12, jackson:0.03, job:0.03, jr:0.03, just:0.08, knight:0.04, last:0.04, like:0.02, long:0.03, look:0.04, looking:0.04, lot:0.06, love:0.03, loved:0.04, made:0.03, man:0.02, many:0.03, mark:0.03, marvel:0.02, maybe:0.04, me:0.02, moments:0.07, more:0.02, most:0.03, movie:0.03, movies:0.02, much:0.10, my:0.09, need:0.04, nick:0.03, no:0.03, not:0.07, now:0.03, of:0.14, off:0.03, on:0.04, once:0.12, one:0.02, or:0.07, other:0.05, out:0.09, own:0.03, perfectly:0.04, performances:0.09, played:0.04, point:0.04, pretty:0.07, quite:0.07, re:0.04, really:0.09, rest:0.04, reviews:0.04, robert:0.03, role:0.04, ruffalo:0.03, say:0.09, scene:0.03, scenes:0.03, screen:0.03, script:0.04, second:0.08, see:0.04, seeing:0.04, seen:0.06, sequences:0.04, should:0.03, simple:0.04, single:0.04, so:0.04, some:0.07, something:0.07, start:0.08, story:0.05, stuff:0.09, summer:0.18, sure:0.04, than:0.02, that:0.04, the:0.35, their:0.02, them:0.05, then:0.03, there:0.15, they:0.02, things:0.04, this:0.13, time:0.11, to:0.15, too:0.06, two:0.03, up:0.09, ve:0.03, very:0.10, wait:0.04, was:0.24, way:0.03, well:0.04, were:0.02, whedon:0.08, when:0.02, where:0.06, which:0.03, while:0.03, who:0.05, whole:0.04, with:0.02, without:0.03, worth:0.04, would:0.02, written:0.04, yet:0.04, you:0.07, your:0.06"

The concept of getting our bad guy from out of space, the powers of whose almost are like supernatural, is totally unimpressive.All in all, I would say only kids may enjoy this movie.I am a big fan of Marvel comics and I thoroughly enjoyed the Spidermans, the Iron mans etc...

I didn't really like super hero movies until I saw The Avengers, but I came out of the theater screaming because of how awesome it was. I wanted to tell the world how great it is and still do and this is the best way. For every epic moment there is something hilarious to follow it up. I came out with the thought that every one of the super heroes was a total bada** and Samuel L. Jackson is awesome too he gets s*** done. I read some of the bad reviews and most say that there is no real emotion but if you actually pay attention you can see small things that make sense and relate to history and stuff.

2013-06-23,"This movie is an epic adventure for everyone. If you've been waiting for a bunch of super heroes in one movie your dream has come true. I was really impressed with the action in this movie, i was also impressed with the background music as well. The story to this movie was the way it should be and making Loki the villain in this movie was the perfect choice. This has got to be one of the best action movies in history. It was also pretty hilarious watching all the reactions the hulk made to all the characters,especially when he grabbed Loki and tossed him like a rag doll.I think iron man was the most exciting thing about this movie. If you watch the extra ending of the movie you will find out that Thanos might appear in the avengers 2 that is coming out in 2015.

2012-05-19,"The movie is vastly entertaining. The Action scenes are amazing and satisfying. Nobody is short changed when it comes to the fighting or action sequences. I felt as if there was not a single bad performance. Each of the characters brought their personality (from their respective movie) to the table. Marc Ruffalo...brilliant and a welcome addition and so much better than the last Hulk - Edward Norton. When Mark Ruffalo was first announced to play Bruce Banner, i didn't know what to think of it. I knew that he's a good actor. All he needs is the right director to get the needed on-screen character out of him. I really hope they make an Incredible Hulk movie sequel starring Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner.Joss Whedon did one hell of a Job directing and writing this original script... the end title sequence is like 20,000 names long... wow.

2012-11-18,"Hype was filled in the air as this star-filled, action packed, superhero movie was about to come to U.S. theaters. In my opinion, all of the hype was delightfully fulfilled after its release. The Avengers smashed the box office and grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide becoming the third highest-grossing film of all time.Let's first take a look at this all-star cast. Robert Downey, Jr. plays a billionaire playboy philanthropist named Tony Stark (Iron Man). This is the second best performance in a superhero type movie that I have ever seen; next to Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. He brings a lot of wit and charisma to the film which is a big part why it became as successful as it was. Chris Hemsworth plays Thor, who is the crown prince of Asgard. His Spartan-like appearance and acting skills is the reason why I think Chris was the perfect choice to play Thor. My favorite part is when Thor fought with Captain America (due to Captain America being chosen as the leader) because it was so unexpected. Speaking of Captain America (Steve Rogers), he is played by Chris Evans whose physic is perfect for this role. His character is adequately developed throughout the movie. Mark Ruffalo's acting as the Hulk (Dr. Bruce Banner) I thought was very good. Joss Whedon got great use out of the hulk for the limited time he was in there. The epic battle with Loki at the end when the hulk smashes Loki was a highlight of the film. Whedon use of the hulk's strength is brilliant and even sometimes humorous. Scarlett Johansson plays Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff) in the film. Her charm and sexy looks bode well with the character. Being a woman in superhero movie seems like it would be a tough challenge, but she hit the nail on the coffin. My favorite scene with her is when she is being violently interrogated by a trio of gangsters. The gangsters reveal their master plan before Johansson breaks out of the chair and takes down all three men. This scene showed her amazing acrobatic ability.Jeremy Renner plays Hawkeye, a very skillful marksman. He seemed to play this role very confidently and was almost flawless throughout the movie.For every superhero movie, there's always a villain. The villain in The Avengers is named Loki and is played by Tom Hiddleston. In my opinion his acting is superb. He plays the character of a very menacing and mad man.The minor characters (Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill, and Stellan Skarsgard as Dr. Erik Selvig) are all decent at their respected roles. Although, I think Samuel L. Jackson should have had more airtime as the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. The plot unfolds very quickly in this action-packed movie. Without spoiling the movie, I will access the basic plot structure. Nick Furry, who is the leader of the peacekeeping agency known as S.H.I.E.L.D, and Black Widow  have to assemble a special group to combat Thor's evil brother Loki after he takes the cosmic cube and uses his scepter to brainwash Dr. Selvig and multiple agents, including Hawkeye in order to help him in his getaway. The heroes have a hard time working together but eventually learn how to. Bruce Banner (Hulk) plays an important role because he helps track down the artifact's gamma signals. The plot is developed very nicely and is exactly what a superhero movie should be.The graphics and for this film is superb to say the least, especially on blue ray. The fact that most of the filming for this movie was actually filmed in a big city (mostly New York and Cleveland), rather than a made up Hollywood set, gives it a feeling of realism and an illusion that the viewer is actually in the movie. The special effects are second to none in The Avengers. The huge explosions, giant hole opening up in the air, Hawkeye falling out of the sky and shooting his arrow, and hulk smashing Loki are just a few of many excellent examples of amazing special effects.Overall, I would give this film two thumbs up. The flawless acting, explosive plot, superb graphics, and excellent special effects all add up to a perfect superhero movie. I would recommend this movie to any person who loves action-packed, superhero films.",10.0,2012-11,Sunday,"about:0.02, acting:0.11, action:0.05, actually:0.06, after:0.05, all:0.08, almost:0.03, although:0.03, always:0.03, amazing:0.05, america:0.06, an:0.03, and:0.20, any:0.02, are:0.05, as:0.16, assemble:0.03, at:0.05, avengers:0.04, banner:0.05, battle:0.03, be:0.03, because:0.05, before:0.03, being:0.08, best:0.02, big:0.05, black:0.05, brilliant:0.04, brings:0.04, brother:0.03, bruce:0.06, but:0.03, by:0.06, captain:0.06, cast:0.03, character:0.06, characters:0.02, chris:0.08, come:0.03, dark:0.03, director:0.03, down:0.06, downey:0.02, effects:0.07, end:0.03, epic:0.03, especially:0.03, evans:0.03, even:0.02, ever:0.02, every:0.02, evil:0.03, excellent:0.07, fact:0.03, favorite:0.06, few:0.03, film:0.10, films:0.02, first:0.02, for:0.06, fury:0.03, give:0.03, good:0.02, got:0.03, great:0.02, group:0.03, had:0.02, hard:0.03, have:0.06, hawkeye:0.07, he:0.13, help:0.04, hemsworth:0.03, her:0.10, heroes:0.02, hiddleston:0.03, him:0.03, his:0.12, hollywood:0.04, how:0.02, huge:0.03, hulk:0.10, hype:0.07, in:0.18, iron:0.02, is:0.21, it:0.05, its:0.02, jackson:0.06, jeremy:0.03, johansson:0.06, joss:0.02, jr:0.02, just:0.02, knight:0.03, least:0.03, let:0.03, like:0.03, loki:0.10, look:0.03, looks:0.04, lot:0.03, made:0.02, man:0.03, many:0.02, mark:0.02, more:0.02, most:0.02, movie:0.15, my:0.07, new:0.03, next:0.03, nick:0.05, of:0.19, on:0.03, opinion:0.07, out:0.05, over:0.02, overall:0.03, packed:0.10, part:0.06, perfect:0.08, performance:0.04, play:0.07, played:0.07, plot:0.10, rather:0.04, reason:0.04, recommend:0.03, renner:0.03, robert:0.02, role:0.10, ruffalo:0.02, samuel:0.06, say:0.02, scarlett:0.03, scene:0.06, second:0.07, seemed:0.04, seems:0.03, seen:0.02, set:0.03, she:0.07, should:0.05, so:0.02, special:0.10, star:0.07, stark:0.03, superhero:0.14, take:0.03, takes:0.07, than:0.02, that:0.04, the:0.53, their:0.04, there:0.04, think:0.05, this:0.12, thor:0.07, thought:0.03, throughout:0.07, time:0.05, to:0.17, together:0.02, tom:0.03, tony:0.03, two:0.03, up:0.08, very:0.12, villain:0.05, was:0.15, well:0.02, what:0.02, whedon:0.04, when:0.06, which:0.02, who:0.06, why:0.06, widow:0.05, will:0.02, with:0.05, without:0.03, would:0.06, york:0.04"

2012-05-04,"Everybody seems to like this film. I don't. I respect everyone's opinion, but I must say I'm a little puzzled by the public response to what I consider to be just an average popcorn movie. The storyline is weak, but everyone seems to agree that it isn't the most important element of the film. Its major points are: 1) the action; 2) the relationships between the characters. With regard to the action scenes, I felt nothing but indifference. The main reason is that I can't stand CGI. Everything seems flat and unreal. And The Avengers is a CGI fest. If you like that sort of thing, you'll love it. If you are an old-school action movie lover, you'll probably be bored. As for the relationships between the main characters, I was even more disappointed. Dialogues in the film are just an endless series of supposedly funny jokes. The entire movie plays as very loud and expensive comedy. I can't stand Robert Downey, Jr anymore. Someone had said that he is Tony Stark, but the fact is that Tony Stark is Robert Downey Jr. He's not playing a character, he's just being a wise-ass. Actually, he does it in every movie he's in. It's unbearable. The other characters are equally bland, except for Tom Hiddleston's Loki (this man's a great actor) and maybe Mark Ruffalo's David Banner/Hulk.

It has everything you would want; Great action, good acting, superb special-effects and extremely good interaction between the characters. I won't give anything away but the interaction between The Hulk and Thor is hilarious, especially near to the end of the film. Chris Evans is great as Captain America, Mark Ruffalo is good as the calm Hulk, Chris Hemsworth is good as Thor yet again, the rest are decent but the star of the characters is Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark. He is such a smart, witty, funny character and he makes the film a lot more interesting. My only fault with acting is that Loki is not ""bad enough"".

I have dreamed of seeing Captain America, Thor and the Hulk on the same screen doing what they do best and the The Avengers didn't let me down. It is by far the most well made super hero movie I have been able to watch. First don't get me wrong I like the Dark Knight series but with the mixture of CG animation and live action flowing so well together I had a hard time figuring out what wasn't real in the scene. That's what I want to see, a movie where I can't see exactly what is real and what's fake. The Avengers lived up to it's hype.The acting within the Avengers was couldn't have been called anything but perfect. With the great one liners and the impressive skill each line is delivered I couldn't have expected it to be better. I even enjoyed watching Samuel L. Jackson in this film and that is something very rare for me. With the acting my biggest fear was each character fighting for the screen time and I didn't get that from any of them.

2012-05-05,"In 2008, Marvel Studios gave us the first film adaptation of it's super hero Iron Man, with the promise of big things to come. The film was an astounding success, proving that Batman wasn't the only hero that can have a good movie. What followed was four more films, The Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America, all critical and financial successes, and all leading up to one massive blowout known as The Avengers. Culminating all five films into one massive adventure was a seemingly impossible task, however writer/director Joss Whedon somehow, against all odds, pulled it off in a big way.It's something that has never been done before in film. Taking these characters, who have proved they are strong enough to carry a film by themselves, and putting them all together in one over-arching continuity. The problems that could arise from this concept are endless, and yet this films works. Not only does it work, it's so brilliantly pieced together that it is destined to become the greatest super hero movie ever made.Joss Whedon, of Firefly and Buffy fame, is no stranger to creating stories featuring ensemble casts. The contrasting personalities of the team play a large role, and Whedon explores this with astounding fervor. This is a character study as much as an action film, and the witty dialogue Whedon brings to the table only enhances the personalities of these extraordinary individuals. The banter between the heroes during lulls in the action is just as engaging as the mind-blowing action itself.And the action will blow your mind. The main reason most people want to go see this film, is to see The Avengers kick some ass, and there is no shortage of ass-kickery happening in this film. Although The Hulk steals most of the jaw-dropping moments, even the lower tier characters of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) get just as much screen time, and each have their own ""wow"" moments.One thing that is an absolute must when having such an over-powered team like this, is having a worthy adversary. Tom Hiddleston's character of Loki plays the perfect villain, and what better an adversary than a crazed God and his army? When it was first revealed that Loki was the film's antagonist, the initial fear was that we already saw Thor defeat Loki in his own movie, so why is there a need for The Avengers to be involved, when we already know Thor can beat him single handedly? Fortunately, this and all the other fanboy and critic's questions are addressed and taken into consideration.Since I was a child, I have always talked about the prospect of an Avengers movie, and it looked so unattainable that it seemed like it would forever remain just a 12 year old's dream. Having previously dreamt of a G.I. Joe movie, it comes as no surprise when The Avengers was announced, I was left with cautious optimism. Much to my delight, it seems that Joss Whedon was somehow able to look into my soul and produce the best comic book movie ever made.

2012-05-04,"First, I need to say I really like this type of movies, super heroes, sci-fi, fantasy stuff, for me, this is entertainment. Not everyone fills the same, so it's important to consider this point before you can think I can be over-reacting. Now the movie, from all I've seen, this was the one that really made it full, you laugh, you get angry, and you even get sad, but it's only because the movie ended! Spider-Man is also one of my favorites, just now surpassed by this one. The story from Spider-Man is more linear, so here it might get a point, but the thing is, this is fantasy from the comics coming true on the screen, like back then we were a child, I couldn't have all the numbers so, I'm not much into the accuracy.

2012-05-16,"Joss Whedon, who has made a name in television, namely for ANGEL (tv, 1999-2004), FIREFLY (tv, 2002-2003), and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (tv, 1996-2003), as well as having written the screenplays of TOY STORY (1995), ALIEN: RESURRECTION (1997), TITAN A.E. (2000), and the concurrently showing CABIN IN THE WOODS (2012), establishes himself as a full-fledged director with a big bang. THE AVENGERS features an array of box office stars, fantastic special effects and tightly-directed action scenes, with a sprinkling of dramatic moments and comedic relief (mostly from Robert Downey Jr's wisecracks and Clark Gregg's gay-like adulation of Chris Evans' character). The major players (Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Incredible Hulk) are introduced briefly but markingly, and from the onset you know Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) has his hands full, bringing together this group of superheroes with flamboyantly clashing personalities. The tesseract, a cosmic cube of debatable origins that has unlimited powers, has been stolen, and Fury assembles the Avengers to retrieve this cube. Villainy is provided deliciously by Tom Hiddleston as Loki, and Gwyneth Paltrow is a welcome addition (from Downey's IRON MAN films) -- as well as Colbie Smulders, making her Marvel film debut as Agent Maria Hill. Only the last third of the film loses steam, with one vaguely wondering why the robots-attack- city scenario is oddly familiar (TRANSFORMERS, anyone?). An ambiguous ending also mars the otherwise energetic proceedings, with Thor accosting his brother Loki back to Asgard. Alan Silvestri's vivid musical score adds to the kinetic frenzy, and Seamus McGarvey's cinematography is impressive. Whedon has crafted a well-crafted action movie with much visceral excitement and an earnest cast.",9.0,2012-05,Wednesday,"2012:0.09, action:0.08, agent:0.11, alien:0.09, also:0.06, america:0.05, an:0.14, and:0.27, anyone:0.09, are:0.04, as:0.27, avengers:0.08, back:0.08, been:0.06, big:0.07, black:0.06, brother:0.09, but:0.03, by:0.05, captain:0.05, cast:0.07, character:0.05, chris:0.07, director:0.07, downey:0.12, effects:0.06, evans:0.08, fantastic:0.08, film:0.09, films:0.06, for:0.03, from:0.14, full:0.18, fury:0.14, group:0.09, has:0.24, having:0.09, hawkeye:0.07, her:0.09, hiddleston:0.08, his:0.11, hulk:0.04, impressive:0.11, in:0.06, incredible:0.08, iron:0.10, is:0.12, jackson:0.08, joss:0.06, jr:0.06, know:0.07, last:0.08, like:0.04, loki:0.11, made:0.06, making:0.08, man:0.09, marvel:0.05, moments:0.08, movie:0.03, much:0.06, nick:0.07, of:0.20, one:0.04, only:0.06, powers:0.10, robert:0.06, samuel:0.08, scenes:0.06, special:0.07, stars:0.10, story:0.05, superheroes:0.07, tesseract:0.10, that:0.03, the:0.37, this:0.06, thor:0.10, to:0.09, together:0.06, tom:0.07, transformers:0.10, well:0.15, whedon:0.12, who:0.05, why:0.08, widow:0.06, with:0.21, written:0.10, you:0.04"
2012-04-28,"I was hoping that this film would be just as exciting and involving as the Super Hero films I have seen over the last 12 years - X-Men, X2, Spiderman 1 & 2, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Iron Man - I could watch them and really enjoy them time and time again - but this one - it just didn't do it for me! I'm not sure why, but even with the 3D effect - to be honest, didn't make much difference, until the final battle sequence - but even then it was few and far between! I think this film was too loud and infantile and tried too hard to sound sophisticated and too much technical talk - was that supposed to sound impressive?

This movie definitely keeps the style of Iron Man : lots of funny lines, excitement, quick peace line and mouth-dropping high-technology weapons Well-written dialogue loaded with entertainment, message and clue. Some lines make you laugh spontaneously , but when you think them twice will reveal the value of each character.(E.g A:We need a plan of attack B: I got a plan, ATTACK!)The plot is very 3D ! It well-depicted the role, character and struggle of each hero to make you hardly dispense anyone of them in the movie.

2012-04-28,"Before the Avengers assembled we've had 2 Iron Man, 2 Hulk, 1 Thor & 1 Captain America movies. Black Widow was seen in Iron Man 2 and Hawk Eye makes a first time appearance in this one. If you do the math it is pretty clear that to get The Avengers right the director has to get Hulk and Iron Man right. Iron Man is safe in the good command of Robert Downey Jr. but Hulk was the only character that never peaked in spite of two actors (Eric Bana & Edward Norton) trying to nail it in two different movies. For me the biggest triumph of The Avengers is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/ The Hulk. He is the best Hulk yet.Whats it about? For those who have not followed the series, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) lands up on earth searching for a cube that will help him rule the earth. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) has to stop him so he assembles Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), The Hulk (Mark Rufalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johanson), Hawk Eye (Jeremy Renner), Captain America (Steve Rogers) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) to stop Loki. How is it? Paisa vasool entertainment.My Take Like I mentioned above Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/ The Hulk is the bestest part of the movie. You have to be patient enough for The Hulk to appear. His entry is almost after an hour but Mark Ruffalo prepares the perfect build up as Bruce Banner with his restrained and almost vulnerable portrayal of a character struggling with his condition. The second best thing is the humor. Joss Whedon gives all the characters some really witty lines to deliver. Since most part is about the Avengers coming together the humor helps in keeping the audience engaged especially those who are not well versed with the back stories of each individual superhero. Out of the all the superheroes I was only interested in Robert Downey Jr and Mark Rufalo. The rest were great supporting actors at their best. The icing on the cake is the last 30 mins when the film peaks as a special effects loaded summer blockbuster movie. If you look at director Joss Whedons filmography you'll wonder what made the studios trust him with a rumored 220 million dollar budget film. Now, that is the story I am very interested in knowing! He is the only guy I know who has taken a giant leap from T.V to the big screen. Word of mouth The Avengers is an ultimate 2 super hero (The Hulk and Iron Man) movie with a fantastic supporting cast of 4 (Black Widow, Hawk Eye, Thor and Captain America). Rating - **** (Very Good) Ticket Meter Worth any amount of moneyP.S. If you have it playing in an Imax theatre drop everything and make an effort to watch it there.

2012-11-08,"The movie Avengers is a good movie because of the the marvelous effects and the plot. They picked the excellent actors to play the characters. The actors Robert Downey Jr.( Iron Man), Chris Evens (Captain America), Jeremy Renner (Hawk Eye), Mark Ruffalo (Hulk), Tom Hiddleston (Loki) and many more good actors. The other reason Avengers is a fine movie to watching is the action, adventure, and the bravery. In addition ""The Avengers"" is a a satisfying movie because the heroes are trying to protect the world from the Thor's brother Loki. The movie has frequent scenes with fighting. In most of the movie Loki's army is trying to invade the world. While Thor and the rest of the avengers are trying to assure the world safety. As the world is being attack and protected at the same time. The Earths Mightiest Heroes are fighting and as music is playing it makes feel like you are in an awe while your watching the movie. After about five seconds it goes back into all the action that is accruing around the world. Furthermore, the movie ""Avengers"" has a lot of adventure. In the movie the heroes do not like each other very much but have to learned to get along especially Iron Man and Thor. ""The Avengers"" have to learned how to fight with each other and to grantee the world safety. It is an adventure because while they are on the verge to fight Loki and his army. They make Hulk mad and he turns into the green monster and he conveniently almost kills BlackWidow. Although there is a abundant of fighting, I thought there should have been scenes with close friends and family. It would have been better if some of the heroes might have said bye to their families. I thought they should have to said they might not make it back to some one they love. The movie would be a fantastic movie if they had just a little less action. Evidently In this movie there is a lot of bravery. There is bravery when Iron man says ""We have a Hulk"" telling Loki to back Down in different words. As they are fighting when they get knocked down they just get back up. There is even more bravery when Loki throws Iron Man out the Window and iron man is brave and waits for his suit to come and save him. Even though Loki is evil he stills stands up to Hulk then Hulks repeatedly beats Loki.Finally as the movie ends the avengers meet at street and they all just stand there; Nick Furry tells them they did a good job and if there is another invasion they will avenge it. Other wise I give ""Avengers an eight because of things they could have done to make the the story better. So they would have got people caught up in the sympathy.",8.0,2012-11,Thursday,"about:0.02, action:0.05, actors:0.10, after:0.03, all:0.03, almost:0.04, along:0.04, although:0.04, america:0.02, an:0.06, and:0.20, another:0.03, are:0.11, army:0.08, around:0.04, as:0.07, at:0.04, avengers:0.14, back:0.14, be:0.02, because:0.11, been:0.05, being:0.03, better:0.06, brother:0.04, but:0.02, captain:0.02, characters:0.02, chris:0.03, come:0.03, could:0.03, did:0.03, different:0.04, do:0.03, done:0.03, down:0.07, downey:0.03, each:0.05, effects:0.03, especially:0.03, even:0.05, evil:0.04, excellent:0.04, fantastic:0.04, feel:0.03, fight:0.07, fighting:0.16, finally:0.04, for:0.02, from:0.02, get:0.08, give:0.03, goes:0.04, good:0.06, got:0.04, had:0.03, has:0.04, have:0.16, he:0.07, heroes:0.11, hiddleston:0.03, him:0.03, his:0.05, how:0.03, hulk:0.08, if:0.07, in:0.10, into:0.05, iron:0.11, is:0.21, it:0.08, jeremy:0.04, job:0.03, jr:0.03, just:0.06, less:0.04, like:0.04, little:0.03, loki:0.19, lot:0.06, love:0.03, make:0.08, makes:0.03, man:0.10, many:0.03, mark:0.03, might:0.08, more:0.04, most:0.03, movie:0.18, much:0.02, nick:0.03, not:0.03, of:0.10, on:0.02, one:0.02, other:0.09, out:0.02, people:0.03, play:0.04, plot:0.03, reason:0.04, renner:0.03, rest:0.04, robert:0.03, ruffalo:0.03, said:0.08, same:0.03, save:0.04, scenes:0.05, should:0.06, so:0.02, some:0.05, stand:0.04, story:0.02, that:0.01, the:0.48, their:0.02, them:0.02, then:0.03, there:0.15, they:0.30, things:0.04, this:0.01, thor:0.06, though:0.03, thought:0.07, time:0.02, to:0.22, tom:0.03, up:0.07, very:0.02, watching:0.06, we:0.03, when:0.07, while:0.10, will:0.02, with:0.05, world:0.19, would:0.07, you:0.02, your:0.03"

2012-10-10,"After an excruciating four year wait (the scene after the credits of 2008's Iron Man with Jackson set the Internet alight) and five films leading to this massive point, Avengers Assemble is here. This film is the cinematic peak of 2012. So much time, effort, spoilers, Comic-Con appearances and millions of other components have been put into this picture. It is a Marvel fan boy's nirvana, an action fan's expectation fulfiller and only a foetus could dislike the whole of this film. Expertly written and beautifully acted out, complete with the best special effects EVER makes Avengers Assemble not just a film to watch once or twice. It's a film to watch until your disc player explodes. Every single character gets their chance to shine and they play out well.

2012-05-10,"Aside from a few points of humor, this movie primarily features only endless lame fighting (A knocks down B, B gets up and knocks down A, A gets up... repeat over and over and over). Apparently delightful to Marvel fans, tedious and banal to those who seek something other than the simplistic, well-worn pathway to adolescent male fantasy. Yes, the special effects were well done, though somewhat inconsistent -- why is the Hulk so huge in some scenes, so human-scale in others? Why does the Hulk fear his monster's uncontrollability, when it seems perfectly coordinated with the other superheroes during the fighting, and perfectly peaceful afterward? Why is there no character development whatsoever? Oh, right, it's Marvel. Superheroes in stasis. Throwbacks to a stupider time.

2012-11-09,"The movie I chose to write my review on is the movie Avengers ,I chose this movie because it is an action packed ad enter that will blow the mind of any human being who watches it. Initially, the Avengers movie has some incredible special effects. Furthermore, the producer of the movie did a great a outstanding job in the form that he made the movie. However, the movie did have one or two scenes hear and their that were not so great, but later would insert scenes that made the watchers of the movie jump out of their seat at the movie theater. Nevertheless, you can not forget the actors who did an outstanding job to.Initially, the Movie Avengers has some outrageous special effects just like for example, the scene where hulk smashes the huge snake with ugly creatures ready to fight inside of it. Nevertheless, the scene were that me my laugh a whole lot was the scene were one of the gods from another dimension was trying to explain to hulk, that he was a god and that gods should not be beaten, hulk just grabbed him and slammed him on the ground a numerous amount of times. Additionally, another special affect was where iron man shot captain America with one of his lasers that caused captain America to fly back; and hit the ground in an instant.Significantly, I personally liked the special effect where one of the people at the god and the ballet came back and him them in the face.Ultimately, the producer did an outstanding job producing the movie and adding the special effects needed at the time needed.For example the scene where the god was talking to hulk he added the special effect that allowed hulk to slam the god on the god the hard ground.Moreover,the scene where Thor was falling out of the sky because he was trapped in a huge glass container, the producer Joss Whedon allowed him to break the glass on the cotainer an escape right before hitting the ground. Henceforth, the movie director also did a great job on the scene where one of the cops would not listen to captain America; so captain America destroyed a few of the creatures right in front of his eyes that made him listen to captain America.However, some people might get get some despite from the scenes were the creatures keep coming in and the avengers keep destroying them.Specifically, when right after hulk destroyed one of the huge snakes with creatures in because whoever it is that is watching the movie could basically predict what is going to occur next. Essentially, some people do like to predict what is going to occur next.Nevertheless, you can not forget the actors who also did an outstanding job. Additionally, like for example Chris Evans who played captain America who did an excellent job acting. In addition, Chris Hemsworth did a great job playing Thor and destroying creatures.Finally, as the reader can see the movie is on of the best movies ever made. Additionally, you should watch this movie because it will blow you away and will make not want to watch any other movie.Lastly,you will not regret watching this movie because it is an action packed adventure.",9.0,2012-11,Friday,"acting:0.03, action:0.03, actors:0.06, after:0.03, also:0.04, america:0.12, amount:0.04, an:0.14, and:0.10, another:0.06, any:0.05, as:0.01, at:0.05, avengers:0.06, away:0.04, back:0.06, be:0.02, because:0.12, before:0.03, being:0.03, best:0.02, but:0.01, came:0.03, can:0.06, captain:0.12, chris:0.06, coming:0.04, could:0.02, did:0.19, director:0.03, do:0.02, effects:0.07, evans:0.03, ever:0.03, excellent:0.03, face:0.04, few:0.03, fight:0.03, finally:0.03, for:0.04, from:0.04, get:0.05, god:0.16, going:0.06, great:0.07, hard:0.03, has:0.04, have:0.02, he:0.08, hemsworth:0.03, him:0.14, his:0.04, however:0.06, huge:0.10, hulk:0.10, in:0.10, incredible:0.03, iron:0.02, is:0.09, it:0.07, job:0.21, joss:0.02, just:0.04, keep:0.07, like:0.05, liked:0.04, lot:0.03, made:0.09, make:0.02, man:0.02, me:0.02, might:0.04, mind:0.04, movie:0.21, movies:0.02, my:0.04, next:0.07, not:0.11, of:0.16, on:0.10, one:0.09, or:0.02, other:0.02, out:0.04, packed:0.07, people:0.08, played:0.03, review:0.04, right:0.09, scene:0.17, scenes:0.07, see:0.02, should:0.06, so:0.03, some:0.10, special:0.16, that:0.14, the:0.56, theater:0.04, their:0.04, them:0.04, this:0.03, thor:0.04, time:0.02, times:0.03, to:0.16, two:0.03, want:0.03, was:0.10, watch:0.04, watching:0.06, were:0.08, what:0.04, whedon:0.02, when:0.02, where:0.16, who:0.11, whole:0.03, will:0.08, with:0.04, would:0.04, you:0.08"

2012-05-07,"For four years, Marvel fans all over the world has been anticipating for one of the biggest superhero mash-ups in motion picture history. We have been promised this movie for so long, that now one of the biggest motion picture phenomenons has finally hit theaters. Big superhero names such as Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor, and Captain America has finally recruited together, and they're off to save the world, once again, in an unstoppable group. Wow, this is easily the best movie of the year so far. I can talk for hours and hours about how excellent this movie is. First of all, director/co-writer Joss Whedon is probably one of the best storytellers to know how to make a movie and its characters realistic and relevant. Take Joss Whedon's previous film, ""The Cabin in the Woods"", for example, which does a perfect job of making the story look realistic, and the characters look totally relevant. That's the movie-making magic that Joss Whedon adds in ""The Avengers"". Filled with comical gags, this movie also feels like a 2-hour action comedy film. The jokes are timed precisely, and the humor is downright believable. Robert Downey, Jr. is still wonderful for his performance as Tony Stark, a.k.a Iron Man, Chris Hemsworth is brilliant as ""Thor"", Mark Ruffalo delivers one of the best portrayals of Bruce Banner, a.k.a The Hulk ever seen on screen, and Chris Evan delivers a more better performance as Captain America. We also have a supporting cast that reprises their roles from previous Marvel movies such as Scarlett Johansson (drop-dead gorgeous) as Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Tom Hiddleston as the villainous Loki, Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Stellan Skarsgard as Erik Selvig, and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts. It's such a wonderful treat to watch all these Marvel characters that we all know and love, and place them all into one movie. The 3-D only works a few times, but the breathtaking action scenes are just downright breathtaking, exhilarating, exciting and mostly entertaining. The action scenes are probably some of the best action scenes ever put to film. You'll be on the edge of your seat, wanting for more! The comedy is just hilariously relevant, the action is downright entertaining, and the characters are written in such a realistic way. I sat in the movie theater, with the 3-D glasses, and the entire auditorium was fully packed with tons of super fans. Everyone was laughing, applauding, and cheering during the entire 2-hour, 22-minute movie. I can easily see why! This is a non-stop exciting cinematic phenomenon that perfectly knows how to do one thing, and one thing only: give the fans what they want! ""The Avengers"" is a hilarious, exciting, breathtaking, and non-stop fun motion picture that deserves the attention given from fans all over the world. This is also one of the best movies of the year!

2012-09-01,I was not a big fan of Superhero movies because sometimes they can really be pushed a little too far and become unrealistic. The Avengers on the other hand was pretty amazing. I went to go see it 3 times with my friends and family because of its funny lines and good action. I sat thru this whole movie 3 times and it still kept me entertained. The effects weren't anything to complain about and the storyline definitely kept me interested.

2012-05-06,"The Avengers was a delight to watch. Almost two and a half hours of comic-like action with Nick Fury managing to assemble Earth's super humans and fight against Thor's little brother who found his way back from the void. Loki is angry and desperate for some attention. He almost got me to kneel! Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is arrogantly gorgeous and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) is the retro patriotic avenger, while there's an intense love/hate relationship between them that really keeps you wondering ""what the hell is going on with these two?"". Since i've started like this, it doesn't look hard to pair them heroes up.Naturally, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) come next. This combination brings up the special human skills of the characters. They are the martial arts, tactics and weapons specialists and keep more of a supporting role in the film, ""filling up -well enough- the parts where there's no cgi action"".I must say that Mark Ruffalo (Bruce Banner/HULK) was my favorite, because i could not imagine how ""these anger management issues"" could ever be tamed. Bruce Banner's zen attitude made the whole Hulk transformation even more exciting and controversial. On the other hand, Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Such a verbal relief to begin with, cause he's just THOR the deity and, oh, isn't he a challenge for The Hulk! He's practically one of the few out-of-this-realm entities who can get slightly close to his powerful energy.Last, but not least, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Thor's misunderstood and troubled brother, who NEEDS to get his revenge by any means necessary with the help of his evil army. You'll admit it yourself that he does try hard without always counting the consequences. He'd be perfect for a psychiatric study! S.H.I.E.L.D's agents are rounding up the human coordination team, with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) being the head of this operation and the only character one's probably gotten used to see in the post-credit scenes of the 'Iron Man', 'Thor' and 'Captain America' films, as well as agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg). You'll also get the chance to see Cobie Smulders (Agent Maria Hill), also known as 'Robin' in How I Met Your Mother TV series, making her Hollywood outbreak.This film consists of a cluster of actors, all getting their respectable time to shine as heroes in Stan Lee's comic masterpiece.So, here's the thing. If you've never seen any of Marvel's movies, make sure you do before you move on to The Avengers. It'll be easier to understand each character, their background, motives and nemeses. Make sure to wait for the credits to end.If you have seen all/most of them (or have read the comics), there's no doubt you won't like this one. The action is overwhelming, there's no need to focus too much on performances and DON'T forget to wait for the credits to end.",9.0,2012-05,Sunday,"action:0.07, actors:0.04, against:0.05, agent:0.12, all:0.04, almost:0.10, also:0.06, always:0.05, america:0.06, an:0.03, and:0.21, any:0.07, are:0.05, army:0.05, as:0.09, assemble:0.05, avenger:0.05, avengers:0.04, back:0.04, banner:0.08, be:0.07, because:0.03, before:0.04, being:0.04, between:0.04, black:0.03, brings:0.05, brother:0.10, bruce:0.09, but:0.02, by:0.03, can:0.03, captain:0.06, cgi:0.04, character:0.06, characters:0.03, chris:0.08, come:0.04, comic:0.07, comics:0.05, could:0.07, credits:0.11, do:0.03, does:0.04, doesn:0.04, don:0.03, downey:0.03, each:0.03, earth:0.04, end:0.08, enough:0.04, evans:0.04, even:0.03, ever:0.04, evil:0.05, exciting:0.05, favorite:0.05, few:0.04, fight:0.04, film:0.05, films:0.03, for:0.10, found:0.06, from:0.03, fury:0.08, get:0.10, getting:0.06, going:0.04, got:0.04, half:0.05, hard:0.09, have:0.04, hawkeye:0.04, he:0.17, help:0.06, hemsworth:0.04, her:0.05, here:0.04, heroes:0.07, hiddleston:0.04, his:0.12, hollywood:0.06, hours:0.05, how:0.07, hulk:0.07, if:0.06, in:0.07, iron:0.05, is:0.08, isn:0.05, it:0.05, jackson:0.04, jeremy:0.04, johansson:0.04, jr:0.04, just:0.03, keep:0.05, last:0.04, least:0.05, like:0.07, little:0.04, ll:0.15, loki:0.06, look:0.05, love:0.04, made:0.03, make:0.07, making:0.05, man:0.05, mark:0.03, marvel:0.03, me:0.03, more:0.06, most:0.03, movies:0.03, much:0.03, must:0.04, my:0.03, need:0.05, never:0.04, next:0.05, nick:0.08, no:0.10, not:0.04, of:0.19, on:0.09, one:0.07, only:0.03, or:0.03, other:0.03, out:0.03, parts:0.06, perfect:0.04, performances:0.05, probably:0.05, read:0.05, really:0.03, renner:0.04, robert:0.03, role:0.05, ruffalo:0.04, samuel:0.04, say:0.04, scarlett:0.04, scenes:0.03, see:0.06, seen:0.07, series:0.05, since:0.04, so:0.02, some:0.03, special:0.04, stark:0.04, such:0.04, super:0.04, sure:0.09, team:0.04, that:0.05, the:0.41, their:0.06, them:0.09, there:0.11, these:0.07, they:0.03, thing:0.04, this:0.10, thor:0.14, time:0.03, to:0.27, tom:0.04, tony:0.04, too:0.03, two:0.09, understand:0.05, up:0.11, used:0.05, ve:0.08, wait:0.10, was:0.04, watch:0.03, way:0.03, well:0.06, what:0.03, where:0.04, while:0.04, who:0.09, whole:0.04, widow:0.03, with:0.10, without:0.04, won:0.06, you:0.18, your:0.04"

2012-10-13,"This is a very entertaining movie. The characters are well known and the plot is simple and effective. This movie combines two important ingredients: fun and action. And the actors are very good too. I especially enjoyed Scarlett Johansson in the role of the black widow. She is really talented. Specially in that leather outfit.. The computer generated imagery ( CGI ) is impressive and the idea of the Avengers working as a real team surprised me in a positive way. The vibrant soundtrack helps a lot in the action scenes.

2012-05-06,"The Avengers is the story of some of Marvel's well known super heroes that band together in a joint effort to save the world. We know from Men in Black that the world is always in need of saving, so I will take a term from that film and say that this is 'the best, of the best, of the best'! This film has some first rate, spectacular, out of this world and any other term that I can think of to convey how good the special effects, the performances, the casting, the direction and everything else in it is. I did see it in 3-D which was totally worth the added premium. If I were wearing a hat I'd give Joss Whedon (director, writer) a hats off for delivering this action packed extravaganza. The story has very clever dialog in that, the characters are able to convey exactly what the audience needs to know without it seeming as though we are auditing a Super Hero 101 lecture. Although this is what I will call a compilation sequel, it was fresh and original and could have easily stood on its own had we not been given all of the prior introduction movies. Not that I'm complaining about any of them Iron Man Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) was successfully arrogant and enduring at the same time. His and Hulk Bruce Banner's (Mark Ruffalo) intellectual bonding was intriguing enough that I'm hoping for an Iron Man featuring Hulk follow up film. The Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) sibling rivalry could render countless sequels and was front and center in this story, but I will expect to see Heimdall (Idris Elba) in any subsequent stories or no deal. My only issue with the set up films is that there was only the small side story featuring Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) in Iron Man. I kept hearing James Brown in my head singing 'This Is a Man's World', but from where I sat it wouldn't be nothing without a woman or a hulk, I mean a girl. Natasha Romanoff held her own in this boys fight club and riding on the success of this film could easily carry a Black Widow film.

So there so-what knew to me.I liked the fact we had some time with each different superheros before come together. I really liked how the movie flowed , it not no-stop action all way thought.There were calmer scenes in this movie that i found interesting and they didn't drag on to long to make boring but action sequencing was outstanding.First time I have actually liked new Hulk (I was HUGE Huge fan of Old Hulk, i Have never given this Hulk a chance) Not fan Thor thought, I can't seem to be warn, I may need to see his movie next. see more his back story, same for Captain America.Those actions were edge of your seat stuff and lots of stuff going on at the same time.

Brilliantly made, excellent direction, the graphics can't be described. The best part is you cannot judge which actor was better because all them gave their best. And since there are aren't any references to the past so anyone who hasn't seen the earlier movies would still be able to understand every detail. I don't really have words to describe how the movie was because it literally blew my mind! I've already seen it twice in the same day.

2012-05-05,"Remember how last year we were met with an unusual abundance of superhero flicks focusing on heroes that seemed to have come out of nowhere? It was all buildup to Marvel's The Avengers, one of the most anticipated films of 2012. This is the first time I sought out a superhero film in theaters. I usually don't see them because I've never cared for them. They're not my kind of thing.This is the Freddy vs. Jason for superhero fans. The story goes like this; after Nick Fury (Jackson), leader of the agency S.H.I.E.L.D., discovers that an energy source by the name of Tesseract has opened a portal allowing Thor's brother Loki (Hiddleston) to use the source's ability to control the minds of people, he calls together, ""The Avengers."" They are The Hulk (Ruffalo), Iron Man (Downey Jr.), Hawkeye (Renner), Captain America (Evans), Thor (Hemsworth), and Black Widow (Johannson), only two of those characters never got their own film. Isn't that something? Captain America can get three, Iron Man can get two, with an upcoming third one, and Hulk can get two non-related works within the same decade, but Black Widow and Hawkeye get the cold shoulder? Guess no one wants to pull another Green Lantern.The first hour of the film is not-so-much devoted to character development, as much as character interactions; how do heroes react to being a room with other heroes? There's a nice feeling of uncertainty amongst the crowd, and we get the feeling these heroes are intimidated by the presence of possible competition. The feeling of inferiority is always lurking.Director/writer Joss Whedon, whose subversive horror film The Cabin in the Woods is also currently in theaters, has two great things going for him right now. One, he speaks to the world of fandom and nerdom, and never disconnects himself from this sort of medium. You can see he likes these heroes, and he tries to imagine how their interactions and conversations might've gone on the pages of a comic. And two, he knows how to devise a brutal, relentlessly intriguing third act that never relapses. I'm not the biggest fan of hardcore, lengthy action scenes, but the half-hour to forty minute brawl in The Avengers didn't bother me, mainly because I realized Whedon wanted to showcase all the different possibilities that could exist if six superheros fought against one destructive villain.Not to mention, how difficult it must've been to construct a film where six different heroes come together for the first time. Whedon has the task of mixing the patriotism of Captain America, the shameless cynicism of Tony Stark, the demigod-abilities of Thor, the subtleties of Hawkeye, the wise-remarks of Black Widow, and the anger of the Hulk into one coherent film. The result is superb, commendable, and utterly terrific. Each character, too, gets their own time to shine, rather than some going unsung and others fighting to get in front of the camera in a ""look at me, ma!"" sort of fashion.In the mix of all the violence, talking, and scientific jargon, occasionally, comes a nice sprinkling of humor and wit. Most of the humor comes from the wise-ass Stark, whose comedic timing and infinite possibilities may lead me to seek out Iron Man and its sequel.Marvel's The Avengers may appear to be another superhero flick, just with more heroes and less villains, but it's the effort that shines through the material. The effort, determination, and challenge of combining six different heroes was definitely something to overcome, and Joss Whedon (who is by no means a newcomer, with a resume comprised of the Television shows Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer) has made an explosive mainstream debut, with a film that dripped potential. This is a kinetic and stylistic piece of work from a man, I believe, just getting started.NOTE: Just to fuel the tired joke of Black Widow and Hawkeye never getting their own picture, anyone else anticipating the Ant-Man film in 2014?

Great super hero movie and all the characters have enough screen time, and no one hero takes over the film.

2013-06-03,"The Avengers definitely had the house riding on it. Marvel set up the film for success, releasing solo pictures of each character in the group with varying degrees of quality from pretty good (Iron Man) to terrible (Iron Man 2). Fortunately, the rest of those prequels were in the good to above average range, laying out a huge amount of hype for the granddaddy to outshine them all.On that level, the Avengers definitely does not disappoint. It is a leading candidate for the best Marvel movie thus far (the other two being X2 and X-Men: First Class), showcased by an excellent script and easy chemistry between the ensemble cast. It would probably be expected to think that Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is in a league by himself here but he is actually outshined by Mark Ruffalo and Tom Hiddleson (Bruce Banner/Hulk and Loki, respectively).Ruffalo is spot on as Bruce Banner, bringing an easygoing nature to a role that was played with much more brooding by both Eric Bana and Edward Norton. The laid back-ness offers the yin to Hulk's destructive yang, adding needed context to the misunderstood hero's backstory.Hiddleson continues to impress as the troubled Loki, thirsty to drink vengeance against his brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and willing to enslave Thor's beloved Earth to do so. Most movie adaptations of Marvel villains are pretty simple affairs, but Hiddleson wills viewers to fully understand the depth of his hatred and propensity for chaos.Chris Evans is fine as Captain America, although the fact that he plays the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four (another Marvel franchise) bothers me greatly. I'm sure there are other actors who can carry Cap's shield, so to speak. Samuel Jackson, Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson reprise their roles as Nick Fury, Hawkeye, and Black Widow to round out the crew and add another layer of bad ass-ness to the film.The plot here is standard comic book fare: Loki has teamed with a group of alien baddies to steal the power of some sort of cosmic cube that Fury is hanging onto, and the Avengers need to stop him before the world goes to poop. It's not important to explain the story as much as it is to note that Joss Whedon is proving he is a master of the spectacular.

2013-12-05,"If you are planning on watching this movie, or a similar one, then it's best you don't check IMDb out. A lot of reviews in here have been written by bots that gave the movie 10, without addressing any of its major issues.That's not to say I don't understand why anyone would like this movie, it has some qualities such as action, animation and a few laughable lines. But to a viewer that want to be entertained by more than just cheesiness, this movie fails.First of all, it commits a mistake that is pretty obvious to begin with, way too many major characters are tried to fit into one movie. We are left with some story lines for Hulk, Iron Man and Thor, the most major members of the Avengers, while Black Widow and that bowman are just forgotten.The villain is also pretty forgettable, it's Loki that's back, and he's a spoiled kid that never really seem that powerful or impressive, compared to the avengers. I am not going to spoil anything, but it seems like he attempts to be a really clever villain, but just ends up as a spoiled kid.The plot in general, is also pretty forgettable. It's standard, mediocre superheroes stuff, that you've seen a hundred times in superhero movies.If you're a die-hard superhero or marvel fan, or just enjoy action and cheesy lines, then this is your movie.

2015-10-01,"Earth's mightiest heroes gather together to fight Loki and an invading alien horde in the payoff to one of the most ambitious cinematic concepts ever, that of a shared universe between multiple films with different characters and stories. My initial reaction when I first saw Avengers three years ago was that I liked it a lot but thought it didn't quite live up to the hype. I saw it again a month later and had an even less favorable opinion, focusing more on the flaws that time around and strictly comparing it to what I considered the truly classic comic book movies. Now that I've seen it with fresh eyes after a few years and several more Marvel films (including the sequel to this one), I can say that all of the hype did influence my first opinion of it. It's hard to dispute now that it is a terrific movie that was probably the best Marvel had put out at that point.Joss Whedon does a fantastic job directing and handling the grand scope of it all. His script is smart, funny, and impressively services all the different characters well. He even improves upon some of them from their previous characterizations, particularly Black Widow. Here we get a vast improvement over her depiction in Iron Man 2. Whedon really gives Scarlett Johansson a chance to shine and prove her character deserves to stand alongside the 'big leaguers' in the group. Mark Ruffalo replaces Ed Norton as Bruce Banner and, at the time, I wasn't crazy about this. I liked Norton in his Hulk movie but I think it turned out to be a good change. Ruffalo brings something different to the role. I'm not sure how Norton could have fit in with this cast or especially how his interactions with Johansson would have been different. Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, and Robert Downey, Jr. are all perfect. Jeremy Renner is arguably the weakest link in the cast but that's largely because he isn't given as much to work with as the others. The special effects are great, except for a couple of iffy spots in the climactic battle against the Chitauri. Also, Captain America's costume was clearly still a work in progress. The blank back where a star should be just makes it seem like incomplete. That's a minor quibble, though.It's not flawless but it's damned entertaining. The action scenes, particularly the fights, are exciting and spectacular. I can't imagine any fan of the comics or the movies being disappointed by them. There's something electric about seeing the characters from the prior movies come together and interact. The little kid in me who was once satisfied to see a shoddy version of Thor appear on TV with Lou Ferrigno's Hulk would never have thought he'd see something like this on the big screen in his lifetime. Seeing these characters hanging out and fighting with and alongside each other is a dream come true for any longtime Marvel fan. Whatever else happens with this shared universe, whether Marvel ever tops this film or not, I'll always cherish the movie just for that.",8.0,2015-10,Thursday,"about:0.06, action:0.02, after:0.04, again:0.04, against:0.05, alien:0.05, all:0.08, also:0.03, always:0.04, america:0.03, an:0.05, and:0.20, any:0.07, are:0.07, around:0.05, as:0.06, at:0.05, avengers:0.02, back:0.04, banner:0.04, battle:0.04, be:0.04, because:0.03, been:0.03, being:0.04, best:0.03, between:0.04, big:0.07, black:0.03, book:0.04, brings:0.05, bruce:0.04, but:0.07, by:0.03, can:0.05, captain:0.03, cast:0.08, character:0.03, characters:0.10, chris:0.08, cinematic:0.05, come:0.07, comic:0.03, comics:0.04, could:0.03, did:0.03, didn:0.04, different:0.18, disappointed:0.05, does:0.04, downey:0.03, each:0.03, earth:0.04, effects:0.03, else:0.05, entertaining:0.04, especially:0.04, evans:0.04, even:0.06, ever:0.07, exciting:0.05, fan:0.08, fantastic:0.05, few:0.04, fight:0.04, fighting:0.05, film:0.02, films:0.07, first:0.06, for:0.06, from:0.05, funny:0.04, get:0.03, given:0.05, good:0.02, great:0.03, group:0.05, had:0.06, hard:0.05, have:0.06, he:0.08, hemsworth:0.04, her:0.10, here:0.04, heroes:0.03, hiddleston:0.04, his:0.12, how:0.07, hulk:0.05, hype:0.10, in:0.17, iron:0.03, is:0.06, isn:0.05, it:0.20, jackson:0.04, jeremy:0.04, job:0.04, johansson:0.08, joss:0.03, jr:0.03, just:0.05, less:0.05, like:0.05, liked:0.10, little:0.04, ll:0.05, loki:0.03, lot:0.04, makes:0.04, man:0.02, mark:0.03, marvel:0.10, me:0.03, more:0.05, most:0.03, movie:0.05, movies:0.08, much:0.03, my:0.05, never:0.04, norton:0.15, not:0.06, now:0.08, of:0.14, on:0.07, once:0.05, one:0.04, opinion:0.11, or:0.08, other:0.03, others:0.05, out:0.08, over:0.04, perfect:0.04, point:0.05, previous:0.05, probably:0.05, put:0.04, quite:0.04, really:0.03, renner:0.04, robert:0.03, role:0.05, ruffalo:0.07, samuel:0.04, saw:0.09, say:0.03, scarlett:0.04, scenes:0.03, screen:0.03, script:0.05, see:0.05, seeing:0.09, seem:0.06, seen:0.03, sequel:0.05, should:0.04, some:0.03, something:0.12, special:0.04, spectacular:0.05, stand:0.05, star:0.05, still:0.04, sure:0.04, that:0.19, the:0.42, their:0.03, them:0.06, there:0.03, these:0.03, think:0.03, this:0.10, thor:0.03, though:0.04, thought:0.09, time:0.05, to:0.18, together:0.06, tom:0.04, true:0.05, truly:0.05, universe:0.10, up:0.03, ve:0.04, was:0.08, wasn:0.05, we:0.03, well:0.03, what:0.03, whedon:0.06, when:0.03, where:0.04, who:0.03, widow:0.03, with:0.15, work:0.08, would:0.06, years:0.08"

2013-03-18,This movie is super hero cinematic excellence. It has one of the greatest ensemble cast ever assembled. Every actor complimented each other so well and each played their respective roles gracefully. Robert Downey Jr. was funny and portrayed the classic tony stark that he did so well in the previous iron man. He maintained all the cockiness and swagger that he had previously. Mark Ruffalo was a much better Hulk than expected. He did better than Edward Norton's portrayal in the previous film. He was very intellectual and benefited the movie well. Chris Evans was the perfect leader for this heroic crew. He had great one-liners throughout. Hawkeye and Black Widow were both good compliments to the the team also.

2013-02-12,"On May 4, 2012 many Marvel fans were on the edge of their seats, and I was one of those fans. I can say that our expectancy for the new movie ""The Avengers"" was through the roof, and we would not be happy with anything under five stars. Marvel had promised the Avengers Initiative would return, and from that point on it had been a waiting game. However, combining all of the super heroes into one great team, yet each holding their old attitudes had to take time. The wait was well worth it though; Marvel really dished it out. They produced a movie that I could watch over and over again, and never be bored. The cast was wonderful, and I can't say that there was a single actor that did not play their part perfectly. The movie was full of action, and there was never a dull moment in the humor. However, if you have not seen the other movies leading up to it, you may find yourself lost in some parts. The plot was phenomenal, and was accompanied by visual effects that put you inside the movie itself. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone, it is entertaining, humorous, and overall a blast to watch. Some of the characters showed their true colors in this movie more than in their own productions. One of my favorite quotes in the movie being Captain America's thoughts on Thor, when he says ""There is only one God, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that."" Aside from my thoughts, one actor that really deserves a round of applause is Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk. Through the movie he acts seamlessly from the doctor straight into the Hulk, and back. If you want an action packed movie with an all around amazing experience, I would definitely recommend The Avengers to you.",10.0,2013-02,Tuesday,"2012:0.06, action:0.06, actor:0.13, again:0.05, all:0.05, amazing:0.05, america:0.04, an:0.07, and:0.22, anything:0.06, around:0.06, as:0.03, avengers:0.08, back:0.06, be:0.06, been:0.04, being:0.05, by:0.04, can:0.07, captain:0.04, cast:0.05, characters:0.03, could:0.05, definitely:0.06, did:0.05, doesn:0.06, each:0.04, effects:0.04, entertaining:0.06, everyone:0.05, experience:0.07, fans:0.11, favorite:0.06, find:0.07, for:0.02, from:0.10, full:0.07, god:0.06, great:0.04, had:0.12, have:0.03, he:0.11, heroes:0.04, highly:0.07, however:0.12, hulk:0.06, humor:0.06, if:0.07, in:0.11, into:0.09, is:0.06, it:0.11, itself:0.07, like:0.03, many:0.05, mark:0.05, marvel:0.11, may:0.12, moment:0.07, more:0.04, movie:0.21, movies:0.03, my:0.07, never:0.10, new:0.05, not:0.09, of:0.14, old:0.07, on:0.12, one:0.14, only:0.04, other:0.04, our:0.07, out:0.04, over:0.10, overall:0.06, own:0.06, packed:0.07, part:0.06, parts:0.07, perfectly:0.07, play:0.07, plot:0.05, point:0.06, pretty:0.06, put:0.06, really:0.07, recommend:0.14, ruffalo:0.05, say:0.09, seen:0.05, single:0.07, some:0.07, stars:0.07, super:0.05, sure:0.06, take:0.06, team:0.05, than:0.04, that:0.19, the:0.38, their:0.19, there:0.10, they:0.03, this:0.04, thor:0.04, those:0.05, though:0.06, through:0.12, time:0.04, to:0.10, true:0.07, up:0.04, visual:0.07, wait:0.07, want:0.06, was:0.24, watch:0.08, we:0.05, well:0.04, were:0.04, when:0.04, with:0.05, worth:0.06, would:0.16, yet:0.06, you:0.15"
2012-05-21,"It almost seems superfluous to add more to the mountain of reviews for this movie but that never stopped me before.When I was a boy I used to go to market stalls and buy Marvel comics (if only I'd kept them I could retire a rich man). So far so normal but this was in the UK where comics meant the Beano and Dandy. You couldn't rely on collecting a whole series of a particular title in the 1960s – it was just a matter of luck what had been imported and was up for sale. It was pretty much a minority interest in the UK. I say this much just to make the point that I have been a fan of Marvel characters for more years then I would like to admit to and so I fit that dreadful fan boy demographic from an earlier generation. I feel I know the characters and I know how they should be treated.Avengers Assemble, as it is known in the UK to distinguish it from a beloved TV series of a different nature, is a film that I was able to enjoy as a fan. The characters were well developed and the interaction between them was particularly well handled and affectionate. The action scenes were well handled, though I have some reservations about the not-always impressive CGI that slipped through in places. I thought it would be too long at 143 minutes but I was never aware of the passing of time whilst watching it and it did not feel like the marathon that some 90 minute movies can sometimes be.Some people have criticised it on the grounds that the plot is too simple and obvious or that the dialogue is too jokey but it fits the requirements for this type of film based on this type of material and what a joy it is to have Whedon's turn of phrase and playfulness. If you want to look at the underlying machinery, then it follows the hero's journey template like many (most?) other successful movies, except it has to fit all the characters into the journey.It's not the world's greatest movie and it's not art house but then it was never intended to be. It's good fun and delivers as much as a fan could want. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk was a stand out for me. The two previous Hulk outings have been pretty awful in my estimation but this was pitch perfect and the Hulk delivered the best laughs in the movie.I don't really know how you compare an art-house movie with a blockbuster fun movie. It probably can't be done.

2012-05-08,"That was one of the worst B.S. comic book movies ever. It's as bad as the first Hulk movie and the Green Lantern movie with Ryan Reynolds. Some of the scenes in the Avengers, from the beginning to end, were complete non- sense, very unnecessary, felt forced, lack creativity and almost amateurish. I don't understand the high ratings, and the high gross for the movie, which is attributed to the $50.00 (3D fees) per person. Are some of you people on some kind of drugs? Maybe Inhaling too much theater popcorn chemicals or something? Brain-washed by Joss Whedon? I loved his movies and TV shows, but 1hr and 40mins before we see any real actions? and You guys think it's a good movie? Come on, It's the same crap as the first Hulk movie.

2012-05-05,"'THE AVENGERS': Five Stars (Out of Five) Joss Whedon directed and co-wrote (with Zak Penn) this long awaited film adaptation of the Marvel comic book. Marvel Studios has been building a story arc to this film through five other individual comic book superhero movies (2008's 'IRON MAN' and 'THE INCREDIBLE HULK', 2010's 'IRON MAN 2' and 2011's 'THOR' and 'CAPTAIN America'). They brought on Whedon (who many comic book and film fans worship) to co-write and direct the film and being a true comic book fan himself he knew exactly what the fans wanted to see. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Stellan Skarsgard, Gwyneth Paltrow and Paul Bettany all reprise their roles from other Marvel comics movies and Mark Ruffalo was brought in to replace Edward Norton as 'The Hulk'. The movie is a comic book fan's orgasmic dream come true, all other film fans and audiences should be more than pleased as well though.The story of 'The Avengers' revolves around the world peace keeping agency known as S.H.I.E.L.D.. Nick Fury (Jackson once again) is the director of the agency and has spent the last five Marvel movies recruiting superheroes for a special team known as the Avengers. When Loki (Hiddleston again), brother of Thor, invades the planet and steals the Tesseract, which he uses to control the minds of multiple S.H.I.E.L.D. agents including Hawkeye (Renner again), it's finally time for Fury to call on the Avengers to assemble and save the world. Loki wants to use the Tesseract to enslave the planet unless Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk and the others can stop him. The heroes must work through their own inner demons and conflicts with each other before they can work as a team and find the strength they need to stop Loki and his army.I was expecting something much more campy and mainstream fun but Whedon takes the material very seriously and actually structured a really well written story which develops all of the key characters pretty evenly (with the exception of Hawkeye). Most comic movies kind of cheat their fans by trying more to appeal to the masses whereas this film makes the comic book audience it's target audience (as it should). It doesn't do so to the extent of losing the interest of everyone else though. For me I much more enjoyed 'THE DARK KNIGHT', 'SPIDER MAN 2' or 'X2' as far as comic book films go but I can really appreciate this film. It doesn't give me as big a boner as a lot of my comic book friends but it's definitely a crowd pleasing action film and one of the best of it's kind. I don't know as much about the source material as comic book nerds but I know a good movie and this is one.

2012-07-20,"I was able to experience the Avengers mania. It was a fun filled movie. Robert Downey as Iron Man was a treat to watch, Chris Evans as Captain America was exciting, Chris Hemsworth as Thor was good, but felt he was little overshadowed (But loved to see THOR though) and Hawkeye, Nick Fury and black widow were good in their roles.Mark Ruffalo emerged to become the best among the AVENGERS. Excellent portrayal of Dr.Brcue Banner/ Hulk.On the other side i never felt LOKI to be a formidable opponent for the AVENGERS.He could have been a part of a team of Baddies.

2012-05-24,"So if your wanting an awesome movie for the summer this is so far the number one to go see. It starts off with a bang and doesn't ever leave you wanting much more. Even if you have never seen any of the Solo Avenger(Superhero films in the past 2 years)movies it doesn't matter. Starts off with awesome plot and builds the entire time until the climax of the film happens and you will not even know when it's going to start or finish. If you like the other super hero movies this one will not let you down unless of course you see it after you watch the only other movie worth seeing this summer, ""The Dark Knight Rises"". Only seen teasers for it but know it will be the number one movie, because easily topping it's predecessor, The Dark Knight. I suggest only two movies to watch in theaters this summer are The Avengers, and The Dark Knight Rises. Mr Nolan will absolutely kill the competition with the best Batman movies to date.......(except Jack Nickolson as the joker) Strong 8 out of 10 just because it's a must see film this summer!!!

Rewatching The Avengers, I'm reminded just how big of a deal it was when this film first brought all the heroes together. Four years into the Marvel journey, seeing them finally assemble on screen is still pretty exciting, even if it's not my absolute favourite of phase one.The first hour of the film is what really grabs me. I love the way the characters interact as they meet for the first time-there's something fun about watching these larger-than-life personalities clash and try to figure each other out. Stark and Banner, in particular, have a great dynamic that I always enjoy. The expansion of SHIELD's role in the story also adds some nice layers to the film, giving it more scope and a sense of a bigger world beyond just the superheroes.That said, the extended battle at the end just doesn't do much for me. It's visually impressive, sure, but I find myself less engaged with the non-stop action. It also feels like this is where the franchise starts down a path of needing to constantly up the ante with bigger and bigger stakes. While it's exciting, I think it sometimes comes at the cost of more interesting character moments.One thing that stands out to me, even on rewatch, is how much friction there is between the characters in the beginning. Everyone seems to be at each other's throats, which can be a bit much at times. I get that it's meant to build up to that big ""assemble"" moment, and it does make that payoff feel earned, but I've always felt the conflict was a bit forced.Still, The Avengers is quite the achievement in bringing all these characters together in a way that feels cohesive and fun. It's a solid film that I still enjoy watching, even if I do find myself more drawn to the quieter, character-driven moments than the explosive action.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.0

2019-12-22,"If you are a big fan of superhero movies, this is the best choice for you. Plenty of supernatural power and high technology are served. Also a variety of characters too. This is the first time 6 legends of MCU met each other. Moreover, this is the debut of the villain that creates the most connection with audience. Absolutely, I can say this is a unforgettable movie.
The film started in S.H.I.E.L.D. There were a research about Tesseract, one of the most powerful weapons and energy sources that came from space. This ambition of humanity brought Loki to the world. He destroyed everything to get Tesseract and throne. Moreover, he use his wand to control Hawkeye. Therefore, S.H.I.E.L.D. had to have heroes to fight and that made 6 unique persons to be Avengers. Tony Stark, or Iron man, was the first one in Avengers. Then, Natasha, Hulk, Captain america, and Thor followed. Could they beat Loki and how? Or could they bring Hawkeye back?
I like all of the actors and actresses in this movie. They could present their characters and understand them deeply. Especially, the 6 Avengers. The first one, Robert Downey Jr. , as Iron man, he is a very high experience actor and his performance represent Tony Stark very good. His funny habit made us more enjoy in this movie. The second one, Scarlett Johansson, as Natasha, she is female delegate that as important and talent as male. Although she didn't have any supernatural power, her mind and her physical is very strong. And Johansson can do it so well. Next one, Mark Ruffalo, as Hulk, although he wasn't the first man who act as Hulk, he can handle it perfectly both human form and Hulk form. He made us believe it was a monster inside him. The fourth and also the first Avengers, Captain america, played by Chris Evan. He is the one who had highest leadership, suitable to captain's position. He could make people love Captain america even though he didn't have any supernatural power except a Vibranium shield and America flag colored suit. The last one, Hawkeye, presented by Jeremy Renner, I really like him in this movie. He did so nice in the scene he was controlled. It looked like he was really controlled.
In this film, I think it was a gorgeous to see all the Avengers met each other and fight together. The story was continuously and smoothly from the beginning to the end. On the other hand, maybe, the way to pull Hawkeye out of control had to be harder. Also the way to beat enemy.

The Avengers is first of all- Not the best movie ever made nor is The Avengers better than The Dark Knight or even Spiderman 2. If someone tells you different , they may have the mind of a five year old. The action is good and the characters all play their roles great, but something is missing in this movie.If the main villain Loki and his crew of aliens became a threat to any city in the U.S. I would laugh and take my chances. Am I the only one wondering where were the U.S.Airforce ,Marines,Army or even the Navy,when a whole entire city is being attacked ? Who were the aliens shooting at when they came from outerspace ? They sure wasn't hitting the people running around in the middle of the street during the entire battle scene.Did any hardworking bank employee,cop,or other random person running in the street get hurt? I didn't see any. Bad writing and action sequences ruined this movie. I was also wondering,couldn't Thor just electrocute most of the aliens for about 30 mins instead of fighting them one on one? He can control lighting. I would still say this movie is entertaining but watched by fans and viewers with common sense , this movie is a comedy and very very very overrated.",5.0,2012-05,Thursday,"10:0.06, about:0.09, action:0.07, all:0.06, also:0.05, am:0.06, and:0.18, any:0.16, are:0.03, army:0.07, around:0.07, at:0.04, avengers:0.09, bad:0.06, battle:0.06, being:0.06, best:0.04, better:0.05, but:0.08, by:0.04, came:0.07, can:0.04, characters:0.04, comedy:0.08, couldn:0.08, dark:0.07, did:0.05, didn:0.06, different:0.07, don:0.05, entertaining:0.06, entire:0.16, even:0.09, ever:0.05, fans:0.06, fighting:0.07, first:0.05, for:0.03, from:0.07, funny:0.06, get:0.05, giving:0.08, good:0.08, great:0.08, have:0.03, he:0.04, his:0.04, if:0.08, in:0.10, instead:0.08, is:0.19, it:0.02, its:0.10, just:0.07, knight:0.07, know:0.06, loki:0.04, made:0.05, main:0.07, may:0.07, mind:0.07, most:0.05, movie:0.21, my:0.04, next:0.07, not:0.06, of:0.14, old:0.07, on:0.07, one:0.10, only:0.05, or:0.16, other:0.04, people:0.11, play:0.08, real:0.21, reviews:0.16, saw:0.07, say:0.11, scene:0.06, see:0.04, sense:0.07, sequences:0.07, something:0.06, star:0.08, stars:0.08, still:0.11, sure:0.07, take:0.06, than:0.05, that:0.03, the:0.47, their:0.04, them:0.04, they:0.11, this:0.17, thor:0.04, to:0.05, very:0.13, villain:0.06, was:0.03, wasn:0.07, watched:0.07, were:0.09, what:0.04, when:0.09, where:0.06, who:0.04, whole:0.06, with:0.03, would:0.09, writing:0.08, year:0.07, you:0.03"
2013-04-14,My other favourite superhero film(s) are those of the Dark Knight Trilogy and as they are so dark it's nice to watch a film which is more light hearted. Although verging on corny the humour was good and the story gripping although fairly standard. The character relationships are great and Mark Ruffalo is particularly good as the Hulk. All the acting is pretty secure and the effects good. All the actors suit their roles and bring together a successful film on a group of heroes (sounds easier than it is).

After reading all the euphoric reviews on the Internet, I decided to watch the movie tonight. I even saw it in 3D. The movie was just as bad, as the trailer looked. The villain Loki wasn't interesting or threatening at all. Whatever happened to a good villain ? The whole story was REALLY, REALLY WEAK. The whole story reminded me very much of Transformer 3, and was just as bad. I don't understand why so many people here praise this movie. If this is supposedly the best super hero movie Hollywood is able to make in 2012: Good night. I don't understand why it is so hard for Hollywood to make a great movie , with a really good, dramatic, epic story. There are so many good comic book stories out there, it can't be that hard to just turn them into a good movie. I was just as disappointed from this movie, as I was from Transformers 3. I definitely WON'T watch this movie again at the movie theater , or buy it on DVD. Hoolywood has become so boring, it's sad.

2012-09-28,"Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) brings the Avengers together to locate and obtain the Tesseract, a cube of untold power that could possibly power the whole world, but it is also needed by Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to open a portal for his army to come through and subjugate the people of earth to his will. The Avengers have their work cut out for them once they stop fighting with each other and learn to get along. This is, perhaps, the best CGI I have ever seen along with fantastic editing. I know in the past we had very good CGI with Beowulf, Live Free or Die Hard, Transformers and 2012 among some others, but a true salute should go to Director Joss Whedon and maybe an Oscar as well. This was truly well organized, and seamless throughout. The story was plausible without getting into silliness and unbelievable cartoon animation effects. And, effective dialogues helped make this as real as possible. Kudos. Who are the Avengers? Ironman (Robert Downey Jr), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), The Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). I was not familiar with The Black Widow and Hawkeye. I was looking for Billy Batson (Captain Marvel) but he was from an older time and that is the only explanation I could think of. Poor Billy Batson was probably in a old-age home, and he was never referenced in this. So,.. no ""Shazzam"" for us. Pity. The thing I noticed is the storyline kind of continued a slender thread from previous Ironman, and Thor movies. Thor was assured that his love interest, Jane (Natalie Portman) was safe from what was going to happen in this Manhattan, NY location. I am pretty sure we saw Scarlett Johansson in one of the previous Ironman movies, but not as the Black Widow and am not sure what role she did play. And, of course, there was Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) Tony Stark's (Ironman) love interest. Yes, she still looks very good, but, at first I thought someone else played Pepper as the actress didn't, at first, look like Paltrow. But it was her. Maybe getting a little long in the tooth does that. Go figure. Hey, it will happen to all of us. Bummer. Also, we noticed that Tom Hiddleston also played Loki in the movie THOR. So this was like old home week for some of this cast and for us as well. Very good. I don't like giving Oscars to bad guys or in this case, bad gods, but I must say Hiddleston's Loki was very good and may get one. He was almost likable at times. Did I really say that? All in all this is one terrific movie and the pacing is excellent; and you will forget all about the snacks you brought in to see this movie as your eyes never leave the screen. It's mesmerizing. There may be some confusion for a while when you do not understand why The Avengers are at each other's throats for the longest time. And, you cannot figure out why Hawkeye is working for Loki (the bad god and stepbrother of Thor). But, stay with it and it will all work out and you will understand. The acting performances all around are first rate. And, again, not enough can be said about the CGI, the editing, the fights and battle scenes and the cinematography as well. All were terrific.

2024-12-19,"The Avengers (2012), directed by Joss Whedon, marked a landmark moment in cinematic history by successfully bringing together Marvel's most iconic superheroes into a cohesive, action-packed team-up. The film follows Nick Fury, the leader of S. H. I. E. L. D., as he assembles a group of extraordinary individuals-including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner)-to stop Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor's adoptive brother, from using an alien army to conquer Earth. The film expertly balances character development with explosive action sequences, giving each hero their moment to shine. Robert Downey Jr.'s charismatic portrayal of Iron Man and the dynamic between the characters, especially the witty banter and team friction, provide both humor and heart. The interactions between the heroes, who often clash due to their egos and differing methods, are central to the film's success. Loki's menacing presence adds a compelling antagonist to the mix, and the visual effects, particularly during the climactic Battle of New York, are breathtaking. The film is also notable for how it laid the foundation for the interconnected MCU, showing how individual stories could seamlessly come together. The Avengers is a thrilling, fun, and emotionally resonant film that not only defined a generation of superhero movies but also proved the power of shared cinematic universes.",10.0,2024-12,Thursday,"2012:0.09, action:0.08, alien:0.09, also:0.12, america:0.05, an:0.05, and:0.19, are:0.08, army:0.09, as:0.04, avengers:0.08, battle:0.08, between:0.15, black:0.06, both:0.09, brother:0.09, but:0.03, by:0.10, captain:0.05, character:0.05, characters:0.05, chris:0.15, cinematic:0.19, come:0.07, could:0.06, development:0.09, downey:0.12, each:0.06, earth:0.08, effects:0.06, especially:0.08, evans:0.08, film:0.22, for:0.07, from:0.05, fun:0.07, fury:0.07, giving:0.10, group:0.09, hawkeye:0.07, he:0.05, hemsworth:0.08, hero:0.07, heroes:0.06, hiddleston:0.07, how:0.12, hulk:0.04, humor:0.08, in:0.03, individual:0.10, into:0.06, iron:0.09, is:0.06, it:0.03, jeremy:0.08, johansson:0.08, joss:0.06, jr:0.13, loki:0.11, man:0.09, mark:0.06, marvel:0.05, mcu:0.10, moment:0.19, most:0.06, movies:0.05, new:0.07, nick:0.07, not:0.04, of:0.17, only:0.06, packed:0.09, power:0.09, renner:0.08, robert:0.12, ruffalo:0.06, scarlett:0.07, sequences:0.09, stop:0.09, superhero:0.06, superheroes:0.07, team:0.13, that:0.03, the:0.47, their:0.10, thor:0.10, to:0.17, together:0.11, tom:0.07, up:0.05, visual:0.09, whedon:0.06, who:0.05, widow:0.06, with:0.04, witty:0.10, york:0.10"
2016-01-03,"Now this is how you do a summer blockbuster, the Avengers is a movie that not only throws you full blown special effects action and laughter, but actually a little emotion too and that makes all the difference. The story see's well the Avengers Assemble, bad things are coming toward the security of the globe and so S.H.I.E.L.D gather together superheroes and the like to come to try and come to the rescue. It may not sound like the best film through my explanation but believe me this is pretty epic as movies like this go, the film only goes to show that superhero movies can be great and that special effects don't always ruin a movie every time.Joss Whedon directs this and writes this and hey does he do a good job, not only does he make it thrilling and fast, he also manages to let the movie never take itself completely seriously, the jokes here and there and fantastic. Whedon also manages as mentioned to create a film that has these impossible things on show and yet they don't just look stupid, I felt at first glance that this would look too over the top in the Sci-fi department but really they actually work very well all the gadgets etc. The action quota is thoroughly taken care of as well and yet again the fighting scenes have a little tinge of humour in there making this movie a whole host of things.Of course with such a big film comes a big cast and this movie throws stars at you left right and centre including such names as Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson. To any person who has seen Marvel movies beforehand then you will know a lot of the cast, this movie is of course many other movies meeting on the same path. As the acting goes it is hard to really spot who stands out above the rest, everyone does a good job and no one lets the team down, I particularly liked Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man as he just breathes a lot of humour into this. I was never overly sure on the role of S.H.I.E.L.D in this and some of the cast who are in the organisation don't get the best lines exactly, Whedon does though manage to get Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) to be pretty cool at times.I think the special effects here are pretty nice, I mean come on the film's budget is huge but it's the way in which it looks that makes it feel different to other big blockbusters. Not only do we have movies coming together as one but we also see a film that uses effects on a huge scale and then also although having to use them a hell of a lot, still the movies does not suffer so badly. Films will never look quite right using effects but the Avengers goes a long way in making a movie that is huge on them and yet does not make it look ugly or something to condone as bad.All in all the film is great, and I mean it, great fun, great acting and just some great thrills to be had. Marvel do seem to pump out movies everywhere and I am glad that the Avengers has not been lost in the massive whirlpool that is Marvel movies, it stands out because it's so big and epic and is definitely a memorable one. I would say this is one for the fans but I have no idea in truth, although I will say that I don't think many people can find a whole host of problems with this, it's a film that has been cared for and made in a way that is not just a little escapism and that is it, it's something you can watch again.",8.0,2016-01,Sunday,"acting:0.06, action:0.03, actually:0.06, again:0.06, agent:0.04, all:0.06, also:0.09, although:0.07, always:0.03, am:0.03, and:0.29, any:0.03, are:0.05, as:0.14, assemble:0.04, at:0.06, avengers:0.06, bad:0.06, be:0.05, because:0.02, been:0.05, believe:0.04, best:0.04, big:0.10, blockbuster:0.04, but:0.10, can:0.06, care:0.04, cast:0.08, come:0.08, comes:0.03, coming:0.08, cool:0.04, course:0.07, definitely:0.03, different:0.03, do:0.10, does:0.16, don:0.10, down:0.03, downey:0.05, effects:0.12, epic:0.07, every:0.03, everyone:0.03, fans:0.03, fantastic:0.03, feel:0.03, felt:0.03, fighting:0.04, film:0.14, films:0.02, find:0.04, first:0.02, for:0.03, full:0.04, fun:0.03, get:0.05, go:0.03, goes:0.12, good:0.04, great:0.10, had:0.02, hard:0.03, has:0.08, have:0.05, having:0.04, he:0.08, here:0.06, how:0.02, huge:0.10, humour:0.08, idea:0.04, in:0.12, into:0.02, iron:0.02, is:0.16, it:0.15, itself:0.04, jackson:0.03, job:0.06, johansson:0.03, joss:0.02, jr:0.05, just:0.07, know:0.03, left:0.04, let:0.04, like:0.05, liked:0.04, lines:0.04, little:0.09, long:0.03, look:0.14, looks:0.04, lot:0.08, made:0.02, make:0.05, makes:0.06, making:0.07, man:0.02, many:0.05, marvel:0.06, may:0.03, me:0.02, movie:0.09, movies:0.15, my:0.02, never:0.08, nice:0.04, no:0.05, not:0.12, now:0.03, of:0.13, on:0.10, one:0.06, only:0.09, or:0.02, other:0.04, out:0.06, over:0.03, people:0.03, pretty:0.09, quite:0.03, really:0.04, rest:0.04, right:0.06, robert:0.02, role:0.04, same:0.03, samuel:0.03, say:0.05, scarlett:0.03, scenes:0.02, see:0.04, seem:0.04, seen:0.03, show:0.07, so:0.05, some:0.04, something:0.06, special:0.08, stark:0.03, stars:0.04, still:0.03, story:0.02, such:0.06, summer:0.04, superhero:0.02, superheroes:0.03, sure:0.03, take:0.03, team:0.03, that:0.20, the:0.37, them:0.04, then:0.05, there:0.04, these:0.03, they:0.04, things:0.10, think:0.05, this:0.15, though:0.03, through:0.03, time:0.02, times:0.03, to:0.17, together:0.04, tony:0.03, too:0.05, top:0.03, very:0.02, was:0.01, watch:0.02, way:0.07, we:0.05, well:0.06, whedon:0.07, which:0.02, who:0.07, whole:0.06, will:0.06, with:0.03, work:0.03, would:0.04, yet:0.10, you:0.08"

2014-04-16,"""Marvel's The Avengers"" broke box-office records in the summer of 2012, with the highest grossing opening weekend of all time, and the third highest grossing payout in it's movie-theater career, just behind ""Avatar"" and ""Titanic."" This major Hollywood blockbuster made cinematic history, by bringing together the ""Earth's Mightiest Heroes,"" Marvel comic-book characters created by ""Stan Lee""(Stanley Martin Lieber), and finally giving them their big-screen break.The great thing about ""The Avengers"" is that there is no single leading character. Each of the characters, ""Captain America,"" ""Iron Man,"" ""The Incredible Hulk,"" ""Hawkeye,"" and ""Black Widow"" equally share screen time, having already been sufficiently established in their previous stand-alone films.The antagonist in this film,""Loki,"" is portrayed by actor Tom Hiddleston. ""Loki,"" in the ""Marvel Comics"" is actually the step-brother of ""Thor,"" one of the primary ""Avengers."" He uses his cunning, sly, and deliciously-devious character to steal the power of the ""Tesseract,"" a cosmic power source, and bring a ""chitauri"" army of aliens to take control of the Earth.""Marvel's The Avengers"" was directed by Joss Whedon, who is currently directing the highly anticipated sequel, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron."" A few of his other works include ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" ""Cabin in the Woods,"" ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" and ""Toy Story,"" all reasonably known projects.Although I can hardly imagine an audience that would disapprove of this film, I must give a warning out to movie-go'ers who are not keen to special-effects action sequences, and some intense scenes, as these are largely found in ""The Avengers.""As made evident by the tone of my review, you can probably tell that I deeply enjoyed this movie.

2012-11-15,"The movie was not what I expected at first. By watching it , I really thought it was a good action movie. Most action movies I have seen I thought this was one of my top movies. By using the actors Whedon has used made this movie even better.. The actors that played Thor(Chris Hemsworth), Hulk( Mark Ruffalo), Captain America(Chris Evans ) , Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr. ), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye( Jeremy Renner )and Loki(Tom Hiddleston ) . Worked really well together and got to show their own strength in the movie. The evil Loki didn't really get to show that much of his evil. I think they should of showed more of his evil side. It mostly looked like it followed the story line of Thor because it was mostly about him and Loki. When I watched this Black Widow and Haweye I didn't really know because they didn't have their own movie outside of this movie and I don't really read comics but by seeing this movie it made me want to watch more of this kind of movies. I would watch this movie again. The special effects were really good it went well with catching the audience's attention and to keep watching it. I think they should of changed the setting of the battle that happened in Manhattan, where the bad guys went against the heroes .The ending kind of made you think there was going to be a second one coming out, and not leave you hanging like most other movies. The best scene I think was the best in the movie was when all of them were stopping the portal thing that Loki had opened and they all came together.It showed how even though they have different techniques on fighting there enemy that can still help each other and defeat the enemy.

2013-04-19,"I'm a long time Marvel comic reader and know the superheroes in the Avengers quite extensively. Hulk being my number one read and the Avengers in my top 10. This movie was well made with loads of entertainment possibly to capture all audience members who have very little to no knowledge of Marvel comics. If I was to walk into this movie without knowing anything about Marvel comics, I would have been thoroughly entertained. The computer generation was fantastic. Visual effects were stunning. We've come along way since Superman with Christopher Reeve. The actors skills were superb, especially Robert Downey Jr. I loved all the humour chucked in. These light moments were well placed at the proper scenes. That being said, to add just a couple complaints as a die hard Marvel fan, here is how Marvel could have made this a better movie and future movies. 1. Loki, there could have been a more original villain. Regurgitating an old foe from the Thor film was lame. There is so many choices that could have been used. 2. Thus speaking of Thor, this is not the real Thor. I didn't like the Thor film and I certainly would not give it the votes I give the Avengers. Thor in the comic book was much bigger and possessed more power and abilities. I think Marvel should have used CGI technologywith Thor's character instead of using a real life actor. They did a great job with Hulk, so why not make Thor with a awesome physique and structure? Another little thing to notice, actually my wife did, is Scarlett Johansson. The scenes where she is running is hilarious. I think she should have practised those scenes better, because she looks like she just discovered her legs and their movement.

2012-05-06,"I have watched several films that span across many different categories and time-frames (everything from the absolute greatest to the all-time worst rated films). In my honest opinion, I believe that the movie is far from perfection, but definitely in the 9 range.A superhero film like this calls for tons of action and excitement and this movie delivers on every level and then some. A wonderful cast made it seem believably true - a rock-hard culmination of protagonists and antagonists in cooperation to fight the good fight against an unruly evil. Even if you were attending just to see one superhero, you would still get a kick from the others in the bunch. They were all at the top of their game in this film and there was not a single head in the audience that was not sitting at the edge of their seat in amazement.Excellent cast, great dialogue, wonderful camera shots for the action scenes and trust me, there were plenty of action scenes to go around. Several fights going on at the same time, so if you were disappointed with one fight, you can eagerly await as the camera approached another fight scene and it was constant battle to the very end!

2022-05-11,"""The Avengers"" from 2012 might not seem like much today, but the concept of teaming up an all-star cast of superheroes who had previously appeared in their own films seemed like a catastrophe waiting to happen. It seemed like the amount of characters involved would lead to a bloated plot without any payoff or depth.I will say that this movie completely delivers on its promise of bringing the entire MCU roster (up to that point) in an incredibly satisfying fashion to the big screen. The action sequences that include all of the Avengers fighting side by side are so fun to watch, and the characters all have so much chemistry between them.The movie takes a little bit to get going. Setting up a villain, assembling the team, giving us scenes where they grow relationships. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, and the rest of the heroes all do great here. It is a little disappointing to see Loki (Tom Hiddleston) back in the reigns again so soon after his appearance in Thor's solo film from a year before. He does have an army of aliens to command this time which is cool.This is the kind of movie that just leaves you asking for more. It's two and a half hours long but I feel like it could have been longer to help give the characters more room to breathe and get to know each other.",8.0,2022-05,Wednesday,"2012:0.08, action:0.04, after:0.06, again:0.07, all:0.13, amount:0.10, an:0.13, and:0.10, any:0.06, are:0.04, army:0.09, avengers:0.07, back:0.07, been:0.06, before:0.07, between:0.07, big:0.06, bit:0.07, but:0.07, by:0.05, cast:0.07, characters:0.13, chris:0.14, cool:0.09, could:0.06, depth:0.09, do:0.06, does:0.06, downey:0.06, each:0.06, entire:0.09, evans:0.07, feel:0.07, fighting:0.08, film:0.04, films:0.06, for:0.03, from:0.09, fun:0.06, get:0.11, give:0.07, giving:0.09, going:0.07, great:0.05, had:0.05, half:0.08, have:0.11, he:0.05, help:0.10, hemsworth:0.07, here:0.07, heroes:0.06, hiddleston:0.07, his:0.05, hours:0.09, in:0.12, is:0.08, it:0.11, its:0.06, jr:0.06, just:0.04, kind:0.09, know:0.06, like:0.17, little:0.14, loki:0.05, long:0.07, mcu:0.09, might:0.09, more:0.09, movie:0.09, much:0.10, not:0.04, of:0.21, on:0.04, or:0.05, other:0.05, own:0.07, plot:0.06, point:0.08, rest:0.09, robert:0.06, say:0.06, scenes:0.06, screen:0.06, see:0.05, seem:0.10, seemed:0.19, sequences:0.08, so:0.13, star:0.09, superheroes:0.06, takes:0.09, team:0.06, that:0.12, the:0.37, their:0.05, them:0.05, they:0.04, this:0.08, thor:0.05, time:0.05, to:0.29, tom:0.07, two:0.07, up:0.14, us:0.08, villain:0.07, watch:0.05, where:0.07, which:0.05, who:0.05, will:0.05, without:0.07, would:0.05, year:0.08, you:0.04"
2012-11-02,"i ve seen a couple of negative reviews about this movie in here.. people complain that its not unique like The Star wars, or Matrix or similar movies that came out there with very inventive ideas and gave us something new to think about.. well.. this movie isn't that, and its not supposed to be either.. anyone who is somewhat familiar with comic book characters, do know who these guys are. and for so many years we have been craving !! to see a good flick where they are brought together with good effects, good plot, and good action. the idea has been out there for decades.. we don't want anything new from it, we just wanted what we already know to be presented in a nice package .. and yes.. they did itThe Avengers answers these all.. maybe not to perfection, but far the best so far. i had a great time watching this movie.. i enjoyed the action, i enjoyed how V.S. between heros was incorporated, and i loved the great sense of humor.. i laughed a god damn lot.. and in the end, i was satisfied, and yes, time after time i went back and saw it again.. hell yes.. if a movie makes me do that, in my standards.. its a good one. certain things could have been done better.. of course. i am damn sure that every director watching the final product says the same thing. but it just costs tons of money to go back and shoot a scene again.. that is understood. just to give a general idea from my side1: Loki is too weak.. and does not really pose a challenge. the main threat ends up being hordes of invaders 2: Thor launches a leaping blow with his hammer, and Cappy just blocks it with his shield causing a huge blast of sound waves.. well.. thats a bit silly :) but in the end, he is captain ""America"" isn't he !!!3: Thor falling down in the glass cage.. and seemingly that cage was designed to hurt Hulk who happily jumps down that high butt naked anyways.. well doesn't really add up.. 4:the gigantic flying craft .. well.. too much time spent around it, and its not really exciting or convincing at all.. i hoped that it wasn't used at all5: in the end Iron Man falling off the sky is quite a bit ""cliche"" but Hulk saving him saves the moment.. who ever thought of that ""bravo""maybe bits and pieces more. but not worth mentioningis this a great movie ? probably no.

2014-01-23,"Marvel's ""The Avengers"" is the cross-over movie that everyone was waiting for. All our favorite heroes (Iron Man, Captain America, The Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, and Hawkeye) are in one movie in order to stop the evil Loki. And it is perhaps one of the most critically loved and successful movies. And with good reason: the movie is incredibly amazing.For starters, the acting. Everything actor did a phenomenal job as their characters. Each actor (Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, etc.) defined their characters. So was the villain. Loki was completely evil and awesome. The dialogue should also be addressed. The dialogue was beautifully written for the characters, and it seemed believable because they really weren't friends (that would be a spoiler, but we all knew that would happen.) The action was the best I've seen in 2012. It was all shot well (the one-shot in the last two trailers was the best scene in the movie.) With the Hulk smashing, Thor using that cool hammer, 'Merica throwing his mighty shield, it was Christmas for moviegoers.In the end, what else is there to say that everyone else hasn't? ""The Avengers"" is cinematic gold at its finest. It was exciting, it was humorous, and it was just what 2012 needed for the Summer Movie season. This is a feeling we don't get in movies these days.

2019-04-24,"""Endgame"" prep began with me deciding to rewatch the three Avengers films starting with 2012's ""Avengers Assemble"" as it was called in the UK. I can't believe it was only 7 years ago, it seems like so much longer.Thanos (inexplicably, given what's to come) lends an infinity stone to Loki, so he can head to Earth and conquer it. In return, Loki will acquire the Tesseract, use it to transport his Chitari army across the galaxy and then, presumably, hand the stones over to Thanos. Following the loss of the Tesseract, Nick Fury instigates his Avengers Initiative program, pulling together some of the exceptional people known to SHIELD to form a response unit, to the threat of intergalactic war.Happily, ""AA"" still holds up really well. The effects are still strong, only one little scene of Captain America outside the Helicarrier clearly looking like a CGI stuntman and some weird scaling on Hulk in the final stare down with Loki. There are some awesome scenes in it, iconic even. Hulk chasing Black Widow down the corridor before leading into the fight with Thor, the ""Puny God"" moment and essentially the whole Chitari showdown battle.Character wise it's strong too. Starting some relationships that continue to pan out in the series. Friendships between Romanov and Banner and Stark and Banner. The immediate antagonism between the opposites of Stark and Rogers, but also starting Cap's distrust of organisations that would pay off in The Winters Soldier. The character whose probably least like he is now is Loki, much more vicious and condescending in this than he becomes... though even there, there are moments, between him and Thor.It's not a perfect film though, it does have quite a large block in the middle, between the capture of Loki and Barton's attack that feels a little draggy, again there's a lot of good character work here but compared to the later films it's a little slow. Though it has funny moments, it's obviously not as referential as the films could become later, when there were a few more of them.Though it's been superseded in quality over the years, ""Avengers Assemble"" remains a high point in the series and a real indicator of what a combined cinematic universe could offer.",8.0,2019-04,Wednesday,"2012:0.06, again:0.05, also:0.04, america:0.03, an:0.03, and:0.21, are:0.08, army:0.06, as:0.07, assemble:0.12, avengers:0.10, awesome:0.05, banner:0.09, battle:0.05, become:0.07, been:0.04, before:0.05, believe:0.06, between:0.19, black:0.04, but:0.04, can:0.06, captain:0.03, cgi:0.05, character:0.11, cinematic:0.06, come:0.04, could:0.08, does:0.04, down:0.11, earth:0.05, effects:0.04, even:0.07, feels:0.06, few:0.05, fight:0.05, film:0.03, films:0.12, final:0.06, funny:0.05, fury:0.05, given:0.06, god:0.05, good:0.03, has:0.03, have:0.03, he:0.10, here:0.05, high:0.05, him:0.05, his:0.07, hulk:0.06, in:0.20, into:0.04, is:0.04, it:0.24, least:0.06, like:0.09, little:0.14, loki:0.17, looking:0.06, lot:0.04, me:0.03, moment:0.06, moments:0.10, more:0.06, much:0.07, nick:0.05, not:0.05, now:0.05, of:0.18, off:0.05, on:0.03, one:0.03, only:0.07, out:0.03, over:0.09, people:0.04, perfect:0.05, point:0.06, probably:0.06, quite:0.05, real:0.06, really:0.03, scene:0.05, scenes:0.04, seems:0.06, series:0.12, so:0.06, some:0.13, stark:0.10, still:0.09, tesseract:0.13, than:0.04, that:0.06, the:0.46, them:0.04, then:0.04, there:0.15, this:0.02, thor:0.06, though:0.20, to:0.20, together:0.04, too:0.04, universe:0.06, up:0.03, was:0.05, well:0.03, were:0.04, what:0.06, when:0.04, whole:0.05, widow:0.04, will:0.03, with:0.09, work:0.05, would:0.04, years:0.10"
2019-05-19,"The marvel adventure could only go one way after the dismal Captain America, and thankfully things have got better! The combination of superheroes actually seemed to work for me, and the storyline was better than I expected. Clever that they've used a villain from another world and another movie...but does leave me wondering where the next Avenger film can go from here?!The most pleasing upgrade for me is the Incredible Hulk. From Ed Norton's boring and dull portrayal of this green monster...Mark Ruffalo has transformed this beast into an integral character with all sorts of edginess that keeps the viewer hooked! Ultimately though, once again the stand out actor is Mr Downey Junior himself, who just seems to get better with every marvel film he is in! The witty lines and the persona which he displays as Iron man is a joy to behold!With the storyline needing to be a little farfetched, Marvel have done well to keep it just this side of the line of reality! Whilst recognising that something extraordinarily and extravagant would be needed to bring these superheroes together, there are times in the film that it's in slight danger of crossing that line! Still...not bad at all in my book

2017-04-28,"One of the most entertaining blockbusters of all time, The Avengers may not have the perfection of the holy grail of comic-book adaptations, i.e. The Dark Knight trilogy or Logan, but its significant emphasis on perfect balance of humour & action throughout its runtime makes up for a highly rewarding experience that is far greater than what most films of its genre ever manage to come close to.Six Marvel superheroes in one movie, same save-the-world bullshit that we have seen & been disappointed with countless number of times and yet, The Avengers works in an unexpected but very effective manner and is bigger, better & far more amusing plus enjoyable than all the previous films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe combined, and succeeds in surpassing all hype & expectations with surprising but stunning ease.As for the plot summary, when the tesseract suddenly activates at the S.H.I.E.L.D. research facility and opens up a portal, allowing Loki, brother of Thor, to reach the Earth & begin his mission of enslaving the whole planet, Nick Fury (director of S.H.I.E.L.D.) reactivates the Avengers initiative, thus bringing Natasha Romanoff, Dr. Bruce Banner, Tony Stark & Steve Rogers together, who are later joined by Thor & Clint Barton, to stop Loki from succeeding with his plan.The direction is extremely good as Joss Whedon has crafted an impressive piece of eye-popping action extravaganza and, to make sure that the film is not overloaded & tiring, filled it up with loads of humour. The screenplay is witty plus the comic timing is brilliantly executed. Cinematography & Editing is carried out amazingly well. And the original score by Alan Silvestri is a major plus as it strikes the right chord from start to finish, thus enriching the whole experience.Coming to the performances, it's Robert Downey Jr. who delivers the strongest performance amongst all as Tony Stark/Iron Man and thanks to the amazing wit, charisma & charm this amazing actor always brings to the screen with finesse, it's almost impossible to not like him. Yet the one who manages to steal the show in the end is none other than Mark Ruffalo's terrific rendition of The Hulk for he was absolutely merciless & unstoppable and even Tom Hiddleston as Loki manage to impress with his chilling performance.On an overall scale, The Avengers is an ambitious adventure for the masses containing all the right ingredients of a genuine blockbuster material and the best thing about it is that nothing gets overdone as every element is present in its right dose, be it action, humour, drama etc. An astonishingly great initiative that will satisfy the majority of its viewers with its wildly entertaining, fun-filled, roller- coaster ride, this is the perfect popcorn entertainer for all ages.",9.0,2017-04,Friday,"about:0.03, absolutely:0.06, action:0.07, actor:0.05, all:0.12, almost:0.05, always:0.05, amazing:0.08, an:0.13, and:0.14, are:0.02, as:0.13, at:0.03, avengers:0.09, banner:0.04, be:0.02, been:0.03, best:0.03, better:0.04, blockbuster:0.05, book:0.04, brings:0.05, brother:0.05, bruce:0.04, but:0.06, by:0.06, cinematic:0.06, come:0.04, comic:0.07, coming:0.05, dark:0.05, director:0.04, disappointed:0.05, downey:0.03, earth:0.04, end:0.04, entertaining:0.09, even:0.03, ever:0.04, every:0.04, expectations:0.05, experience:0.11, far:0.09, film:0.02, films:0.07, for:0.10, from:0.05, fun:0.04, fury:0.04, genre:0.05, gets:0.05, good:0.03, great:0.03, has:0.03, have:0.05, he:0.03, hiddleston:0.04, highly:0.06, him:0.04, his:0.09, hulk:0.03, humour:0.18, hype:0.05, impressive:0.06, in:0.09, iron:0.03, is:0.22, it:0.10, its:0.21, joss:0.03, jr:0.04, knight:0.05, like:0.03, loki:0.09, make:0.04, makes:0.04, man:0.03, mark:0.04, marvel:0.05, may:0.05, more:0.03, most:0.07, movie:0.02, nick:0.04, not:0.07, nothing:0.04, of:0.25, on:0.05, one:0.07, or:0.03, original:0.06, other:0.03, out:0.03, overall:0.05, perfect:0.09, performance:0.11, performances:0.05, plot:0.04, previous:0.05, right:0.13, robert:0.03, ruffalo:0.04, same:0.04, save:0.05, screen:0.04, seen:0.04, show:0.05, stark:0.08, start:0.05, stop:0.05, superheroes:0.04, sure:0.05, tesseract:0.06, than:0.09, that:0.09, the:0.54, thing:0.04, this:0.03, thor:0.06, throughout:0.06, time:0.03, times:0.05, to:0.19, together:0.03, tom:0.04, tony:0.09, universe:0.05, up:0.09, very:0.03, was:0.02, we:0.04, well:0.03, what:0.03, whedon:0.03, when:0.03, who:0.09, whole:0.09, will:0.03, with:0.14, witty:0.06, world:0.04, yet:0.10"
2019-01-09,"Faced with an existential threat posed by Asgardian renegade Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles a team of ""Earth's mightiest heroes"", including Ironman, Thor, The Hulk, Captain America, Black Widow and Hawkeye (Robert Downey Jr. Chris Hemsworth Mark Ruffalo + CGI, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner respectively). Loki's plan revolves around possession of the Tesseract, the same glowing blue MacGuffin that plagued Captain America in his debut solo film ('Captain America: The First Avenger', 2001). The disparate team of egos and alter egos meets, squabbles, reconciles, and finally cooperates as the skies open and Loki's Chitauri army attacks the Big Apple. All of the heroes (super and otherwise) are well played and fun, and Tom Hiddleston is excellent as the conniving Loki. The overall story is entertaining and the film, especially the climactic battle, very well made.

2014-04-14,"The Avengers is a great movie, but not due to its plot. It's a simple MacGuffin chase, culminating in a random big fight. Also, the editing felt unfinished from time to time.Nevertheless... it's not the plot that is supposed to make the Avengers a great movie. It's the fact that it brings stories and characters from other movies together. In a way, the Avengers is the finale of a bigger whole.The lack of plot gives the opportunity to zoom into the different characters and how they respond to each other. We learn how Bruce Banner and Tony Stark connect. We see how The Hulk and Thor have a measurement of strength. How the straight morals of Captain America conflicts with the happy go lucky attitude of Iron Man.We also get a closer look at SHIELD and we learn that the agency has its moral questionabilities. When we move beyond the Avengers, we learn how that is so in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.The choice for Loki to be the main villain connects to the firs Avengers comic. And in many other ways as well , the movie pays its respect to the comics - as we're used to in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The Avengers movie is a mile stone in the MCU, and yes, its greatest merit is being the Avengers movie.It's not the plot that makes this movie great.

If anything The Avengers takes that label and runs with it all the way through its saving-the-world story.Does it need to be particularly deep? No. Is it an entertaining film that managed to get on by just fine before Spiderman's introduction to the MCU? Yes, absolutely. Cap, Thor, Hulk, Iron-Man, Black Widow and Nick Fury are great team players overall. I didn't count Hawk-Eye then because for some reason Jeremy Renner's portrayal just doesn't work for me.

2023-11-28,"...watches as in viewings, not the kind Christopher Walken sticks up his bum.I first watched Avengers 1 a while back having not seen any of the individual movies. I rated it a meh 5/10. Having no real connection to the characters or wider story arcs meant I was reliant on the spectacle, which without those anchors felt a little vapid.That's on me.Recently I got a Meta Quest 3 and have been blown away by 3D movies within that headset. The ridiculously large viewing screen fills the entire field-of-view, and is surprisingly comfortably so. 3D-depth is considerable at that size, and the isolation of the headset means you're all-in the movie. Immersive & highly-enjoyable experiences with the likes of Mad Max Fury Road, Dune, Jungle Book and Guardians of the Galaxy persuaded me to go through all the MCU Infinity Saga (so up to the end of Phase 3, plus Guardians III also). A buy-frenzy on Ebay/Amazon means I now have the 3D Blurays.First 5 Marvel flicks were mostly ok-to-good but nothing really great. While the criticism against modern CGI blockbusters is often valid: prioritising spectacle & franchise-recognisability over story-telling, what makes the Marvel movies so successful is the strength of their scripts and cast. This has been really apparent in my second watch of the first Avengers movie, which is the first of the Infinity Saga to bag a strong 8/10 score. Big improvement from the 5/10 I'd given it previously.The reason for the big jump is less the VR-Headset and more the viewer-familiarity of the characters. Anyone who's curious about these movies but doesn't feel like they have the time to go through them all are doing themselves - and the movies - a disservice. I used to feel that way, but watching the Avengers without really knowing who they are is an empty experience...might as well not watch them at all.If you have the time, or rather the motivation (like me discovering a fantastic new way to view movies) then I have to recommend you first watch the previous 5 MCU movies....yes, even including the painfully bad Hulk one. This way, Avengers 1 becomes a well-rounded experience! The fun spectacle is nicely balanced with character interactions & developments, making the viewer feel rewarded for having previous knowledge. This is a crucial angle I missed first time round, but appreciate much better now.The 3D itself is also the best so far: deeper, with even a few notable pop-outs (which in the massive VR screen look great). I also much more enjoyed the villain - Loki - on this second watch as this time I was armed with the previous Thor movie. On that note the main trio of Iron Man, Cap & Thor were also more enjoyable to follow.Next stop: Iron Man 3. It may well be a more middling movie, but now I understand the build-up is essential to the main events coming later in the saga. Like a good musical piece: it's paying attention to the build-up which makes the climax especially rewarding.",8.0,2023-11,Tuesday,"10:0.10, 3d:0.17, about:0.03, against:0.04, all:0.07, also:0.11, an:0.02, and:0.09, any:0.03, anyone:0.05, are:0.04, as:0.06, at:0.05, avengers:0.08, away:0.05, back:0.04, bad:0.04, be:0.02, been:0.06, best:0.03, better:0.03, big:0.06, book:0.03, but:0.09, by:0.02, cast:0.03, cgi:0.04, character:0.03, characters:0.05, coming:0.05, depth:0.05, doesn:0.04, end:0.04, enjoyed:0.04, entire:0.05, especially:0.04, even:0.06, experience:0.09, fantastic:0.04, far:0.04, feel:0.11, felt:0.04, few:0.04, first:0.17, for:0.03, franchise:0.05, from:0.02, fun:0.03, fury:0.03, given:0.04, go:0.06, good:0.05, got:0.04, great:0.05, has:0.02, have:0.10, having:0.13, highly:0.05, his:0.03, hulk:0.02, if:0.03, in:0.08, individual:0.05, iron:0.05, is:0.16, it:0.06, itself:0.05, kind:0.05, less:0.05, like:0.07, little:0.04, loki:0.03, look:0.04, main:0.08, makes:0.07, making:0.04, man:0.05, marvel:0.05, may:0.04, mcu:0.10, me:0.08, might:0.05, more:0.10, movie:0.06, movies:0.16, much:0.05, my:0.02, new:0.04, next:0.04, no:0.03, not:0.06, nothing:0.04, now:0.10, of:0.15, on:0.10, one:0.02, or:0.05, over:0.03, previous:0.12, rather:0.05, re:0.04, real:0.04, really:0.08, reason:0.05, recommend:0.05, screen:0.06, second:0.09, seen:0.03, so:0.09, stop:0.05, story:0.05, that:0.08, the:0.60, their:0.03, them:0.05, then:0.03, these:0.03, they:0.04, this:0.07, thor:0.05, those:0.04, through:0.08, time:0.10, to:0.17, understand:0.05, up:0.10, used:0.05, villain:0.04, was:0.04, watch:0.11, watched:0.04, watching:0.04, way:0.09, well:0.07, were:0.05, what:0.02, which:0.11, while:0.08, who:0.05, with:0.07, without:0.08, yes:0.05, you:0.06"

2015-01-07,"What can be said about the Avengers that can't be summed up by the poster? In case you've been living in another dimension, the past, or with the gods, you must have noticed that all the most recent Marvel films have been running side by side, setting the scene from something bigger. And this is it.The Avengers sees superheroes: Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, the Hulk, Hawkeye, Black Widow and Nick Fury come together to fight Thor's nasty brother - fellow God Loki.Just check the poster and promotional art out to see whether you think you'll like it. It's big, it's bold, it's explosive, it's special effects-laden and everything you've come to expect from a summer blockbuster. Apart from the fact that most summer blockbusters are simply special effects and a costly cinema admission. The Avengers is actually pretty damn good.The Avengers was released in the same years as Batman: The Dark Knight Rises and many people wondered whether there would be enough room for two such giant superhero movies. I would say yes, largely down to them being such different types of film. The Dark Knight is...well, much darker. It's not so brash and loud as the Avengers. Perhaps The Dark Knight is 'the thinking man's superhero movie?' Either way, if you want dark, moody and deep, Christopher Nolen's Batman will probably fit the bill. However, if you just want some pretty wicked action, great set-pieces and a bunch of people with superpowers knocking lumps out of each other in silly suits then delivering a witty quip or two, then The Avengers should keep you entertained for a couple of hours.People have argued that the superheroes don't receive equal screen time. Well, they nearly do, but you have to expect that Robert Downey Jr gets a little more screen time than his counterparts due to him being the biggest star in the film. But that should be a minor gripe.Bottom line: if you liked any of the previous Marvel superhero movies that this film is based on, then you will probably like this one.But, like I mentioned in the title, I'm guessing it will appeal mainly to young boys (or men like me who are still young boys at heart - and it has nothing to do with Scarlett Johannson in her catsuit... honest).",10.0,2015-01,Wednesday,"about:0.03, action:0.03, actually:0.05, all:0.02, america:0.03, and:0.17, another:0.05, any:0.04, are:0.05, as:0.05, at:0.03, avengers:0.15, batman:0.12, be:0.10, been:0.07, being:0.09, big:0.04, biggest:0.06, black:0.04, blockbuster:0.06, brother:0.05, but:0.07, by:0.06, can:0.06, captain:0.03, cinema:0.06, come:0.09, dark:0.20, different:0.05, do:0.08, don:0.04, down:0.05, downey:0.04, each:0.04, effects:0.08, enough:0.05, everything:0.05, expect:0.11, fact:0.06, fight:0.05, film:0.08, films:0.04, for:0.04, from:0.09, fury:0.04, gets:0.05, god:0.05, good:0.03, great:0.03, has:0.03, have:0.10, hawkeye:0.04, her:0.06, him:0.05, his:0.03, hours:0.06, however:0.05, hulk:0.03, if:0.10, in:0.14, iron:0.03, is:0.09, it:0.17, jr:0.04, just:0.06, keep:0.06, knight:0.17, like:0.11, liked:0.06, line:0.06, little:0.05, ll:0.06, loki:0.03, man:0.06, many:0.04, marvel:0.06, me:0.03, more:0.03, most:0.07, movie:0.02, movies:0.06, much:0.03, must:0.05, nick:0.05, not:0.02, nothing:0.05, of:0.09, on:0.03, one:0.02, or:0.10, other:0.03, out:0.06, past:0.06, people:0.13, pretty:0.10, previous:0.05, probably:0.11, robert:0.04, said:0.06, same:0.05, say:0.04, scarlett:0.05, scene:0.05, screen:0.08, see:0.03, set:0.06, should:0.09, simply:0.06, so:0.03, some:0.03, something:0.05, special:0.09, star:0.06, still:0.04, such:0.10, summer:0.12, superhero:0.11, superheroes:0.08, than:0.04, that:0.15, the:0.41, them:0.03, then:0.13, there:0.03, they:0.03, think:0.04, this:0.06, thor:0.06, time:0.06, to:0.14, together:0.04, two:0.10, up:0.03, ve:0.09, want:0.10, was:0.02, way:0.04, well:0.06, what:0.03, who:0.03, widow:0.04, will:0.10, with:0.07, witty:0.06, would:0.07, years:0.05, yes:0.06, you:0.28"

2019-07-27,"Iron Man. The Incredible Hulk. Iron Man 2. Thor. Captain America: The First Avenger. The Avengers is the ultimate culmination of all those movies, which ranged in quality from slightly above-average to excellent. In my review of the first Iron Man, I called it the pinnacle of Marvel cinema. It has now been topped. The story goes that after Captain America, the Tesseract ended up at the bottom of the ocean, and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and S.H.I.E.L.D. pulled it out. Now Loki (Tom Hiddleston) wants it, due to its inherently unlimited power, which will give him the ability to rule with an iron fist over all of Earth. Unless the Avengers can get past their differences and stop him. I have recently come to the opinion that director and screenplay heavily influence acting (this may be a bit late to realize this, but whatever). It certainly seems to be true in this case. Joss Whedon is apparently great fun to work with, and his writing talent is well-known. Both of these might be reasons why each actor performs better in this movie than in previous Marvel films. The highlights are Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., and Mark Ruffalo, each playing characters with hidden emotional depth that boils to the surface in the most commendable of ways (especially the latter actor, for obvious reasons). Though this trio leads the pack, said pack is composed entirely of very strong performances, something not usually seen in ensembles, but which Whedon pulls together with the greatest of ease. Joss Whedon originally signed on for this project in April of 2010. He threw out former writer Zak Penn's screenplay and replaced it with his own. No disrespect to Mr. Penn, but I sincerely doubt his version was better-written than this. Whedon's script shines brightly in nearly every conversation, each one punctuated with his trademark, never-miss humor. Another thing he is known for is the characterization he imbues his writing with. From Buffy to The Cabin in the Woods, Whedon has never created a character that is anything less than compelling, a rule that still applies, even to a cast as large and star-studded as this. Interestingly (and wisely), this doesn't feel like Joss Whedon's The Avengers. This really does feel like Marvel's The Avengers, with Joss's cherry on top. The characters still match perfectly with their prevous cinematic versions. The character development is so strong, in fact, that in battle, none of the characters feel like more superpowered thugs; they are actual people, fighting for their lives and humanity. Of course, superhero movies aren't usually known for their characters. The special effects department really outdoes itself in this film. From the nether regions of outer space to the showdown between Iron Man and Thor, visually the film never fails to dazzle. The action sequences are filmed and edited with a sort of grace, with Whedon's signature shaky-cam and midshot zooms thrown in occasionally for good measure. Unlike most movies, the action scenes are not edited in quick shots. The camera rotates around our heroes as they kick extraterrestrial ass, and various other techniques are employed to keep action shots as long as possible. Though unconventional, this ensures that the action is just as absorbing as the dialogue, and works well to this effect, allowing both of those aspects to support each other. This attribute is extremely hard to come by in movies, but where you can find it, treasure it. Upon leaving this film (which I only did after the final credits had rolled), many of those leaving with me were laughing and talking animatedly about this film, recalling various scenes and how the quality fared in relation to other comic book films. My opinion is that this is the second-greatest one of the bunch, second only to The Dark Knight (story and thematic depth beat witty banter and numerous explosions any day).

2012-11-16,"""The Avengers"" was a highly anticipated film. Something as epic as an ""all-star"" team of superheroes would be nothing less. Many, including myself, were doubtful that it could ever meet the high expectations. Still, millions of people perched in front of the big screen to watch it for the first time, and to many viewers' surprise, it surpassed expectations.""The Avengers"" is a glance in the bright direction that Marvel is walking. This film strings ""Captain America,"" ""Thor,"" ""The Incredible Hulk,"" and ""Iron Man,"" together, along with several sequels. A fresh breathe from generic remakes and love stories. This film includes several witty remarks by self-acclaimed ""genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist,"" Tony Stark, and the occasional physical humor that so many films attempt to do, but ""The Avengers"" blows out of the water.Marvel's wide array of characters makes it hard not to relate to one. They range from the egotistical genius and the modest genius with a serious anger issue, to the old-fashioned war hero and god-alien, although the last one may not quite fall into the category ""relatable,"" it displays the creativity and thought put into these characters.The casting in this movie simply couldn't have been done better. One may think that Robert Downey Jr. was made to play Iron Man, but many will say Iron Man was made to play Robert Downey Jr. If that doesn't say enough itself, the hard headed Nick Fury is played by the always brilliant Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Evans may make you believe he is actually a WWII veteran, Mark Ruffalo plays a mean Hulk even in comparison to Edward Norton, and that's only three. The list certainly goes on.The storyline is hard to complain about. A battle between some of our favorite superheroes and an army of aliens is pretty exciting to say the least. Selfish intentions and lack of teamwork override the team until they are provided motivation through a though loss and they rally together. The seemingly perfect squad reveals it's insecurities throughout the film, making them all the more relatable to the audience. The ending battle is incredible. First time watchers are probably going to be wide-eyed for the entire scene. A heated battle with flickers of comedy and adrenaline pumping fight scenes could not have been made any more awesome.If I had to make one complaint of this film, I would have to say the lines from the films are hits and misses, meaning sometimes they can be quite cheesy. It is a superhero movie and that may be expected, but ""We need a plan of attack"" ""I have a plan: attack"" made me chuckle and not necessarily in a good way. Another example resides in the same scene, where Captain America says ""There's only one God ma'am and I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that."" An additional complaint that can be made is the astonishing way that The Black Widow, who has no super powers, can jump off a spacecraft flying at high speeds and land safely, while stopping in a space of maybe 5 feet. But I suppose realism is not really the most desirable factor in a movie regarding a superhero-alien battle with gods and a flying aircraft carrier.""The Avengers"" is a classic film. I would never think ""The Dark Knight"" would have a film of its genre even come close for quite some time. For some, this film may surpass it.

2012-05-08,"This movie is rated as an 8.8 at the time of my writing this and I fully expect that to come down considerably now that all the fanboys (and girls) are finished pumping it up. The characters could spend 2 hrs napping and the fanboys would still give this movie a 9 or 10. It's like that with any movie franchise - those most predisposed to loving it are the first ones to see it and rave about it, as well as overlook the obvious faults.Now that the rest of us are going to see it (and review it) that rating will reflect what the movie really is: A CGI fest that's really kind of mediocre.

There's good chemistry between the heroes. 5. The action and special effects are pretty cool. 6. It has good pacing. The movie continues to build momentum towards a satisfying ending. 7. It develops a nice sense of fun and excitement.Average: 1. The acting and music were fine but nothing special.Cons: 1. Loki is an underwhelming villain (although often amusing). 2. The movie starts slow. 3. Some of the dialogue is pretty hokey (especially Fury's). 4. It lacks emotional impact or deeper meaning. 5. There are some dodgy plot holes. 6. It's not very original.Similarities to Transformers 3 (speaking of ""not very original""): 1. There are giant alien metal monsters smashing through buildings. 2. A portal is opened to another world from a tall building. 3. An alien army swarms in through this portal. 4. The good guys desperately try to close this portal. 5. There are evil flying, shooting, futuristic things. 6. A good guy steals one of these evil flying, shooting, futuristic things and uses it for good. 7. We see New York in a mess (cars upside down or on fire, dust and shrapnel everywhere, people screaming and running).In summary: The Avengers is impressive in the way it manages to hold itself together. Usually this many characters would be a guarantee of an awful movie. But here, somehow, all the heroes are given their chance to shine and it works pretty well.

2012-05-22,"STORY: Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D assembles a group of Marvel superheroes to stop Loki from using a device he stole to inevitably destroy the world. This really isn't treading any new ground as far as storytelling goes (I don't know how close it is to the comic). Yes the superheroes are all pretty cool but that's why they each have their own film. I feel that having all of them there didn't really allow for any development of the characters who all seemed to be competing for screen time. It was fairly unoriginal considering the films out there, an invading alien army comes to take over the world (by which I mean an alien army comes and invades America; the only place aliens ever seem to attack). I feel they tried to fit so much in that the story in general was entertaining but also seemed a bit rushed and not very original, as far as I could see it was something straight out of Hollywood. 2.5/5EXECUTION: The film was directed in the same way you would expect from this type of film. It had the epic explosive feel of a Michael Bay film (to be honest I thought he may have directed it until I saw the credits at the end). There were some pretty impressive action scenes which do enough to keep you watching right the way through, it was never boring for even a minute. However it was all very formulaic and the whole point of the film seemed to be to show off epic fights and to allow for cheesy lines from our heroes which come rapidly about every 5 minutes. The acting was actually pretty good. I'm not usually a fan of Robert Downey Jr. but he played his role very well. Samuel L Jackson did what he does best, playing the ""badass"" he's known for. The acting was definitely the best aspect of the film. 3.5/5VERDICT: It was okay, I went to see it with friends and we all thought it was a fun, solid action film. I just don't see what all the fuss is about. Everyone seemed to think it was spectacular, I don't know if this was due to the hype or if it was people who read the comics. I just can't say I thought it was anything special, which was disappointing (although I seem to be against the world on this one so don't just take my opinion).

2024-10-05,"The Avengers made movie history. For the first time three stars, each coming from their own successful solo movie(s), met in an epic crossover. This wasn't really a thing before. Sure you had sequels, prequels, spin-offs and the occasional guest appearance but never a huge connected universe like this.This experiment could have failed miserably as was demonstrated a few years later with Justice League but Marvel thankfully did put in the work to introduce and build up Iron Man, Thor and Captain America (and to a lesser extent, Hawkeye, Black Widow and Hulk) first, ensuring that we as the audience actually care for all of them.On the flip side this means, that The Avengers really doesn't stand well on its own feet. You could watch it as a stand alone movie and still somewhat enjoy it because the action is great but the whole plot is rather basic and without knowledge of at least some of previous movies it will feel quite confusing.

2017-11-30,"When the world is threatened by Loki who's determined to bring an army of evil-doers to Earth, a couple of superheroes are gathered together in order to form a team and defeat the upcoming invasion. The only thing that apparently stand in the way is their ego, each one of them having an idea of his own, while teamwork is a word which apparently they don't understand.It's a movie which features a great invasion of Earth while Ironman, Thor, Captain America and a couple of others must fight back to defeat it, and at the same time, struggle to work together as a team. It's one of those movies which amazes through its visuals, presents a good but overused plot in which MARVEL Superheroes show- off their powers while saving the world. As I said before, it looks astonishing, the characters are well described and put into picture, also very well played by their actors, the fighting sequences are top-notch and almost everything is very good. Of course, except the plot which simply wasn't enough to make it a masterpiece. It is good enough to make such a movie entertaining and sustainable, but not good enough to make it truly great. I like these kind of movies, where very popular characters with superpowers fight their way through saving the world, but it tends to be a bit boring to see how the world is attacked by a not so impressive force of evil, this time led by Loki (very well played but not so impressive as villain), over and over again. Oh, and as a result, the ending is very predictable. Something with a bit more depth could have helped a lot in terms of story. Yes, they tried to add a bit of additional suspense and even comedy through their opposing characters, almost making them fight each other, but it isn't enough from my point of view to make it a truly great movie.Overall, it's a must see for Marvel fans, for superhero fans and for everyone looking to have a good time.

This movies is nothing but a generic version of Batman Begins, and I say that one rather than Nolan's other two because, frankly, in my opinion, saying this a generic version of The Dark Knight or The Dark Knight Rises would make me go to hell for bad respect towards some of the best movies ever. Why can't Marvel fix their villain problems, Mandarin was terrible in Iron Man 3, especially that terrible twist. Anyways, I could continue, but you get my point.

2024-08-14,"A Cinematic Milestone
The Avengers was a cultural phenomenon that irrevocably altered the landscape of superhero cinema. Released in 2012, it marked the culmination of years of careful world-building within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), bringing together an ensemble of iconic characters for an epic showdown against an otherworldly threat.The film's impact is undeniable. It was a box office behemoth, shattering records and becoming a cultural touchstone. Its influence extended far beyond the silver screen, permeating popular culture and inspiring countless fans. But what truly sets The Avengers apart is its ability to transcend genre expectations and deliver a compelling narrative that resonates on multiple levels.A Masterclass in Ensemble Acting
One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its exceptional ensemble cast. Each actor brings their A-game, contributing to a dynamic and unforgettable group dynamic. Robert Downey Jr.'s charismatic portrayal of Iron Man serves as the perfect counterpoint to Chris Evans' stoic Captain America. Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner/Hulk is a complex and nuanced character, while Chris Hemsworth's Thor adds a touch of mythological grandeur. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is a lethal assassin with hidden depths, and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye is the grounded everyman of the group.The chemistry among the actors is palpable, creating a sense of camaraderie and shared purpose that is infectious. Their interactions are filled with wit, banter, and genuine affection, making it easy for audiences to root for this unlikely team. The film expertly balances individual character moments with the ensemble dynamic, allowing each character to shine while also contributing to the overall narrative.A Visual Spectacle
The Avengers is a feast for the eyes. The film's visual effects are groundbreaking, bringing to life iconic characters and epic battles with stunning realism. From the awe-inspiring scale of the Chitauri invasion to the intricate details of Iron Man's suits, the visual artistry is unparalleled.The action sequences are meticulously choreographed and executed, offering a thrilling blend of hand-to-hand combat, high-speed chases, and explosive set pieces. The Battle of New York is a cinematic masterpiece, showcasing the full power of the Avengers as they unite to protect the planet. The film's use of color and cinematography is also noteworthy, creating a visually striking and immersive experience.A Story That Resonates
Beyond its visual spectacle and stellar performances, The Avengers boasts a compelling narrative that explores themes of unity, sacrifice, and heroism. The film's central conflict is both personal and global, as the Avengers must come together to prevent the destruction of Earth while also confronting their own inner demons.The character arcs are well-developed, with each Avenger undergoing a transformation throughout the film. Iron Man, in particular, undergoes a significant character arc, evolving from a self-centered billionaire into a selfless hero. The film's exploration of themes of loss and grief adds depth and emotional resonance to the story, making the characters even more relatable.A Cultural Phenomenon
The Avengers was more than just a movie; it was a cultural event. The film's impact on popular culture is undeniable, spawning countless merchandise, video games, and comic books. It also paved the way for the interconnected universe of the MCU, which has become one of the most successful franchises in cinematic history.The film's success can be attributed to its ability to appeal to a wide audience. It combines the thrills of action cinema with the emotional depth of character-driven drama, making it accessible to both casual moviegoers and hardcore comic book fans. The Avengers is a testament to the power of storytelling and the enduring appeal of superheroes.Conclusion

2022-09-09,"This is a movie that changed what a generation expected to get out of movies. I actually thought the premise of combining a bunch of heroes into one film was the dumbest thing I had ever heard. I had really enjoyed Iron Man (2008) and Captain America (2011), but I hadn't enjoyed Thor (2011), I hadn't even seen Incredible Hulk (2008) because of how bad I heard it was, and I didn't really like Iron Man 2 (2010). But someone talked me into seeing this movie and paid for my ticket, and I politely agreed. I'll never forget being overwhelmed by the sense of how epic this movie was. The lines are unforgettable (especially by Nick Fury/Samuel L. Jackson), and the two distinct climactic battles are both completely satisfying. I now want movies to make me feel the way this movie made me feel. It is (largely) for my entire generation the definitive cinematic experience. The other thing that stands is my college professors complaining---in the most cliche way possible---that it ""didn't say anything about the human experience."" Man, those guys were overpaid.

His inner conflicts would make him a great anti-hero but the character relies on his logic to see the greater good. One of my favorite events is the death of Agent Coulson.

2016-04-03,"This is the perfect superhero film. You will not find much in the way of social comment (one bit about Loki & Nazis is a bit clunky), you will not find a great deal back-story or exploration of the depths of the characters. But this film doesn't need those it is awesome and it is fun! Striking the perfect balance between dark and light (in the pain vs fun sense) no time is wasted on introducing the heroes or the villains (it is assumed you know them already and of course you do)and the pacing is perfect. The action sequences are well done and pure comic book, there is no slacking in the pacing but you do not get a lot of the ""what-the-hell-jst-happened"" too fast to follow action . That is the essence of it, a comic brought to life in a way that you don't question. The balance of the characters is right too. Stark's smartass humour counterpoints Captain America's straight guy perfectly and the swaggering Thor goes well sided with the mild Banner and brutal Hulk. Hulk especially is someone who worries everyone in this, unpredictable yet necessary, he is a presence even when he isn't big and green. Sure there are some unbelievable bits, if I had taken even a fraction of the punishment Black Widow does whilst fighting the bad guys I would wind up dead or very injured at best and the consequence of actions taken is not always carried through but Hey!

2022-04-29,"It was no small secret, that the Marvel Cinematic Universe's (MCU's), whole intention of making an Iron Man film in 2008, would eventually lead to a film about The Avengers, which, interestingly enough, was the same evolution, that happened in the original comics in the 1960s. Sure, Spiderman had his own thing, the X-Men and the Fantastic Four had their own thing, but Stan Lee and his group needed to figure out what to do with the rest of Marvel's early original characters. Beginning in 1961, after the release of the first Fantastic Four comics, through the early 60s, eventually, popular titles, like The Incredible Hulk and Captain America had their own growing pains, mostly related to bad sales at the newsstands, plus reworking of titles or experimentation with other supporting characters. This even happened with Thor. The sales on his comic book were up and down too.In fact, Thor and the Hulk didn't even have their own named titles by the time the Avengers comics debuted in 1963. The Hulk's series ended with issue #6 and after bouncing around, guest starring in other titles, along with a brief time with the Avengers, he moved into the comic series Tales to Astonish in 1964. Astonish came with smaller stories for the Hulk, so he could share the book with Antman/Giant Man or Namor, the Submariner later on. In regards to Thor, he started right off the bat in the comic series Journey Into Mystery. He wouldn't get his own named title until 1966. Captain America would end up returning to comics by 1964. He debuted in the fourth Avengers issue. He wouldn't get his own named title until 1968. To solve some of these problems with the single characters, Marvel Comics decided it was time to bring these characters together into one title.So, just like the comics themselves, the MCU set forth with a plan for the film franchises, which started with 2008's Iron Man, starring Robert Downey JR. The films that followed featured the Hulk (Ed Norton and for this film, Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Captain America (Chris Evans). In the Avengers (2012), they bring the heroes together and add in the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson, who debuted in the second Iron Man in 2010) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner, who has a cameo in Thor (2011). There was no Antman or the Wasp yet in the MCU. It was too bad too, because they actually were original founding members of the Avengers in the comics. Along with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), an incredibly pieced together film is given to us by director, Joss Whedon. There are various other subplots going on throughout the film. The dialogue is believable, with many nice highlights for comic fans. It is a near perfect film, which also explains why it appealed to the average filmgoer. It is a perfect representation of what a comic book would look like if it came alive on film. In my estimation, it could be the best comic book film ever, even though there have been many contenders since 2012.9.4 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,2022-04,Friday,"2012:0.08, about:0.02, actually:0.04, after:0.06, along:0.08, also:0.03, america:0.07, an:0.04, and:0.12, are:0.02, around:0.04, at:0.02, avengers:0.10, bad:0.06, be:0.02, because:0.03, been:0.03, beginning:0.04, best:0.02, black:0.03, book:0.12, bring:0.09, but:0.02, by:0.07, came:0.08, captain:0.07, characters:0.08, chris:0.06, cinematic:0.04, comic:0.16, comics:0.25, could:0.05, dialogue:0.04, didn:0.03, director:0.03, do:0.03, down:0.04, downey:0.03, end:0.03, enough:0.03, evans:0.03, even:0.07, ever:0.03, fact:0.04, fans:0.03, fantastic:0.07, film:0.17, films:0.03, first:0.02, for:0.06, four:0.09, fury:0.03, get:0.05, given:0.04, going:0.03, group:0.04, had:0.07, has:0.02, have:0.04, hawkeye:0.03, he:0.14, hemsworth:0.03, heroes:0.03, his:0.12, hulk:0.10, if:0.02, imdb:0.05, in:0.26, incredible:0.03, into:0.08, iron:0.06, is:0.05, it:0.10, jackson:0.03, jeremy:0.04, johansson:0.03, joss:0.03, jr:0.03, just:0.02, like:0.06, look:0.04, making:0.04, man:0.08, many:0.06, mark:0.03, marvel:0.06, mcu:0.13, my:0.02, nice:0.04, nick:0.03, no:0.05, norton:0.04, of:0.09, off:0.03, on:0.07, one:0.02, or:0.07, original:0.13, other:0.07, out:0.02, own:0.20, perfect:0.07, renner:0.03, rest:0.04, right:0.03, robert:0.03, ruffalo:0.03, same:0.03, samuel:0.03, scarlett:0.03, second:0.04, series:0.12, set:0.04, since:0.04, single:0.04, so:0.04, some:0.02, sure:0.04, that:0.04, the:0.51, their:0.07, there:0.06, these:0.06, they:0.04, thing:0.07, this:0.03, thor:0.11, though:0.03, through:0.04, throughout:0.04, time:0.06, to:0.14, together:0.07, too:0.08, universe:0.04, until:0.08, up:0.04, us:0.04, was:0.08, were:0.05, what:0.04, whedon:0.03, which:0.08, who:0.05, whole:0.03, why:0.03, widow:0.03, with:0.20, would:0.07, yet:0.04"

2013-09-23,"From the beginning in the movie The Avengers there is an ongoing battle between an agency called S.H.I.E.L.D. and the evil Loki. After taking a staff with an unlimited amount of power called the Tesseract Loki planed on opening a portal to allow aliens to invade earth but the team S.H.I.E.L.D. had other plans and launched project Avengers. Recruiting the Marvel Super Heroes of earth: Iron Man a.k.a. Tony Starks, the Incredible Hulk a.k.a. Dr. Bruce Banner, Thor a.k.a. god of lightning, Captain America a.k.a. Steve Rodgers, Hawkeye a.k.a. Clinton Barton, and Black Widow a.k.a. Natalia Romanova to stop Loki and his alien army from taking over earth and possibly destroying it. I was impressed in how well they did in bringing all the characters together and connecting their story lines one way or another. A good example of how some the characters story line connected in the Avengers is Tony Starks a.k.a. Iron Man's dad was a great scientist/inventor. He was the genius that was able to turn Steve Rodgers into Captain America and giving him his powers by experimenting on him; making him into a great success. Tony knew very well about Captain America because of his dad telling stories about him. Years on down the road a scientist tried to recreate the experiment on Bruce Banner that was done to Steve Rodgers and gave him his powers but it went wrong causing him to change in to the Incredible Hulk When he gets angry. Thor's dad basically adopted Loki when he was a baby making Loki Thor's brothers. Thor was chosen by his dad to be the god of lightning and the protector of earth where all the Avengers live. All the characters had their own individual story line but somewhere in the line they connected to each other some more than others.The reason the Avengers were brought together was because Loki came through a portal in to the base of S.H.I.E.L.D. to take the powerful Tesseract so they made it their mission to recruit the Avengers to stop him from continuing with his plan. It wasn't easy convincing them but they all had their own motives as to why the thought they should help save the world. They had been keeping up with all the heroes without them know in case of a global emergency like this. Bruce asked Black Widow ""how did you find me?"" and she responded ""we never lost you we have been keeping up with you"". He was not real easy to convince to help but they really need him on their team. Iron man was not very hard to find but he found his own reasons to team up with the Avengers and save the world. After missing out on the first war he fought in Captain America did want to miss out on this battle so he was ready to fight with the team. Thor saw the evil his brother Loki was causing and decided to join the Avengers in a battle against him. That is how the Avengers got brought together after having their story lines cross.Before all the characters got together to become the Avengers they all had their own movie telling their own story line as to how they got their powers and got where they were. All their story lines crossed each other at some point some more than others but at the end they all got brought together by team S.H.I.E.L.D. The epic battle of having to stop the evil Loki and his alien army from taking over earth is what brought all the heroes together at the end of it all. Even though some of the stories were connecting more than others they all got connected by the battle equally with each character having their own role.

2012-09-25,"I was anticipating this film so much. I am not one to rush to see a film the day of release, as I'd rather watch it alone in an empty cinema. A few bated weeks past and I decided it was time to see the film everyone was describing as 'The best film they had ever seen'. Unlikely. I began to watch the film, in an almost empty cinema and found myself bored. I laughed at parts that were not meant to be laughed at and the supposed comedy just left me confused. I made a decision, and walked out of the film half way through. Unsure as to whether the huge hype had just made the film a complete let-down, I decided to give it another chance when it was released on DVD. I realised where the film had gone wrong. As a Marvel fan, I knew the back story, the characters and previous movie plots. However the Avengers failed to explain any of this. No character development what so ever, and although I was aware of the story, I found myself having to wrack my brain to remember things from the comics. The film is just another generic superhero movie. Nothing new, nothing special. I realise this is an unconventional view, but I feel that a lot of people would have enjoyed it because they felt they had to.

2014-09-08,"Superhero movies have been the craze for a while now. Sure, they've always been around, but now they seem to be coming out in droves. Either a new hero to make a movie for, yet another sequel to an existing series (Batman 1-3, Spiderman 1-3, Amazing Spiderman 1-2, Iron Man 1-3, Captain America 1-2, Thor 1-2, and the extensive X-Men series to name a few), or another reboot. Yes, they are popular, but for the most part extremely formulaic. Other than Nolan's Batman series there is not much new in any of those movies, and the Avengers is no different. Maybe even worse.Everything you expect to see in the Avengers, you will see. Some snappy one-liners from Downey Jr., explosions, an excessive use of CGI, good guys win, bad guys lose, dot dot dot. I think I've seen this one before. There is no creativity, no thought, nothing really. If you enjoy movies that require no thought, this one is for you.And the hype? I put this up there with the Fast & the Furious, it's THAT bad, yet so many people seem to love it. Are we really that unimaginative and dull? It's only exciting if you can't see past the CGI and battle scenes.If you would like to watch a 'superhero' movie with actual substance, Watchmen is a terrific example, they are the 'anti-Avengers' if you will.

2013-04-06,"Team of a Lifetime The Avengers is not just a film- it is a well thought out story. However, the background of Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man 2, are almost mandatory prior to watching, or The Avengers will make no sense, and possibly bore you to death. The combination of five different films, introducing us to different characters and stories, turns this movie into reality. Throughout the different Marvel films, there was question to whether the writer/director, Joss Whedon, was going to follow through with his previous productions and deliver a film that lives up to the fans' expectations.The Avengers is, without a doubt, classified as a science fiction movie filled with countless amounts of action and comic book references. The Avengers is made up of an assortment of intense music, ambitious characters, fast-paced plotting, special effects, rivalry between the hero and villain, and suspense. According to Marvel fans, this movie, by far, sky rockets their expectations.The complex movie begins with Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye, and Black Widow, all teaming up and creating the Super Hero team of a lifetime. When an unexpected enemy emerges and threatens global safety and security, Nick Fury, the director of the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D, finds himself in need of a phenomenal team to save the world from disaster. Therefore, a daring span of recruitment begins. However, once brought together, the Avengers struggle to trust each other and work as a team. Meanwhile, in previous movies the super heroes were forced to work individually. Therefore, the film's theme arises when the outsiders start to realize that by using their outstanding super powers and working as a team, they are capable of becoming something great, and in this case capable of saving the world from Thor's adopted brother, Loki. Loki has characterizes of each superhero he is facing; therefore, it takes the teamwork of each superhero to defeat the Loki.It would be unfair to focus solely on the positives when negatives do exist in The Avengers. It seems as though Joss Whedon focused more on the battles and special effects in the movie, then on the actual background and explanation of defining the characters. Without the additional background of the prior films, The Avengers seems to be confusing. The two and a half hour movie almost needed to be stretched out to a three hour movie in order to include all of the important background information to get the movie off to a better start, and to make more sense to viewers who have not seen the background films. Besides, with the lack of character explanation, the film has a rushed feeling, and can become rather confusing.",8.0,2013-04,Saturday,"action:0.02, all:0.04, almost:0.09, america:0.05, an:0.05, and:0.27, are:0.04, as:0.08, avengers:0.14, be:0.07, become:0.05, better:0.03, between:0.04, black:0.03, book:0.04, brother:0.05, brought:0.05, by:0.05, can:0.03, captain:0.06, character:0.03, characters:0.07, comic:0.03, different:0.13, director:0.08, do:0.03, each:0.10, effects:0.06, expectations:0.09, fans:0.08, far:0.04, film:0.09, films:0.13, from:0.05, fury:0.04, get:0.03, going:0.04, great:0.03, half:0.05, has:0.05, have:0.02, hawkeye:0.04, he:0.03, hero:0.08, heroes:0.03, his:0.03, hour:0.11, however:0.09, hulk:0.02, in:0.10, incredible:0.04, into:0.03, iron:0.05, is:0.08, it:0.06, joss:0.06, just:0.02, loki:0.09, made:0.03, make:0.07, man:0.05, marvel:0.05, more:0.05, movie:0.14, movies:0.03, need:0.05, nick:0.04, no:0.03, not:0.04, of:0.27, off:0.04, on:0.07, once:0.05, or:0.03, other:0.03, out:0.05, powers:0.05, previous:0.09, rather:0.05, save:0.05, seems:0.10, seen:0.03, sense:0.10, something:0.04, special:0.07, start:0.09, story:0.03, super:0.11, superhero:0.06, takes:0.05, team:0.18, that:0.03, the:0.53, their:0.06, then:0.04, there:0.03, they:0.02, this:0.05, thor:0.08, though:0.04, thought:0.04, through:0.04, throughout:0.05, to:0.32, together:0.03, two:0.04, up:0.08, us:0.05, villain:0.04, was:0.04, watching:0.04, well:0.03, were:0.03, whedon:0.06, when:0.09, who:0.03, widow:0.03, will:0.03, with:0.08, without:0.08, work:0.08, world:0.07, would:0.03, you:0.02"

2012-11-18,"Since Iron Man and the post-credits scene of The Incredible Hulk, we were infatuated with the idea of Earth's Mightiest Hero's assembling onto the big screen. As more Marvel movies featuring the members of The Avengers as main characters in their own self-titled movies were released, more hints towards an Avengers movie came out. Foreshadowing events such as Agent Phil Coulsen talking to Pepper Potts about S.H.I.E.L.D., or Captain America being found in the ice after the events of Captain America: The First Avenger. Such hints kept people in suspense until it was finally announced that there would be a Marvel's The Avengers movie.The choice of Joss Whedon as director could not have been a better fit. Half of this movie is centered on the character interaction, and anybody who has followed shows such as Firefly or Buffy the Vampire Slayer knows that Whedon can exploit the dynamics of a team, as well as the volatile components that come with putting a group of people together with different attitudes and viewpoints. Scenes such as the arguments that members of The Avengers get into aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier are just as entertaining as when they are on the streets of New York fighting Loki and the Chitauri.Part of the reason I feel that this movie was so successful is that Joss Whedon did not try and tie a stupid love story into it. Other than the established relationship between Black Widow and Hawkeye, there is no mushy love dynamic to the plot. This helps give more screen-time for things such as inter-colleague fighting, like that of Thor vs. The Hulk. The only flaws with this movie is the inevitable under use of a character, in this case, it is Hawkeye. With a film like this, the only way to keep it from being four hours long is to cut out some scenes with some characters. Looks like Jeremy Renner drew the short straw on this one, after only making a cameo appearance in Thor. Also, the plot of the movie is pretty cut-and-dry. Loki wants to take over Earth and The Avengers must stop him. There isn't really much else to it.However, I find that the amount of awesomeness packed into the battle scenes of this movie more than make up for this. From the two on one fight of Captain America and Iron Man vs. Thor, which levels part of a forest, to the Hulk thrashing Loki around the room, the action in this movie keeps a grin on your face. Whedon knew which fights could be epic, and he made them epic. He also demonstrates some of the more subtle abilities of The Avengers such as Hulk catching the pilot trying to bail out of his jet (a nod to the Hulk's super reflexes) or Captain America using his gymnastic skills to move across the damaged helicarrier.Joss Whedon has set the standard for the following Marvel movies, and the sequel hinted to at post-credits with Thanos and his evil grin. The bar is set high, and with movies such as Ant-Man and Captain America 2 coming out, it will be interesting to see where they take each members stories and set them up for the following Avengers movie.",9.0,2012-11,Sunday,"about:0.02, action:0.02, after:0.06, agent:0.05, also:0.05, america:0.11, amount:0.04, an:0.02, and:0.18, are:0.04, around:0.04, as:0.22, at:0.02, avenger:0.04, avengers:0.12, battle:0.04, be:0.05, been:0.03, being:0.06, better:0.03, between:0.03, big:0.03, black:0.03, came:0.04, can:0.02, captain:0.11, character:0.05, characters:0.04, come:0.03, coming:0.04, could:0.06, credits:0.09, did:0.03, different:0.04, director:0.03, each:0.03, earth:0.07, else:0.04, entertaining:0.03, epic:0.08, evil:0.04, face:0.05, feel:0.03, fight:0.03, fighting:0.08, film:0.02, finally:0.04, find:0.04, first:0.03, for:0.06, found:0.04, four:0.05, from:0.04, get:0.03, give:0.03, group:0.04, half:0.04, has:0.04, have:0.02, hawkeye:0.06, he:0.05, hero:0.03, high:0.04, him:0.03, his:0.07, hours:0.04, however:0.04, hulk:0.10, idea:0.04, in:0.08, incredible:0.03, interesting:0.04, into:0.08, iron:0.04, is:0.10, isn:0.04, it:0.08, jeremy:0.04, joss:0.08, just:0.02, keep:0.04, like:0.06, loki:0.07, long:0.03, looks:0.04, love:0.07, made:0.03, main:0.04, make:0.03, making:0.04, man:0.06, marvel:0.06, more:0.11, movie:0.13, movies:0.08, much:0.02, must:0.03, new:0.03, no:0.03, not:0.03, of:0.26, on:0.09, one:0.03, only:0.08, or:0.07, other:0.02, out:0.09, over:0.03, own:0.03, packed:0.04, part:0.07, people:0.06, plot:0.06, pretty:0.04, really:0.02, reason:0.04, renner:0.03, scene:0.03, scenes:0.08, screen:0.06, see:0.02, sequel:0.04, set:0.12, short:0.04, since:0.04, so:0.02, some:0.07, stop:0.04, story:0.02, such:0.24, super:0.03, take:0.07, team:0.03, than:0.05, that:0.12, the:0.55, their:0.02, them:0.05, there:0.06, they:0.04, things:0.04, this:0.13, thor:0.06, time:0.02, to:0.15, together:0.02, two:0.03, until:0.04, up:0.04, wants:0.05, was:0.03, way:0.03, we:0.03, well:0.02, were:0.05, whedon:0.13, when:0.02, where:0.03, which:0.05, who:0.02, widow:0.03, will:0.02, with:0.13, would:0.02, york:0.04, your:0.03"
2013-04-17,"THE AVENGERS ASSEMBLEI had seen this film when it came out in the cinema and I was blown away. I thought it was awesome.I watched it for a second time yesterday and felt the same way it is such a great film and well put together.I had seen all of the original films about the characters and I had mixed reviews about them.Captain America = I didn't like it.Thor = I thought it was good.Iron Man = I loved it.Iron Man 2 = I liked it, just not as much as the first one.The Incredible Hulk = I liked it.But put them together and you have an amazing film.The story was good, the action was great, the characters were great and the actors were great.Everyone did a good job but for me the main character and star was Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man.A lot of people thought the Hulk was the best character, and he was great but there is just something about Iron Man that I think is special.Besides, I like RDJ I think he is a great actor.I was a little bit confused as to why someone different played Bruce Banner/Hulk I was expecting Edward Norton to reprise his role from The Incredible Hulk.I still don't know why he didn't do it.Robert Downey Jr., Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson & Jeremy Renner all make a great team.Since this film was released, news has broken that there will be a lot of sequels on the way. Thor 2, Captain America 2 and Iron Man 3 to name a few.Then in 2015 there will be The Avengers 2.There are some great comedy moments in this movie too. Hulk is the main character that made me laugh. He just doesn't care about anyone and his actions make good comedy at times.The success of this film really has boosted the comic to film transition. Man of Steel comes out this year and there are a lot more Marvel & DC comics coming to the big screen.I am a super-hero fan, (in the movies I never read the comics) so for me this is only good news. I just hope they don't ruin any of the classic characters.I will give this film 8 out of 10.It is better than all of the individual movies and I can't wait for the sequel in 2015.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8.0,2013-04,Wednesday,"10:0.04, about:0.12, action:0.02, actor:0.05, actors:0.04, all:0.06, am:0.04, amazing:0.04, america:0.06, an:0.03, and:0.18, any:0.04, anyone:0.05, are:0.05, as:0.09, at:0.03, avengers:0.04, away:0.05, awesome:0.04, banner:0.04, be:0.05, best:0.03, better:0.04, big:0.04, bit:0.04, bruce:0.04, but:0.06, came:0.05, can:0.03, captain:0.06, care:0.06, character:0.09, characters:0.08, chris:0.08, cinema:0.05, comedy:0.11, comes:0.05, comic:0.03, comics:0.09, coming:0.05, did:0.04, didn:0.08, different:0.05, do:0.04, doesn:0.05, don:0.07, downey:0.07, evans:0.04, everyone:0.04, fan:0.04, felt:0.05, few:0.04, film:0.17, films:0.04, first:0.03, for:0.10, from:0.03, give:0.04, good:0.13, great:0.22, had:0.10, has:0.05, have:0.02, he:0.12, hemsworth:0.04, hero:0.04, his:0.06, hope:0.06, hulk:0.12, in:0.09, incredible:0.09, individual:0.06, iron:0.13, is:0.12, it:0.18, jackson:0.04, jeremy:0.05, job:0.04, johansson:0.04, jr:0.07, just:0.10, know:0.04, like:0.08, liked:0.11, little:0.04, lot:0.12, loved:0.05, made:0.03, main:0.10, make:0.07, man:0.16, mark:0.04, marvel:0.03, me:0.09, moments:0.04, more:0.06, movie:0.04, movies:0.05, much:0.03, my:0.03, never:0.04, norton:0.05, not:0.02, of:0.13, on:0.02, one:0.02, only:0.03, original:0.06, out:0.08, people:0.04, played:0.05, put:0.09, read:0.06, really:0.03, renner:0.04, reviews:0.17, robert:0.07, role:0.05, ruffalo:0.04, same:0.04, samuel:0.04, scarlett:0.04, screen:0.04, second:0.05, seen:0.07, sequel:0.05, since:0.05, so:0.03, some:0.03, something:0.04, special:0.04, star:0.05, still:0.04, story:0.03, such:0.04, super:0.04, team:0.04, than:0.03, that:0.06, the:0.39, them:0.06, then:0.04, there:0.13, they:0.03, think:0.07, this:0.12, thor:0.06, thought:0.13, time:0.03, times:0.05, to:0.08, together:0.06, too:0.04, wait:0.05, was:0.23, watched:0.05, way:0.07, well:0.03, were:0.06, when:0.03, why:0.09, will:0.09, year:0.05, you:0.02"
2012-12-11,"The only reason I walked into the screening because of its ridiculous hype even by the most trusted critics beyond that even the featurette or trailers did not interest me at all. I felt like I watched something out of a kids happy meal and if we are going to expect movies like these in future receiving undeserving acclaim and astounding attention, then I guess it is indeed an offense of naming and giving out Razzberry awards. As I would believe that there are movies with poor reception to be actually highly underrated. The movie starts off with a lousy science experiment at one of the S.H.I.E.L.Ds lab where a portal opens up allowing Loki from an alternate universe to pop in and to begin with his agenda of destruction and dominance. In response to the threat the director of S.H.I.E.L.D Nick fury opens up the Avenger's initiative which has all the super humans or superheroes to team up for you know what. The movie is a cocktail of a lousy plot, poor acting( except for Robert Downey Jr whose presence in the film made it tolerable to some extent). Worst of all it was Samuel l Jackson in his role as the director of S.H.I.E.L.D, Nick fury. I seriously had a problem of tolerating his presence on screen with his unethical portrayal of his character. He only wouldn't be the sole perpetrator, as everyone else(except for Robert again) also portrayed their respective roles like they were starring in some sort of parody of the original. Praise would go to the visual effects and the action sequences which I don't think it is much of a giant leap for mankind in the present date with a good budget of 250 million!, well of course hats off to the animators and sfx designers who did an excellent job to save the sinking boat, at least making it an visual spectacle. The movie is strictly for kids who would certainly enjoy it. So if you are thinking of spending some time out with your kids for the weekend .

2013-04-03,"This film is not only spectacular but its an ""historic"" superhero feature film at its best. This is worth the wait. Hell, this was worth the wait many years ago when it was first developed. This is something what has NEVER been done before & Marvel has got there finger on the pulse. In 1998, a minor marvel character featuring a human/vampire hybrid made it way to the big screen. In 2000, a group of mutants evolved into the box office. In 2002, was the year of the Spider.After Daredevil, Hulk (Ang Lee), The Punisher, Elektra, Man-Thing, Fantastic Four & Ghost Rider, Marvel Studios would start producing its own films and distribute them through Paramount Pictures & the funding will come from a seven-year, $525 million revolving credit facility with Merrill Lynch. The result led to the creation of the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"". Sounds cool, right? It was. No, really, It F***in' was. Iron Man made its motion picture debut, The Hulk got rebooted, Thor & Captain America have ""FINALLY"" got the Big screen treatment. Then came a huge shift in the Marvel universe.... Marvel Entertainment is now owned by Mickey Mouse. Amazing. Disney let go the Power Rangers franchise & bought Marvel.But after everything from comics to TV & film Marvel has put out it comes to show just how far they come as a company & knowing the fact that the biggest supporters (including me) are the fans. That is why they CAN NOT Disappoint us. Yeah, we complain about story lines, costumes & special effects, But if they stay true to the comics, the films would have done its justice. But i know deep down, Marvel Studios will always put out films & stay close to the material. So, what i've said earlier, was it worth the wait? Yes. Yes it was ""definitely"" worth it.Marvel Studios, the cast & crew of The Avengers did an amazing job & on the Marvel Cinematic Universe & i can't wait to see what comes next. Now if DC & Warner Bros. can step their game up, we would like to see the Justice League into the big screen.",10.0,2013-04,Wednesday,"about:0.03, after:0.08, always:0.05, amazing:0.09, america:0.03, an:0.06, and:0.02, are:0.03, as:0.02, at:0.03, avengers:0.02, been:0.04, before:0.05, best:0.03, big:0.12, biggest:0.06, but:0.09, by:0.03, came:0.06, can:0.09, captain:0.03, cast:0.04, character:0.03, cinematic:0.12, come:0.08, comes:0.11, comics:0.10, cool:0.06, definitely:0.05, did:0.04, done:0.09, down:0.05, effects:0.04, entertainment:0.06, everything:0.05, fact:0.06, fans:0.05, fantastic:0.05, far:0.05, film:0.08, films:0.12, finally:0.05, first:0.04, four:0.07, franchise:0.06, from:0.06, go:0.04, got:0.15, group:0.06, has:0.09, have:0.05, how:0.04, huge:0.05, hulk:0.05, if:0.06, in:0.10, into:0.08, iron:0.03, is:0.09, it:0.14, its:0.19, job:0.05, just:0.03, know:0.04, let:0.05, like:0.03, lines:0.06, made:0.07, man:0.06, many:0.04, marvel:0.33, me:0.03, never:0.04, next:0.06, no:0.04, not:0.05, now:0.09, of:0.07, on:0.05, only:0.04, out:0.06, own:0.05, power:0.06, put:0.10, really:0.03, right:0.05, said:0.05, screen:0.12, see:0.06, show:0.05, so:0.03, something:0.05, special:0.04, spectacular:0.06, start:0.06, story:0.03, superhero:0.03, that:0.04, the:0.45, their:0.03, them:0.03, then:0.04, there:0.03, they:0.08, thing:0.05, this:0.07, thor:0.03, through:0.05, to:0.14, true:0.06, universe:0.16, up:0.03, us:0.05, ve:0.04, wait:0.23, was:0.16, way:0.04, we:0.08, what:0.09, when:0.03, why:0.05, will:0.06, with:0.02, worth:0.21, would:0.10, year:0.11, years:0.05, yes:0.11"
2020-05-18,"Marvel started the MCU with it's first movie Iron Man back in 2008 but up until that point Marvel wasn't really on the radar for good comic book movies failing with every movie they put out in the early and mid 2000s from Fantastic Four, Ghost Rider, The Punisher, Daredevil, Electra the list goes on but that all changed with Iron Man and the creation of the MCU idea a series of movies that would build a roster of Superheros and Hero's from the ground up giving the main Avengers Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and Hulk their own separate movies to develop their characters and story as the time line moved forward and finally after five movies and over four years of waiting Marvel brought together the Avengers for their first team up and while all the movies in the MCU before this had made a massive profit and were loved by fans Avengers Assemble was Marvels biggest movie success that broke box office records achieved stellar reviews by both fans and critics and even after all the movies that came after it Avengers Assemble is still to this day one of the best comic book movies ever made giving die hard fans what they always wanted from their favourite comic book characters and creating a whole new generation of comic book fans that still continues to grow in 2020.I really loved how the lesser known characters who were just cameos in the previous movies like Hawkeye and Black Widow got their chance to shine and evolve in this movie for example in Iron Man 2 Black Widow didn't do anything until the last 10 minutes of the movie and her character was very under developed same with Hawkeye in Thor he only got three lines and didn't even get to fire a single arrow at the time I was worried this is what was gunna happen to the none superhero characters that don't have their own movies but to Marvels credit they gave each character appropriate screen time and showed off just how badass Hawkeye and Black Widow can be and we got more character development and defined personalitys that make them the awsome characters they always have been.The special effects and CGI is spectacular in this movie and really makes you appreciate just how amazing modern day movies with CGI and green screens can look when done right.I highly recommend watching this movie if your a comic book and MCU fan even if your not and your just looking for a cool action movie to watch it's fun and badass.",9.0,2020-05,Monday,"10:0.04, action:0.02, after:0.10, all:0.06, always:0.09, amazing:0.04, america:0.03, and:0.37, anything:0.04, as:0.02, assemble:0.10, at:0.02, avengers:0.08, back:0.04, be:0.02, been:0.03, before:0.04, best:0.03, biggest:0.05, black:0.10, book:0.18, both:0.05, brought:0.05, but:0.05, by:0.05, came:0.05, can:0.05, captain:0.03, cgi:0.08, character:0.08, characters:0.12, comic:0.16, cool:0.05, day:0.10, development:0.05, didn:0.08, do:0.03, don:0.03, done:0.04, each:0.03, effects:0.03, even:0.09, ever:0.03, every:0.03, fan:0.04, fans:0.16, fantastic:0.04, finally:0.04, first:0.06, for:0.07, four:0.11, from:0.07, fun:0.04, get:0.03, giving:0.10, goes:0.05, good:0.02, got:0.13, had:0.03, hard:0.04, have:0.04, hawkeye:0.10, he:0.03, her:0.05, hero:0.04, highly:0.05, how:0.09, hulk:0.02, idea:0.05, if:0.05, in:0.15, iron:0.10, is:0.05, it:0.05, just:0.10, last:0.04, like:0.02, line:0.05, lines:0.05, look:0.04, looking:0.05, loved:0.09, made:0.06, main:0.04, make:0.03, makes:0.04, man:0.10, marvel:0.08, mcu:0.20, minutes:0.05, more:0.03, movie:0.13, movies:0.25, new:0.04, not:0.02, of:0.10, off:0.04, on:0.04, one:0.02, only:0.03, out:0.03, over:0.03, own:0.08, point:0.05, previous:0.04, put:0.04, really:0.08, recommend:0.05, reviews:0.05, right:0.04, same:0.04, screen:0.03, series:0.05, single:0.05, special:0.04, spectacular:0.05, still:0.07, story:0.03, superhero:0.03, team:0.03, that:0.14, the:0.32, their:0.16, them:0.03, they:0.09, this:0.09, thor:0.05, time:0.08, to:0.12, together:0.03, until:0.10, up:0.08, very:0.03, was:0.08, wasn:0.05, watch:0.03, watching:0.04, we:0.03, were:0.06, what:0.05, when:0.03, while:0.04, who:0.03, whole:0.04, widow:0.10, with:0.09, would:0.03, years:0.04, you:0.02, your:0.11"
2020-02-06,"+ Some really nice overall cinematography, even small scenes or FX heavy scenes look good. Even if it sets the series on a path of a fairly plain visual tone.
+ Also for better and worse has the plot of a Saturday morning cartoon which means it's convoluted and painfully simple at the same time.
+ Effects still hold up. Particularly Iron Man.
+ The way the title card comes in is a stroke of genius.
+ Ruffalo plays a pleasant to watch, snarky, smarmy smart guy who's so angry that he's a dick to everyone. It's a good choice even if he's a bit wrong for the role.
+ Powers booth!
+ Effortless and pleasurable connective tissue in the opening recruitment scenes.
+ Cool de-suiting at stark towers.
+ Stark with Potts is a good combination, great chemistry and I want to see more.
+Coulson nerding out is funny still.
+ There is a plethora of excellent dialogue and refreshing takes on the tropes.
+ All the super fights are excellently choreographed slices of comic book action. No battle fatigue, inventive etc., even in the third act.
+ ""He's adopted?""
+ Science bros.
+ Dialogue really flows well, feels organic, important and full of character layers. The repartee particularly between Tony and Cap feels tense and equal and riveting at times.
+ Good use of aspect ratio. Appropriate.
+ Having to explain the nerd stuff to someone who enjoys it anyway means it hits both ways.
+ Much better than I remember. It has aged well.
+ Good closing shot.Gift and curse of Whedon's dialogue is that sometimes it's brilliant and sometimes it's awfully cringeworthy.Some wonky or hacky directing.Sort of lame opening chunks before the team assembling.I just don't like Sam Jackson unless he's playing Sam Jackson. Here he's not. He's playing sneaky, grumpy Mace Windu in an eyepatch.Faceless, generic, blue-blooded fodder enemies.Quintessential sky-beam blockbuster third act.Early Post-Credits sequence review: 2/5: Thanos' reveal. Christ, I remember not knowing anything about this guy at the time. He looks ropey and doesn't say anything. Hard to love.

2012-11-20,"Honestly, maybe it's better to go watch some cartoon series The Avengers or read some comic books about them, then watch this movie!! So much flashing scenes, flat and undeveloped characters, dull conversions that after half of movie you really start think how can someone glorify this piece of c**p! Only good thing is surprisingly solid performance of Cobie Smulders and Tom Hiddleston and really good last action fighting scene (even if it's unconvincing and completely transparent), that I luckily didn't sleep over. General observation was be that this kind of blockbusters must have really great and very well elaborated scenery that will naturally lead watcher from individual rampage to team assembly of world greatest heroes (The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes cartoon series showed how to do that in just 90 min). Hulk is completely lost, Captain America is to plastic, Iron Man is working his daily shift, Thor looks like some intruder on private party and Nick Fury is completely clueless what to do, but still everything turns up fine.

2012-07-31,"The midnight premiere of ""The Avengers"" in Doha filled every seat in the theatre. One ticket for six heroes deals like this don't come very often.Co-writer and director Joss Whedon delivers one of this year's most highly anticipated films, Marvel's ""The Avengers."" By bringing together the cream of ""The Avengers"" crop, including the mighty ""Incredible Hulk,"" the cool-as-steel ""Iron Man,"" dashing ""Captain America,"" ""Thor"" and his magic hammer, slick ""Black Widow"" and master archer ""Hawkeye,"" has met all expectations in combining the real world with Marvel-style myth.An opened space portal, a la ""Thor,"" launches us into this new adventure. It is the bridge between the two worlds from which the exiled semi-God Loki (Tom Hiddleston) steps through. His mission is to conquer the Earth with the support of the dark alien army of the Chitauri, in exchange of the Tesseract, a powerful energy source. His abilities, to control minds and use his evil power to slaughter with ease, have made him a ferocious enemy. If you're familiar with Loki's evil charms or have seen ""Thor"" – to whom he is an adopted brother – then you are fully aware of his frightening desire to prove his capacity to rule. Loki's failure to reign in space further fuels his desire to be King – but on Earth. By demeaning the powers of humans and taking advantage of their inability to unite, his true motives and means are revealed, ""It's the unspoken truth of humanity that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power. For identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel."" Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson), director of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D, reactivates The Avengers Initiative which, in other words, consists of joining the power of superheroes. The first to be recruited are Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff (Scarlet Johansson) and Dr. Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) now with new and improved anger management skills! Mind you, all it takes is for the deliciously provocative Tony Stark/ Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) to let rip and, well we all know what happens when The Hulk gets mad! Thor's intervention is mainly due to his attachment to our mortal specie. Remember when he fell in love with one? The result at first is a chaos of people with weird outfits, the egos of superheroes and a tremendously dissimilar ensemble. It seems like each has been evacuated from their respective film sets after a fire alarm and ended up in the same room. It is hilarious as they ridicule each other's guise but mostly, they prove their inability to compromise and unite which is exactly what Loki was hedging his bets on.After a power display of muscles and skills – with a number of injuries along the way – Fury interferes within his capacity (not physical of course) to motivate them and direct their attention to the one antagonist instead of each other.I don't remember having enjoyed any of the individual films starring our aforementioned heroes therefore I was skeptical about this collective initiative. To my delight though, I spent those two cinematic hours laughing out loud to an unexpected, incredibly well-written script, combined with an aesthetically intoxicating action, sci-fi, adventure and the magic of comics. Watching the film in the cinema was a fantastic experience all round.An elite cast for the genre, the most pleasant surprise of them all is Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk (previously performed by Edward Norton) in a first with such a role, polished with craft. The epic dialogue is unforgettable, with key quotes that are sure to continue ringing out in the DFI offices and with Marvel/The Avengers lovers around the world.

2018-05-23,"I'd watched some of the films preceding this one and enjoyed most of them (Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, and even Hulk) and was curious about the next installment. Plus, Joss Whedon (of Firefly) was directing. This is easily my favorite of the Avengers films and it's one of the best superhero films on the Marvel side. The X-Men films were decent but they couldn't come close to this. I'd say the Avengers are my favorite superhero alliance when it comes to Marvel Comics.

Thor-the ignorant man.

2013-12-16,"Marvel's the Avengers is nothing short of an amazing movie. If there's anything I can say, it's that it is the best superhero movie I have seen. Not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last you a lifetime, it has an emotional core and you actually get to care about each and every single character despite the big cast. It's good that we get to see our favorite heroes Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and Hulk all join forces to defeat evil. Amazing indeed! Joss Whedon's film is about how our favorite heroes form an alliance called S.H.I.E.L.D and their mission is to stop Loki, Thor's half-brother from destroying New York City and the rest of the world.This film boasts an impressive cast indeed. Robert Downey Jr is here and witty as usual. Chris Evans as Capt. America is great and a good leader. Chris Hemsworth as Thor is very good. Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was an interesting casting choice but it works out. Tom Hiddleston as Thor is a slimy, sarcastic guy but he makes a great villain. On a side note, one of my favorite scenes involves a confrontation between Loki and Hulk.Overall, this is one amazing superhero movie! It's funny, action-packed, and emotional. The final 45 minutes is just great with all the action scenes. This movie is essentially Transformers but with a better story. This movie has me waiting for the sequel and subsequent spin-offs. A word to DC fans who hate this film just because it's from Marvel: It's a great film(just like the Batman films.)

2014-07-05,"There have been many superhero movies that I have massively enjoyed like Spider-Man and the much praised X-Men 2. While I do get that some people consider X-Men 2, or even Spider-Man 2 as the best examples of a superhero movie done right, one cannot ignore the sheer magnitude of The Avengers project. With the set-up beginning in 2008 with Iron Man and ending with Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), fans had been waiting anxiously for the result and I for one loved it. The plot revolves around the threat that Loki poses as he hopes to conquer earth with a feared army of advanced alien beings that will be transported to our planet through the energy source known as the Tesseract. In this dire situation, Nick Fury will look to assemble a group of remarkable people that will be known as The Avengers.The pacing of the film is wonderfully done as it takes about 30 minutes to introduce the characters in the movie. From then on, the perils outside but also within the group's personality will create the conflict the film needs. The choice of going with Joss Whedon as the director and co-writer was definitely a wise one, as he supplies us with his sharp vision of the story and characters, but also his dynamic and funny dialog. Everyone of the performances were great with everyone having their time in the spotlight, at least in my view. The effects are of course very well put within the film and only add to its spectacle.As far as I'm concerned, it may take a long time for me to get sick of this movie, and even then that's a remote possibility. With it's spot safely secured within my Top 20, its unlikely I'll ever watch a film like The Avengers. I just hope the sequel can deliver as much as this, and perhaps something even more unexpected.Rating 9,5/10",10.0,2014-07,Saturday,"10:0.05, about:0.04, alien:0.06, also:0.08, america:0.04, and:0.18, are:0.03, army:0.07, around:0.06, as:0.30, assemble:0.07, at:0.03, avenger:0.07, avengers:0.08, be:0.06, been:0.08, beginning:0.07, best:0.04, but:0.05, can:0.04, captain:0.04, characters:0.07, course:0.06, definitely:0.06, director:0.05, do:0.04, done:0.11, earth:0.06, effects:0.04, enjoyed:0.06, even:0.12, ever:0.05, everyone:0.11, fans:0.06, far:0.06, film:0.13, first:0.04, for:0.07, from:0.03, funny:0.05, fury:0.05, get:0.08, going:0.05, great:0.03, group:0.13, had:0.04, have:0.06, having:0.06, he:0.07, his:0.08, hope:0.07, in:0.11, iron:0.03, is:0.02, it:0.08, its:0.09, joss:0.04, just:0.03, least:0.06, like:0.06, ll:0.06, loki:0.04, long:0.06, look:0.06, loved:0.06, man:0.10, many:0.05, may:0.06, me:0.04, minutes:0.07, more:0.04, movie:0.07, movies:0.03, much:0.08, my:0.07, nick:0.05, of:0.20, on:0.03, one:0.08, only:0.04, or:0.04, our:0.07, people:0.10, performances:0.07, plot:0.05, put:0.06, rating:0.07, right:0.05, sequel:0.07, set:0.06, some:0.04, something:0.05, story:0.04, superhero:0.08, take:0.06, takes:0.07, tesseract:0.07, that:0.14, the:0.55, their:0.04, then:0.10, there:0.03, this:0.06, through:0.06, time:0.07, to:0.12, top:0.06, up:0.04, us:0.06, very:0.04, was:0.03, watch:0.04, well:0.04, were:0.04, whedon:0.04, while:0.06, will:0.15, with:0.20"
2024-09-04,"Ever dreamed of watching three buff dudes beat the crap out of each other while saving the planet? Well, Avengers serves it up on a titanium platter. Joss Whedon somehow managed to shove a billionaire in armor, a Norse god, and a scientist-turned-MMA-fighter-when-angry into the same room. And let's be honest, in real life, these guys would be shooting at each other before finishing their drinks. Nick Fury's gonna need some serious cleaning supplies after this one.Between Stark's mega-ego, Captain America's old-school, ""I-sound-like-your-grandpa"" vibe, and Thor, who spends more time combing his hair than swinging Mjolnir, you start wondering if this movie should've been titled Ego Wars. But that's Whedon's magic: making you believe these guys can work together, even though you half-expect them to grab a ball and just play a pickup game. Still, the movie makes you think these flawed heroes are exactly what Earth needs. Well, if you're into collapsed skyscrapers and city-sized craters.If we're talking Avengers, we've got to mention the villain. Enter Loki: a guy who's decided that manipulating humans is way more fun than sorting out his family drama. With his sneaky grins and baby-tyrant speeches, he's like that dude at a party trying to convince you the Earth is flat after a few mojitos. Hiddleston does his job well, making Loki both infuriating and fascinating. He brings a surprising complexity to a guy wearing horns bigger than his ego.But let's get real, you're here for the fights, right? The action in Avengers is heavy-so heavy it makes the Battle of Helm's Deep look like a neighborhood squabble. The highlight, of course, is Hulk, turning every fight scene into glorious, apocalyptic chaos. When you see him ragdoll Loki like a dirty sock, you realize even gods can't stand up to a raging green behemoth. If you're here for action, don't worry-you're getting more than your fill.Black Widow? She's basically the James Bond of the group, kicking ass in an evening gown without smudging her mascara. As for Hawkeye... well, we're still figuring out why he's here. But the guy's got arrows, and he does his best not to get overshadowed by the demigods around him. He's the dude who shows up to a Ferrari party with a Clio, acting like he's got nothing to prove.Avengers isn't a movie that's going to make you think too hard. It's action, fun, and pure spectacle. It's the kind of film where you scarf down popcorn, knowing you're about to watch spandex-wearing heroes save the planet while cheerfully beating each other senseless. Joss Whedon understands that explosions are great, but characters are even better. So if you're in the mood to watch Thor, Iron Man, and Hulk smash things for two hours, this movie's got your name all over it.",10.0,2024-09,Wednesday,"about:0.03, acting:0.04, action:0.07, after:0.07, all:0.02, america:0.03, an:0.03, and:0.15, are:0.07, around:0.05, as:0.02, at:0.05, avengers:0.08, battle:0.04, be:0.04, been:0.03, before:0.04, believe:0.05, best:0.03, better:0.03, between:0.04, black:0.03, both:0.05, brings:0.05, but:0.08, by:0.03, can:0.05, captain:0.03, characters:0.02, course:0.05, does:0.07, don:0.03, down:0.04, each:0.10, earth:0.08, even:0.09, ever:0.04, every:0.04, expect:0.05, few:0.04, fight:0.04, film:0.02, for:0.07, fun:0.07, fury:0.04, get:0.06, getting:0.05, god:0.05, going:0.04, got:0.18, great:0.03, group:0.05, guy:0.14, guys:0.10, half:0.05, hard:0.05, hawkeye:0.04, he:0.17, her:0.05, here:0.12, heroes:0.07, hiddleston:0.04, him:0.08, his:0.18, hours:0.05, hulk:0.05, if:0.14, in:0.08, into:0.10, iron:0.03, is:0.06, isn:0.05, it:0.08, job:0.04, joss:0.06, just:0.02, kind:0.05, let:0.10, life:0.05, like:0.12, loki:0.09, look:0.05, make:0.03, makes:0.08, making:0.09, man:0.03, more:0.08, movie:0.07, need:0.05, nick:0.04, not:0.02, nothing:0.04, of:0.09, old:0.05, on:0.02, one:0.02, other:0.09, out:0.08, over:0.04, play:0.05, re:0.36, real:0.09, right:0.04, same:0.04, save:0.05, scene:0.04, see:0.03, serious:0.06, she:0.05, should:0.04, so:0.05, some:0.03, stand:0.06, stark:0.04, start:0.05, still:0.07, than:0.12, that:0.09, the:0.26, their:0.03, them:0.03, these:0.10, things:0.05, think:0.07, this:0.05, thor:0.05, though:0.04, time:0.03, to:0.18, together:0.03, too:0.03, two:0.04, up:0.08, ve:0.08, villain:0.04, watch:0.06, watching:0.04, way:0.03, we:0.10, well:0.11, what:0.03, whedon:0.09, when:0.06, where:0.04, while:0.08, who:0.09, why:0.04, widow:0.03, with:0.04, without:0.04, work:0.04, would:0.03, you:0.33, your:0.12"
2024-12-08,"When the Asgardian god Loki seeks revenge against his brother Thor, his machinations unwittingly lead teenager Rick Jones to collect Ant-Man (Hank Pym), the Wasp and Iron Man to help Thor and the Hulk, the latter of whom Loki used as a pawn. After the group vanquished Loki, Ant-Man stated that the five worked well together and suggested they form a team; the Wasp named the group Avengers.The roster changed almost immediately; in the second issue (November 1963), Ant-Man became Giant-Man, and at the end of the issue, the Hulk left once he realized how much the others feared his unstable personality. Captain America joined the team in issue #4 (March 1964), and he was given ""founding member"" status in the Hulk's place. The Hulk, upset about being replaced by Captain America and the apparent betrayal by Rick, sought revenge against the Avengers, who teamed up with the Fantastic Four to stop him in The Fantastic Four #26 (May 1964).

2012-11-18,"Joss Whedon's ""Marvel's The Avengers"" is a wonderfully crafted and delightfully surprising detour from the prevalent ""Super Hero blockbuster"" film formula. There has been constant chatter about an Avengers film for years among super hero fans, even long before the film was announced. Ever since Spiderman opened the door for film adaptations of the sizeable Marvel super hero roster. If the Marvel universe was going to be put to the screen, an Avengers film was an obvious choice for a finale (of sorts, there will almost certainly be sequels to ""The Avengers""). Film buffs and comic book gurus alike expressed growing uncertainty at the prospect somewhere around the time of the disappointing Spiderman 3 and Thor films, though Captain America and the Iron Man movies were almost unanimously well received. The hesitation was mostly due to the way recent super hero movies have been produced. Too often we were forced to acknowledge awkward pacing, convoluted and ineffective plot lines, excessive reliance on special effects, flat dialogue, and questionable camera work, to name a few complaints from a very long list. When it was announced that Whedon would be at the helm, many were reassured and anticipation grew.It would seem Whedon was the perfect choice for this film. It's easy to see how poorly it could have been executed by a more pedestrian writer and director. The film plays to expectations and winks to fandom without being exhausting or pandering, while avoiding the clichés that drain the energy from other Marvel film outings. Whedon expertly avoids the ""grim"" trend yet does not venture into camp or goofiness, his tightrope act between genres and conventions is equally impressive as it is beneficial to the film. In a vague way he seems to capture the spirit of the comic book story arcs themselves, this is certainly not super heroes shoehorned into an action flick.The large cast of characters is executed about as perfectly as possible. There is a fantastic on screen chemistry, particularly throughout the childish feuds between Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor. The sharp contrasts in their personal beliefs about their powers and society are highlighted and displayed in a thought-provoking manner. Whedon's experience is evident, with the plot driving the characters rather than a mechanical rationing of camera time between each hero. A great example of this is how he utilizes the Incredible Hulk, a character that has been the bane of more than one director. Knowing we haven't seen the Hulk in action in a few years, and that we would be eager to see how he is managed in this new and more mature setting, Whedon doesn't reveal Bruce's maniacal alter-ego until roughly two-thirds into the film. And when he does, the pay off makes the buildup strategy a clearly superior choice. The villainous Loki is a fine nemesis in concept and is rendered successfully as dastardly and detestable. Whedon opted for a more light hearted and entertaining overall feel with none of the heavy handed forced philosophy, though there is a well-played theme of the need for cooperation. The theme carries over well and does justice to the concept of the Avengers: America's greatest minds and forces, with vastly different abilities and personalities, setting aside their differences and squabbles to save the world.",10.0,2012-11,Sunday,"about:0.08, action:0.04, almost:0.08, america:0.07, an:0.09, and:0.30, are:0.02, around:0.04, as:0.07, at:0.05, avengers:0.09, be:0.08, been:0.11, before:0.04, being:0.03, between:0.11, blockbuster:0.04, book:0.07, bruce:0.04, by:0.02, captain:0.05, cast:0.03, certainly:0.10, character:0.03, characters:0.04, comic:0.06, could:0.03, dialogue:0.04, different:0.04, director:0.07, does:0.10, doesn:0.04, each:0.03, effects:0.03, entertaining:0.04, even:0.03, ever:0.03, expectations:0.04, experience:0.05, fans:0.04, fantastic:0.04, feel:0.04, few:0.07, film:0.23, films:0.03, for:0.10, from:0.07, going:0.03, great:0.02, greatest:0.05, has:0.05, have:0.04, haven:0.05, he:0.10, hero:0.17, heroes:0.03, his:0.03, how:0.09, hulk:0.04, if:0.02, impressive:0.05, in:0.10, incredible:0.04, into:0.09, iron:0.05, is:0.17, it:0.07, joss:0.03, lines:0.04, loki:0.03, long:0.07, makes:0.03, man:0.04, many:0.03, marvel:0.09, more:0.10, movies:0.05, need:0.04, new:0.04, not:0.04, of:0.15, off:0.03, on:0.04, one:0.02, or:0.05, other:0.03, over:0.03, overall:0.04, perfect:0.04, perfectly:0.04, played:0.04, plot:0.06, powers:0.05, put:0.04, rather:0.05, save:0.05, screen:0.06, see:0.05, seem:0.05, seems:0.04, seen:0.03, since:0.04, special:0.03, story:0.03, super:0.17, than:0.05, that:0.06, the:0.52, their:0.08, there:0.09, this:0.06, thor:0.05, though:0.07, thought:0.04, throughout:0.05, time:0.05, to:0.19, too:0.03, two:0.04, universe:0.04, until:0.05, very:0.03, was:0.10, way:0.06, we:0.09, well:0.07, were:0.08, whedon:0.20, when:0.05, while:0.04, will:0.03, with:0.05, without:0.04, work:0.04, world:0.03, would:0.08, years:0.07, yet:0.04"

Jackson), to thwart the villainous Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Right from the opening scene, a belabored set piece boasting one of the most listless car chases ever filmed, the movie feels off.

2013-09-12,"I will not say that it's a good movie; it's a great movie. All the casts did a wonderful job to bring these heroic characters to life. It was not just the best superhero movie made. Starting with Robert Downey Jr.; who seemed to slip through scene to scene. He played almost fluently, providing his lines with virtually eases providing his charisma, personality and smugness to brighten up. The well 2 hrs+ movie, Avengers is well-paced and time quickly flew by. The effects were top-notch and the performance was quite good. The script is the main part that drives the whole movie in elevating manner. For those people who have not seen any other movie, we are bringing enough information to bring everybody to momentum. The movie provides more than normal comic book movie but the story with cause that was backed up with unbelievable humor and action.The Avengers was greatly entertaining. All the action scenes were great and satisfying.No one is short changed during the action or fighting scene. Not a single scene looked bad to me. A few dialogs seemed off but once you recall the character, it all makes perfect sense. Every respective characters is honest and true to itself. Everyone brought up their persona to the movie and definitely it is the best Marvel movie till now. Superheroes want super troubles to resolve to shine up. Each hero in this movie has to handle some sort of problem to its personal super power. Only by working as a team, they can conquer the evil threats. One of the best things in this great movie is the utilization of the leather jackets. Avengers got its success with the use of attractive leather jackets worn by different characters to uplift their personality. Desert leather is the manufacturer of quality Hollywood style jackets as worn in every blockbuster movie. This super hit and memorable movie easily satisfied the expectations needed.

Mostly funny punching. There is lots of punching. First it gets silly then stay silly then feel like blaming you for being silly too... with punching. Script make sense only if you hang on toilet wall. Not make sense in film. People say film awesome. Batman awesome, has story. Makers assume you smart enough to feed yourself. This one assume dumb enough to chew off own fingers if try to eat hotdog. Is OK. Just not good. Iron man was good. He good character, funny and engaged with reason why he punching. Captain American not bad but too silly. This one just too silly. Liked hulk a bit but was there hulk film? Don't think so. Hawkeye rubbish. Heros are legend, god, monster and funny armour man who drink a lot... and Hawkeye. He has a bow and arrow. He not scary. My kid has bow and arrow. Used to. He shot cat, made him eat it. Only way they learn. Why they call avengers? They not avenge anything. They should call something else. Maybe call them justice league. That has nice ring. And cute girl in tight clothes. Nice touch. Was OK and approve. So. Not bad film. Like watching poor version of iron man or good version of Captain American. bit disappoint. Recommend for people with nothing better to do.

2016-06-29,"This was a long anticipated movie that teams up multiple superheroes for the first time and confirms MCU completely. The last five MCU movies have all be leading up to this. And it's here now. So, is it good?I like it that they tried making a comic book cinematic universe and teaming up all those superheroes. In fact, I love that idea. And it got very good ratings and I liked the movie. It was fun, it was well done, the dialogues were well written and it was so cool to see all these heroes working together. And also, Alan Silvestri's score is very good and it's one of the best superhero movie themes I've ever heard. But the story, the similar problem I had before, just wasn't big or epic enough. It felt like a special longer TV episode with huge budget. The plot was just too simple for such an epic idea and most of the main plot happens in one day. It's not messy at all but that's because of the thin plot. And even when there are in danger there are still humorous parts, so when there are some emotional moments, they don't really fit in. There is a death of a side character somewhere in the middle and everyone is so sad about it, but I could barely remember his name, so it did nothing for me. But it's not about the actors. The acting is great and everyone shines in their roles, but I still liked Tom Hiddleston as Loki the most. Also there is a recast of one character, Hulk. He's played by Mark Ruffalo and I think he's also pretty good in his own way. Ruffalo is closer to the comics, but Norton's grounded approach was very good and it shows us how badly affected he is with his ""gift"". And one more flaw, enemies were to easily defeated in my opinion. Aside from Loki's plan and all the fights between them in the first half, The Avengers never really faced anything that was a really big threat and they got out of every danger too easily.Very fun, very well done movie and the first superhero team up movie and that's way it gets so much points from me, but I was just slightly disappointed because of the lack of challenge to the heroes and the weak plot.",8.0,2016-06,Wednesday,"about:0.06, acting:0.04, actors:0.05, all:0.11, also:0.10, an:0.03, and:0.33, anything:0.05, are:0.07, as:0.02, at:0.03, avengers:0.02, be:0.02, because:0.07, before:0.04, best:0.03, between:0.04, big:0.08, book:0.04, but:0.15, by:0.03, character:0.07, cinematic:0.06, comic:0.04, comics:0.05, cool:0.05, could:0.04, day:0.06, did:0.04, disappointed:0.06, don:0.04, done:0.09, enough:0.05, epic:0.11, even:0.03, ever:0.04, every:0.04, everyone:0.09, fact:0.05, felt:0.05, first:0.10, for:0.06, from:0.05, fun:0.08, gets:0.05, good:0.14, got:0.10, great:0.03, had:0.03, half:0.05, have:0.02, he:0.09, here:0.04, heroes:0.07, hiddleston:0.05, his:0.10, how:0.04, huge:0.05, hulk:0.03, idea:0.12, in:0.17, is:0.14, it:0.26, just:0.08, last:0.05, like:0.05, liked:0.11, loki:0.06, long:0.05, love:0.04, main:0.05, making:0.05, mark:0.04, mcu:0.12, me:0.06, moments:0.05, more:0.03, most:0.07, movie:0.10, movies:0.03, much:0.03, my:0.03, never:0.04, norton:0.06, not:0.05, nothing:0.05, now:0.04, of:0.13, one:0.09, opinion:0.06, or:0.03, out:0.03, own:0.05, parts:0.06, played:0.05, plot:0.16, pretty:0.05, really:0.09, ruffalo:0.08, see:0.03, simple:0.06, so:0.16, some:0.03, special:0.04, still:0.08, story:0.03, such:0.05, superhero:0.07, superheroes:0.08, team:0.04, that:0.12, the:0.35, their:0.03, them:0.03, there:0.14, these:0.04, they:0.08, think:0.04, this:0.04, those:0.04, time:0.03, to:0.08, together:0.03, tom:0.04, too:0.07, universe:0.05, up:0.12, us:0.05, ve:0.04, very:0.16, was:0.17, wasn:0.05, way:0.07, well:0.09, were:0.07, when:0.07, with:0.04, written:0.06"

2019-06-15,"This movie started off the big budget franchise we loved for 7 years by now. Ok, let me get into why I liked this film. Starting with Story,
The story is interesting as it kept my attention from beginning to end and it was so exciting for us to have our heroes come together to fight against Loki but The Avengers doesn't have much of a story as it doesn't have layers to its story and its very simplistic compared to the complexity of the other Avengers films. They told a cohesive and understandable storyline in this first Avengers film.
Second, let's get into the characters of this film.
The characters have really great banter between them as you have really good chemistry between each member of the Avengers. The main characters have backstory established in the previous MCU Solo Films that built up to the Avengers and the characters are elaborately written. Cap as an example is a brave Soldier as established in the First Avenger and his character see's in Tony a man who wouldn't sacrifice himself or any kind of character inside the suit. Tony see's a man who got all his powers from a bottle who isn't worthy but they both prove each other wrong in specific MCU films such as Tony who almost killed himself to stop the Chitauri Invasion on Earth. Tony is a great character who's trying to do good and has guilt over his mistakes that he's done but I wish they had gone more into this backstory. The only character I didn't like was Loki, the villain who you couldn't understand and you didn't know why he was invading Earth. He's just a big threat who wants to Invade Earth because he just wants to but all the heroes have arcs until they cooperate with each other.
Third, let's explore the themes of this movie. There's deep themes of Sacrifice, Teamwork and Heroism. The Avengers mostly are working as a team and from beginning to end, they learn to cooperate with each other so they can defeat Loki. All the heroes are saving the world from Loki. An example of Sacrifice is Tony who almost sacrifices himself to save Earth from the Chitauri invasion.
Fourth, let's explore the acting. The cast is amazing. Robert Downey Jr is the best actor here as you cannot imagine anyone else in this role and Chris Evans shows the bravery of his character here. Scarlet Johansson is attractive and she's a fun female character who's a interesting spy. Mark Ruffalo has more charming humor than the other Hulk Actors and he's always having fun in this role. For me, the cast was great as everyone did a good job on their performances and roles.
Next, let me analyze the visuals. The special effects here are stunning as they all look realistic and the visuals are overly authentic as there's never a look at really fake looking CGI or special effects. The movie did well in this category.

2014-02-05,"I do not read comics. I've tried, but they just seem like watered-down versions of the shows I watched as a kid, like Batman TAS or Teen Titans.But I love cinema. I've been keeping up with all the Marvel movies released prior to the Avengers and they were always teasing at an Avengers movie. And let me be the one millionth to say...""OH MY GOD, THIS IS THE GREATEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!""And what a movie it is. It has comedy, it has action, character interactions, drama, EVERYTHING a movie needs. Not just a comic book film, ANY film. But, when you get down to it, Avengers is a comic book that has been cleanly and perfectly translated to the big screen.But what sets Avengers apart from other movies is the mere fact that it WORKED. Every single character in this has been the leading man in their own movie (or has the potential to be) and yet the film focuses on them all. It's like if you got John Lennon, William Shatner, and George Peppard to be in a movie together with Vincent Price as the villain and the story managed to revolve around ALL of them.The plot is unoriginal, but that's not what carries the movie. What carries the movie is the characters. Even the scenes with Thor, Cap, Iron Man and Nick Fury just TALKING are fun and engaging, and no scene drags or is too fast.

2024-12-11,"The deaths. I sent out a tweet right after I got out of the theatre saying that my one-word review of this film is, 'ambitious' and that's because of the outcome of many of this film's main characters. At the end of the film, we see Thanos complete his mission of collecting all of the Infinity Stones, with the sacrifice of his own daughter and Guardian of the Galaxy, Gamora.In my favorite scene of the film, Thor sinks his new ax deep into Thanos' chest, and Thanos says through a wicked grin, ""You should have went for the head,"" and he snaps his fingers, just like in the original source material and destroys half of all life in the universe. Moments later some of our favorite heroes start reducing to dust and every single person in my theatre was stunned.There was a moment when fan favorite, Black Panther started reducing to dust and a person in the theatre audibly yelled out, cursing at the screen. This sequence which had no music behind it was extremely eerie and shocking in a beautifully vindictive way.A lot of our favorite heroes were just straight up dying and the movie ends on that cliffhanger. I called it ambitious because we don't know if any of these characters like Spiderman, Black Panther, Scarlet Witch and many others are ever gonna come back. I mean they will be revived because Spiderman and Black Panther made like 2 billion dollars and are both scheduled for second movies, but right now they are dead. Our heroes lost and that's never happened before.Even though this is called 'Avengers: Infinity War', this is Thanos' movie at its core. Marvel has been building Thanos for ten years and in this movie, he cemented himself as the greatest villain in the MCU, which has had villain problems in previous films.

2012-05-10,"I was really looking forward to the Avengers and, I have to say I was disappointed. Lousy acting (Samuel L.

Lousy photography...the 3D glasses made everything seem dark and drab, I found myself taking them off and seeing much brighter scenes. I'm sure if you're a 12 year old (sadly I'm not) this movie is the best thing you've ever seen, but there are so many other movies of this genre that are so much better on every level (X- Men, and the Batman series in the capable hands of Christopher Nolan to mention two). Captain America's padding in his shirts was laughable (did they run out of CG's, because he looked much better in his own movie). I'm comparing this movie to Avatar because I was also disappointed with that one too, as it relied totally on on special effects, weak story- line, to make it's success.

2022-04-29,"The Avengers is peak commercialism, fusing merchandising and fun. Despite its flaws, the script successfully paces characters and tension by restraining action early on. Meanwhile, Whedon's humor is measured, taking key threats seriously. Furthermore, as the first crossover superhero film, its gimmick was still novel. Yet, it's difficult to overly praise the writing because of its generic conflict, convenient devices, nonsense science, sanitized action, and predictability. Plus, the finale doesn't establish objectives, spacing, or tactics. Characters aimlessly run around, artificially serving emotional beats. Therefore, while The Avengers is an enjoyable blockbuster, its story is fallible.On a technical level, The Avengers is solid. First and foremost, its casting is king and paved the way for the franchise juggernaut. Next, the soundtrack has an iconic melody (yet is generally forgettable), the production design is a merchandising extravaganza (yet is otherwise unimaginative), and the sound is comprehensive with abstract touches. The editing isn't dynamic, but blends plotlines and keeps the pacing tight. The cinematography has energy and a symbolic upside-down shot. Lastly, the effects are significant (despite being obvious). Overall, The Avengers has a cohesive tone and moves with purpose. It's not art, but it's landmark entertainment.Writing: 6/10

2013-04-04,"Getting to Know The AvengersMarvel's Avengers brings together many big names in the comic book world. Six gifted protagonists – Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Dr. Bruce Banner aka Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), set out to battle one sole antagonist, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his alien army. The movie gives each character their shining moments, keeping it from focusing solely on a certain character. It is your typical action packed family movie that everyone can enjoy.For someone who hasn't seen every Marvel movie that has come out in the last couple years, the movie makes it a little difficult to recognize all of the characters like Black Widow and Hawkeye. However, without knowing all of the characters the plot remains easy to follow. Loki is the villain and S.H.E.I.L.D. isn't going down without a fight. S.H.E.I.L.D is briefly mentioned in some of the previous movies and is usually denied by the heroes. Each of heroes has to fight internal battles. They each have to get over working alone and try to work together. It's a very typical of the characters to not get along at first and then come together as a great team.For almost the whole movie, the heroes keep you laughing like a typical family movie. Keeping the humor even in some of the more action packed parts of the movie can keep many of the non-comic fans interested in the movie. However, one huge weakness that the movie Avengers had was the comment that Thor made about Loki being adopted. It sets a negative light on adopted children, labeling him a tyrant because of it. Another weakness I felt the movie has is that The Avengers were so easily manipulated by Loki. In their team they have two of the greatest minds of their generation working together, and they still didn't get that Loki was using them for his personal gain. How does one villain manage to overtake six, highly talented and well trained ""super heroes""?I hadn't seen Thor or The Hulk when I first watched The Avengers. I had no clue what I was really going to be stepping into when I purchased my movie ticket. I was worried I wouldn't know half the heroes and I definitely didn't know the villain. Thankfully the plot was easy to follow and light was shined enough on each of the characters to give me, at least, a light grasp on who the heroes were.This movie was really fun to watch for the first time. It was a little long but it kept my attention throughout the whole film. I feel like more of the heroes personalities could have been shown more, but in that case the movie would have been too long.

2018-04-29,"There's a sense of infancy and an accompanying intimacy, despite the large scale ending, because 'Avengers Assemble (2012)' is, for all intents and purposes, so retrospectively small and yet actually so big. It represents a keen, unprecedented challenge for writer/director Joss Whedon and it was a 'surprise' success to the delight of many a fan and studio-head across the globe. The fact it pulls off a six character crossover, without a clear protagonist I'll add, is impressive, and slightly concerning. It's also consistently entertaining and fast-paced, packing in all the action and spectacle you'd expect along with the quick character moments that make it stand out. There's the occasionally hammy line or ever so slightly cheesy moment, actually evocative of Whedon's style, that's only more amplified by the distance afforded by time and the fact that this flick wasn't what the MCU now is nor was it what the MCU then was, as it represented a shift in the 'universe' that was then shifted again rather quickly. These inconsistencies, of tone and character both past and prophetic future, aren't major issues and are often marked by moments of clairvoyant clarity or otherwise pitch perfection pertaining to comic-book character personas and, as such, the relatively plotless piece is still a delight to behold. It's smashy-bashy finale is also especially well-realised, though showing its age now, and feels like a tangible sequence rather than a series of green-screen sets connected by digital extensions. It isn't the best Marvel film, but it represented a big leap for the studio, and the genre as a whole, and is an enjoyable ride throughout. 8/10",8.0,2018-04,Sunday,"10:0.06, 2012:0.08, action:0.04, actually:0.14, again:0.06, all:0.06, along:0.08, also:0.10, an:0.08, and:0.38, are:0.04, as:0.10, assemble:0.08, avengers:0.03, because:0.05, best:0.05, big:0.12, book:0.06, both:0.08, but:0.03, by:0.18, character:0.19, comic:0.05, director:0.07, entertaining:0.07, especially:0.07, ever:0.06, expect:0.08, fact:0.16, fan:0.06, feels:0.08, film:0.04, for:0.09, genre:0.09, impressive:0.09, in:0.05, is:0.16, isn:0.08, it:0.26, its:0.05, joss:0.05, like:0.04, line:0.08, ll:0.08, make:0.05, many:0.06, marvel:0.04, mcu:0.17, moment:0.08, moments:0.14, more:0.04, now:0.12, of:0.15, off:0.06, only:0.05, or:0.09, out:0.04, past:0.09, rather:0.18, screen:0.06, sense:0.08, series:0.08, so:0.12, stand:0.09, still:0.06, such:0.07, than:0.05, that:0.12, the:0.37, then:0.12, there:0.08, these:0.06, this:0.03, though:0.07, throughout:0.09, time:0.04, to:0.07, universe:0.08, was:0.13, wasn:0.08, well:0.04, what:0.09, whedon:0.10, whole:0.07, with:0.03, without:0.07, yet:0.08, you:0.04"
2012-08-25,"So here it arrives, at last, after five films, four years, and many an explosion, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) are brought together (with the addition of Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner)) to become the third highest-grossing movie of all time (so far). While the individual films vary in quality, it is Joss Whedon who was chosen to handle such an big-name ensemble. The Avengers is hardly a masterpiece, but is one of the most effortlessly entertaining films I've ever seen, with a witty script, an extremely talented cast, and Scarlett Johansson's arse back in spandex.Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor's Asgardi brother, arrives on Earth via a portal created by the Tesseract cube, and destroys the headquarters of S.H.I.E.L.D., an espionage agency ran by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Fury calls on Steve Rogers (Evans) to help against Loki, who is busy causing a distraction as a Loki-possessed Hawkeye steals iridium needed to stabilise the Tesseract's power, and Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) calls on Tony Stark's (Downey Jr.) expertise in understanding the power that Loki may now wield. Natasha Romanoff (Johansson) is sent to Calcutta to round-up Bruce Banner, while Thor moves in after Rogers and Stark capture Loki. Soon enough, the group are bickering on board S.H.I.E.L.D.'s giant Helicarrier, while's Loki's grand plan comes to fruition.Joss Whedon clearly loves his comic-books. While the film in absolutely no way isolate's newcomers, this is a film for the geeks. Ever wanted to see the Incredible Hulk fight Iron Man? Or the Hulk punching Thor thity feet through the air? Iron Man mocking Thor with Shakespearian venom? What about the Hulk repeatedly smashing Loki against the floor (in possibly the most inspired moment of the film) by his legs? Well, nerds, you better start thinking about your gran before you spray your pants as The Avengers has them all and then some. It's a true indication of how the balance of power in Hollywood has shifted of late, with Internet chat-rooms providing a medium for many an uber-nerd to vent their opinions and approvals/disapprovals. With directors like Peter Jackson, Edgar Wright and Zack Snyder (as well as Whedon) amongst the directorial A-list, films no longer need to be bogged down with added romance or morality lessons to please the 'wider audience' producers thought existed, but instead go back to the source of what made the subject so beloved in the first place.But the film is far more than great special-effects and action scenes (though they are here in abundance), and shows that a film doesn't have to simply ejaculate in your face a la Michael Bay to make mega-bucks. Whedon's screenplay is the key to the film and the scenes in which the group verbally interact (especially in the early scenes where they despise each other) provides plenty of wit and genuine heart. No character is forgotten either - Whedon has experience handling an ensemble with the tragically cancelled Firefly series, which led to the terrific film adaptation Serenity (2005) - and The Avengers' 140+ running time allows them all to breathe, without anyone being lost amongst the enormous personalities and emotional complexities.Although it's not the best superhero film ever made, it's certainly the most fun. And with the darkness and psychological menace of The Dark Knight Rises still lingering in my mind, The Avengers offers a funnier, more care-free alternative in the genre (although The Avengers does have its share of genuine shocks). If there were any concerns about the film living up to its hype, they have been well and truly laid to rest, with Ruffalo's Bruce Banner providing yet another casting masterstroke after negotiations between Marvel and Edward Norton broke down (they can stop changing him now after three Hulk's in as many movies). Even though it does move a bit too frantically for its own good sometimes, Downey Jr. and co are just too magnetic for this to become a problem. The film offers yet another post-credits nipple-erecter, opening Marvel's universe even more, so hopefully there will be more of the same to come with The Avengers 2 (due 2015 according to IMDb) and Edgar Wright's Ant- Man (probably out next year).",8.0,2012-08,Saturday,"about:0.07, absolutely:0.04, action:0.02, after:0.11, against:0.07, agent:0.04, all:0.04, although:0.07, america:0.02, an:0.11, and:0.23, another:0.06, any:0.03, anyone:0.04, are:0.07, as:0.08, at:0.02, audience:0.04, avengers:0.09, back:0.06, banner:0.06, be:0.03, become:0.08, been:0.02, before:0.03, being:0.03, best:0.02, better:0.03, between:0.03, big:0.03, bit:0.03, black:0.02, brother:0.03, brought:0.04, bruce:0.06, but:0.04, by:0.06, can:0.02, captain:0.02, care:0.04, cast:0.03, certainly:0.04, character:0.02, chris:0.06, come:0.03, comes:0.03, comic:0.02, credits:0.04, dark:0.03, does:0.05, doesn:0.03, down:0.07, downey:0.07, each:0.02, earth:0.03, effects:0.02, enough:0.03, ensemble:0.08, entertaining:0.03, especially:0.03, evans:0.06, even:0.05, ever:0.08, experience:0.04, face:0.04, far:0.06, fight:0.03, film:0.18, films:0.10, first:0.02, for:0.06, four:0.04, fun:0.03, fury:0.06, genre:0.04, go:0.03, good:0.02, great:0.02, group:0.08, has:0.06, have:0.05, hawkeye:0.05, help:0.04, hemsworth:0.03, here:0.06, hiddleston:0.03, him:0.03, his:0.04, hollywood:0.04, how:0.02, hulk:0.09, hype:0.04, if:0.02, imdb:0.04, in:0.19, incredible:0.03, individual:0.04, instead:0.04, iron:0.06, is:0.11, it:0.07, its:0.07, jackson:0.06, jeremy:0.03, johansson:0.09, joss:0.05, jr:0.08, just:0.02, knight:0.04, last:0.03, like:0.02, loki:0.15, made:0.05, make:0.02, man:0.07, many:0.08, mark:0.03, marvel:0.04, may:0.03, mind:0.04, moment:0.04, more:0.08, most:0.07, movie:0.01, movies:0.02, my:0.02, need:0.04, next:0.04, nick:0.03, no:0.07, norton:0.04, not:0.02, now:0.06, of:0.15, on:0.07, one:0.02, or:0.04, other:0.02, out:0.02, own:0.03, place:0.04, power:0.12, probably:0.03, renner:0.03, rest:0.04, robert:0.02, ruffalo:0.05, same:0.03, samuel:0.03, scarlett:0.06, scenes:0.07, script:0.03, see:0.02, seen:0.03, series:0.04, simply:0.04, so:0.07, some:0.02, special:0.03, stark:0.06, start:0.04, still:0.03, stop:0.04, such:0.03, superhero:0.02, tesseract:0.08, than:0.02, that:0.03, the:0.51, their:0.02, them:0.04, then:0.03, there:0.04, they:0.07, this:0.02, thor:0.10, though:0.06, thought:0.03, through:0.03, time:0.04, to:0.25, together:0.02, tom:0.03, tony:0.03, too:0.05, true:0.04, truly:0.04, universe:0.04, up:0.04, ve:0.03, was:0.01, way:0.03, well:0.06, were:0.02, what:0.04, whedon:0.12, where:0.03, which:0.05, while:0.12, who:0.04, widow:0.03, will:0.02, with:0.14, without:0.03, witty:0.04, year:0.03, years:0.03, yet:0.07, you:0.03, your:0.09"
2019-11-15,"Bringing in Joss Whedon to direct and write Avengers Assemble fitted perfect, considering his history of tackling many characters within hundred and twenty or so minutes. After all he was director/writer of Buffy the vampire slayer. Never before has their been a superhero team up to this magnitude on the big screen. With a good sense of humour and someone who doesn't take superhero mesh ups too seriously, Whedon gets the tone spot on!Loki played by Tom Hiddleton is entertaining once more. Vastly entertaining and cunning he is more than a match for our team of heroes. This film introduces the characters and builds them up into team work few the vehicle of Nick Furys shield. Each actor feels made for the part, big Sam is the epitome of Nick Fury. Robert Downey Jr reprises his role as Tony Stark like only he can and Scarlett Johanson is back as Black Widow after her outing in Iron Man 2. Each character is in their own world when founded to join shield. Captain American aka Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is trying to adapt to the modern world. Hulk Bruce Banner played by (Mark Ruffalo) now taking over from Edward Norton, is still trying to remain safe without incidents. Iron Man, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is feeling uninitiated and unwanted from the shield and Thor played by (Chris Hemworth) is on earth to retrieve his brother. Loki retrieves the tesseract a power source energy and encounters the other, an extraterrestrial, whom in exchange will give him an army.This isn't the most indepth story but is lighthearted and never dull. Each character has different strengths which make them likeable and fully engaging to watch.

2023-12-20,"I still remember when the movie was released, because I was so excited that I watched the CAM version on the internet. With the experience of someone who has never seen Marvel comics, I don't know too much about the stories of each superhero, but everything is still enough to bring attraction throughout. The dialogue of the movie is truly the brightest gem, every line is interesting and reasonable, combined with a plot with depth and development of important characters, this movie will always retain its appeal no matter what, even more than 10 years have passed.

That's all that matters really. If you think it's a - fair enough - just don't attack others.So why is it a 10 for me? Because I have waited for the comic genre to finally be made to the highest level using the technology which allows the universe created on paper to become reality. The depth of story or character doesn't matter - it's a romp and an adventure, and just as my Dad enjoyed Saturday morning episode cinema because it was escapism...so is this.The 10 comes from the way it makes me feel - like a kid again, without the issues that impact life and make you stressed.

2024-09-02,"""The Avengers"" marks a significant milestone in the superhero genre, as it successfully brings together multiple heroes from separate films into one cohesive and entertaining ensemble. Directed by Joss Whedon, the film balances the personalities and backstories of characters like Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and the Hulk with remarkable skill. The dialogue is sharp, with plenty of wit and banter that highlight the differences-and eventual camaraderie-among the team. The action sequences are meticulously crafted, from the initial skirmishes between the heroes themselves to the climactic Battle of New York, which remains one of the most iconic set-pieces in the MCU. The visual effects are stunning, particularly the Hulk's transformation and the alien invasion. Moreover, Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston) is a charismatic and compelling antagonist whose motivations are well-developed, making him a standout villain in the MCU. What truly elevates ""The Avengers"" is its heart. Despite the grand scale of the movie, it never loses sight of the characters' humanity, which makes their journey from reluctant allies to a united team both believable and emotionally resonant. The film is a masterclass in how to handle an ensemble cast, balancing humor, action, and emotion in a way that feels satisfying and complete.",9.0,2024-09,Monday,"action:0.08, alien:0.09, america:0.05, an:0.05, and:0.27, are:0.12, as:0.04, avengers:0.08, battle:0.08, between:0.07, both:0.09, brings:0.10, by:0.10, captain:0.05, cast:0.07, characters:0.09, dialogue:0.09, effects:0.06, ensemble:0.20, entertaining:0.08, feels:0.10, film:0.09, films:0.06, from:0.14, genre:0.10, heroes:0.12, hiddleston:0.08, him:0.07, how:0.06, hulk:0.09, humor:0.08, in:0.16, into:0.06, iron:0.05, is:0.12, it:0.06, its:0.06, joss:0.06, like:0.05, loki:0.05, makes:0.07, making:0.08, man:0.05, mcu:0.20, most:0.06, movie:0.03, never:0.07, new:0.07, of:0.17, one:0.08, played:0.09, sequences:0.09, set:0.09, superhero:0.06, team:0.13, that:0.07, the:0.61, their:0.05, thor:0.05, to:0.09, together:0.06, tom:0.07, truly:0.10, villain:0.07, visual:0.09, way:0.06, well:0.05, what:0.05, whedon:0.06, which:0.12, with:0.07, york:0.10"

An alien invasion compels all superheroes to coalesce and tend to the extraterrestrial threat.Marvel's ambitious venture works wonders and reaches a gratifying conclusion. Fan favorite director Joss Whedon is able to merge several story lines into a seamless unitary one. He injects humor to proceedings and creates a spectacle tantamount to a comic book in motion. Also, he embraces the roots of all characters at his disposal, such as their text book costumes.Vibrant, fun and overwhelmingly entertaining, Avengers fulfills all prerequisites of a quintessential summer blockbuster. The alien assault is the crux of a sensational climactic battle, which features various 'money shots' and retains immense repeat value.An epic and novel experience, Avengers is the envy of major studios now scurrying to emulate Marvel's flawless triumph.

2021-04-28,"The Avengers was the first movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that I learnt about. Everyone was going crazy. Meanwhile I, who didn't know the basics of comic book superheroes, was wondering why are Superman, Batman and Spider-Man not on the cover of this movie. Just a few years ago I watched all the movies from the franchise when Infinity War came out just to know what the fuss was all about. And now that I see it, I understand why it was such a huge deal.After the events of Thor, Loki comes on earth to steal the Tesseract from SHIELD, and he does manage to do that. Meanwhile all the superheroes are getting their own relations straight so that they can team up and fight the bad guy. All the characters are shown to be in the places where they had been at the end of their respective movies. Although what they are doing is not very interesting, it is somewhat a realistic deptiction of what kinds of characters they are. And then they all come together, beat Loki and save the day. A pretty straightforward story moved by character development.There are a number of things I like about this movie. The scene where their airship's propeller stops working so Iron Man spins it so fast that it stabilises. It showed how strong and fast Iron Man is. There was also the scene where Iron Man goes through the portal and throws the missile away. It completely contradicts what Captain America considered him to be, showing how his character developed over the duration of the movie. I also like how Tony goes to have a word with Loki and tells him that the Avengers have a Hulk against his entire army. I mean I could literally go on about what a badass Iron Man was throughout the movie.Then there were Thor and Hulk. I really liked Thor ever since I first heard of him. He literally looks like a Norse god capable of highly destructive powers. Hulk, on the other hand, I didn't like him very much when I heard about him. Even in The Incredible Hulk he wasn't really entertaining. But here he actually feels like a very strong guy who has been trapped in the body of Bruce Banner. He gets angry every time someone calls him Bruce instead of Hulk, which shows how much he is struggling for his identity. Thor is just as awesome as I thought him to be. I always have a soft spot for superheroes who wear a cape.The visual effects were done really nicely. Though the impact of their powers wasn't very hard, but it's a campy movie. What can we possibly expect? It's from an era where every fight scene needed to have a comic relief who would tell jokes in the middle of the fight, be it Gimli from Lord of the Rings, Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars or Hound from Transformers. But the destruction was surely visible. Most of the shots are done from the point of view of a bystander. That is something I really like; it's literally the reason why I like Monsterverse. It is seen especially in the scene where Hulk rides the giant snake robot.Though there are a lot of things that I didn't like about this movie. First of all, the campiness. Obviously in today's time it's quite an easy thing to dismiss saying that back in 2012 movies were meant to be campy as the superhero genre hadn't been utilised properly, but the very same year The Dark Knight Rises came and the next year Man of Steel came. Both of them had the mature touch to it. Even the MCU movies before and after this one like Thor and Captain America: The Winter Soldier looked more mature than this baby thing. The other criticism I have towards this is Black Widow and Hawkeye. I hate botht he characters, and even more I hate how they are easily beating bad guys who are clearly stronger than them.The jump cuts of this movie are also very annoying. Every fight scene, especially the ones which have Black Widow in them, have like, a dozen scene cuts just to show that Natasha did a cartwheel, got on the bad guy's shoulders and snapped his neck. The same goes for Captain America and Hawkeye also. Not even once has Hawkeye shot anything in one take. It's something that can be easily shown even with a stunt double.Obviously this doesn't look special anymore, since I watched it after Infinity War had released, so there wasn't much of a surprise other than the fact that it's a team up movie. It has a good place in my memory so I wouldn't want to rewatch it and tamper its reputation. It's good in its place, it's a product of its time. It should stay that way. It's a one time watch in case you haven't seen it.",8.0,2021-04,Wednesday,"2012:0.03, about:0.11, actually:0.03, after:0.07, against:0.03, all:0.07, also:0.08, although:0.03, always:0.03, america:0.05, an:0.03, and:0.16, anything:0.03, are:0.15, army:0.03, as:0.04, at:0.02, avengers:0.03, away:0.03, awesome:0.03, back:0.03, bad:0.07, banner:0.02, batman:0.03, be:0.08, been:0.06, before:0.02, black:0.04, book:0.02, both:0.03, bruce:0.05, but:0.05, by:0.02, came:0.09, can:0.05, captain:0.05, character:0.04, characters:0.05, cinematic:0.03, come:0.02, comes:0.03, comic:0.04, could:0.02, dark:0.03, day:0.03, development:0.03, did:0.02, didn:0.07, do:0.02, does:0.02, doesn:0.03, done:0.05, earth:0.03, effects:0.02, end:0.02, entertaining:0.03, entire:0.03, especially:0.05, even:0.09, ever:0.02, every:0.07, everyone:0.02, expect:0.03, fact:0.03, feels:0.03, few:0.03, fight:0.10, first:0.06, for:0.03, franchise:0.03, from:0.11, genre:0.03, gets:0.03, getting:0.03, go:0.02, god:0.03, goes:0.10, going:0.02, good:0.03, got:0.03, guy:0.09, guys:0.03, had:0.06, hard:0.03, has:0.05, have:0.09, haven:0.03, hawkeye:0.07, he:0.12, here:0.02, highly:0.03, him:0.17, his:0.07, how:0.10, huge:0.03, hulk:0.09, in:0.13, incredible:0.03, instead:0.03, interesting:0.03, iron:0.06, is:0.08, it:0.23, its:0.06, just:0.06, knight:0.03, know:0.05, like:0.15, liked:0.03, loki:0.05, look:0.03, looks:0.03, lot:0.02, man:0.09, marvel:0.02, mcu:0.03, more:0.03, most:0.02, movie:0.10, movies:0.06, much:0.06, my:0.02, next:0.03, not:0.04, now:0.02, of:0.23, on:0.07, once:0.03, one:0.04, or:0.02, other:0.05, out:0.02, over:0.02, own:0.03, place:0.07, point:0.03, powers:0.07, pretty:0.03, quite:0.03, really:0.07, reason:0.03, same:0.05, save:0.03, scene:0.15, see:0.02, seen:0.04, should:0.02, show:0.03, since:0.05, so:0.07, something:0.05, special:0.02, star:0.03, story:0.02, such:0.03, superhero:0.02, superheroes:0.07, take:0.03, team:0.04, tesseract:0.03, than:0.06, that:0.14, the:0.46, their:0.07, them:0.05, then:0.05, there:0.08, they:0.09, thing:0.05, things:0.06, this:0.08, thor:0.08, though:0.05, thought:0.03, through:0.03, throughout:0.03, time:0.06, to:0.12, together:0.02, tony:0.03, transformers:0.03, understand:0.03, universe:0.03, up:0.03, very:0.11, visual:0.03, want:0.03, was:0.10, wasn:0.09, watch:0.02, watched:0.06, way:0.02, we:0.02, were:0.05, what:0.10, when:0.04, where:0.12, which:0.04, who:0.09, why:0.08, widow:0.04, with:0.02, would:0.02, year:0.06, years:0.03, you:0.01"

2014-06-02,"Marvel's The Avengers is a fantastic movie! Director Josh Wheldon did a fantastic job creating this movie. I highly recommend it to watch, but beware to those with young children...this movie should hold true to the PG-13 rating it was given. There is some language and intense battle scenes. But the overall message is great you have to come together to conquer evil. This movie gets that message across in a unique way of pulling together the world's best superheroes: Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Hulk. All the characters have been previously developed through other Marvel movies, which will help your understanding of this movie a lot more if you watch them in advance. Also, it never fails to amaze me how Marvel always manages to work in the cameo appearance of their founder and comic book writer, Stan Lee. I look for him in ever Marvel movie now. The overall basis of the movie is that Loki, Thor's not so nice little brother, is trying to take by the Tesseract, a blue cube that is an energy source and can connect multiple worlds. SHIELD, led by Nick Fury, pulls together the best superheroes to protect all people from Loki. Through a complicated, but well scripted and funny plot, the movie ends in a huge battle. Which you'll have to watch the movie to see how that goes... It really is a great movie with a well planned out cast and an amazing script. One of my favorite quotes is ""There is only one God, ma'am, and I'm pretty sure He doesn't dress like that"", said by Captain America. SO surprising that modern Hollywood will still say something towards Christianity; it was refreshing. Overall an amazing way to kill a couple of hours!

2019-07-07,"This film in essence is a fan boy film and hits all the spots you could've asked for as a marvel fan. Most the negative reviews I've seen of this film pull on aspects like too CGI dependent and compare it to films like dark knight or watchmen. Although films like watchmen and dark knight are superhero flicks like Avengers it's a very different ball park. Avengers is a fun ride with enjoyable characters, a great villain, good action, and it manages to do what no film of its time was able to. Successfully pull multiple main characters into a shared story which doesn't feel like overkill. The CGI element wasn't that big of a problem for me either. I do love practical effects and they trump CGI for me most of the time but when you've got such a heavy sci-fi story like this one you can't dream of using practical. It would be way too expensive and would take something away from the film for me.

The movie is very slow in the beginning and introduction of heroes didn't give much effect.Unwanted,extended action sequences and lots of unwanted dialogues made the movie dragging. If the was movie a little shorter with less conversations it could have been a better movie.Anyway the end/Climax action was good but still if hulk was not there this movie could have been a failure , I would say.being a huge fan Nolan's Batman might have made me to hate this movie.

The group must work together to protect the Earth from the leader of an extraterrestrial race and its army, who are intent on harnessing the cube's power.You got Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, the Hulk, the Black widow, Hawkeye joining forces, eh not easily as some of their alliance is shaky such as Iron Man and Captain America who take wordy pots shots at each other, which makes for good drama, and Loki is the reason Nick Fury of SHIELD brings them together. Starting off at a bang-up action sequence, this film never lets up in keeping you gripped. It's fast-paced, lively, dramatic when needed, but most of all what I liked about Avengers Assemble was the fact there was humour, an unbridled fun factor and some killer one liners. Also there are memorable scenes such as when Tony Stark is in his apartment and Loki confronts him. With a sleight of hand Stark casually puts his wrist watch on - the next minute Loki throws him out of the window. That's one killer tense moment. But being Stark, he has a trick up his sleeve.Overall, this is a firecracker of an actioner with a killer finale, great energetic action sequence, and a film that isn't afraid to just loosen up and not be so serious.",10.0,2022-04,Saturday,"about:0.05, action:0.08, all:0.03, also:0.06, america:0.15, an:0.22, and:0.21, are:0.08, army:0.09, as:0.11, assemble:0.09, at:0.09, avengers:0.04, be:0.04, being:0.07, black:0.12, brings:0.09, brother:0.08, but:0.07, captain:0.15, director:0.07, each:0.06, earth:0.07, evil:0.09, fact:0.09, film:0.08, for:0.03, from:0.09, fun:0.07, fury:0.07, god:0.08, good:0.04, got:0.08, great:0.05, group:0.09, has:0.05, hawkeye:0.06, he:0.05, him:0.14, his:0.15, hulk:0.08, humour:0.10, in:0.06, iron:0.14, is:0.11, isn:0.08, it:0.03, its:0.06, just:0.04, liked:0.09, loki:0.15, makes:0.07, man:0.13, moment:0.09, most:0.06, must:0.07, never:0.07, next:0.09, nick:0.07, not:0.07, of:0.24, off:0.07, on:0.08, one:0.08, other:0.05, out:0.05, overall:0.08, power:0.09, reason:0.09, scenes:0.06, serious:0.10, so:0.04, some:0.10, stark:0.21, such:0.15, superheroes:0.06, take:0.07, team:0.06, that:0.06, the:0.33, their:0.05, them:0.05, there:0.09, this:0.06, thor:0.09, to:0.05, together:0.11, tony:0.07, up:0.19, was:0.07, watch:0.05, what:0.05, when:0.16, which:0.06, who:0.10, widow:0.12, with:0.07, work:0.07, you:0.08"
2013-04-15,"This film was expected since 2008 with the movie Hulk (movie more or less), since Marvel has promised the film ""THE AVENGERS"", the famous group of super heroes (basically, the Justice League Marvel).

Iron man teaming up with Captain America? Thor measures strength with hulk? So many childhood dreams are flowing in the air. And I want them fulfilled now!The start gives a cold push to the plot in attempt to set up the main line but then also without any rush users us individually through every hero to finally make that eruption of boiling joy upon seeing Marvel iconic creations together. The pace after that runs down like a mountain river and your brain engorges the evens demanding more and more.Those who expect some twists or mind-bending storylines would be disappointed cause this is obviously an attraction to boost the popularity of this particular comic world to the global recognition. Instead of exercising your brain just relax and try not to jump from all adrenaline that fills you constantly during the whole sequence.Every character either old or seen for the first time builds up a pretty solid reputation and furthermore tries to look better among others that predictably gives us a peculiar showcase of abilities that increase a desire to meet with them closer in their spin-offs.Finally through masterful visuals covered by supreme score by Alan Silvestri we get what was expected and even more: a big bold statement of Marvel that shows the ability to bring comic books into life in a jaw-dropping manner; and along with Samuel L.

2014-05-13,"Very few times are my high expectations over-come by even GREATER PAYOFFS but Avengers definitely did that for me. I, for one, think that it had a lot of action scenes (and a few of them took a really long time) but then again it was a really long movie, so it also had plenty of time to develop plot and characters. Thankfully it allowed the movies to do a lot of the backgrounds for the characters, otherwise we would have been in for an extremely long ride.The Hulk was the standout character for me. Out of all of the superheroes in this movie he was by far my favorite (and has been my favorite for a very long time). Joss Whedon seriously knew how to make this movie into a Fanatic's wet dream and he held plenty of tension and plenty of drama in all the right places along with the kick ass action sequences. Though I would have liked Ed Norton to be the Hulk in this movie, the actor they picked for a stand-in was right on the money for a GREAT Bruce Banner. He was mild-mannered, smart, and cool-headed (well, you know what I mean). And the greatest parts were his action sequences, BY FAR!

It is a wide phenomenon and now, 12 years after going out with first ""Avengers"" movie, we are witnessing to another attempt to create this world, once again - it two years.The story is known for everyone, except my children. I have to state that now its magic is so much less attractive, then it was 12 years ago, but it still works each and every time. Still cool, still nails it and still looks amazing with all of the classical superheroes (and those that shoot with bow and arrow).Now a lot of dots are connecting, because I am older, smarter (not sure) and remembers several details from future MCU's movies.

2014-10-10,"This movie just did not do it for me. The movie was a box office hit: it made $623,279,547 in the United States alone, and is third on the list of top grossing films of all time. However, a movie's earnings do not suggest it was a great film. Obviously the concept was a hit: comic book superheroes converging to save earth and fight interstellar enemies. I just think the movie was flat, though. I myself am not a comic book enthusiast, so I do not personally care for superheroes and the sort, but the movie itself just seemed so bland. The characters actions seemed forced and there was just too much action for the movie to have any sort of depth. Of course, there had to be action, since they are superheroes, but I just felt like so much more could have been done with the film. I did not think the actors did very well, either. I think it was just the film, though: most of them are great actors. Crossovers and ensemble character films usually do not do well, and this film is a prime example. It was bland, predictable, and lacking in many fields, such as character depth and plot. Maybe it is just my own aversion to comic book films, specifically Marvel ones (I did not even like Guardians... shoot me now!), but I think many would agree with me in saying this summer blockbuster was severely underwhelming.

2024-05-05,"I was feeling nostalgic for the original Avengers movie, and it just so happens to have come out almost exactly 12 years ago to the day. This first team-up is so quaint compared to what came next, even though it's still pretty massive, and I remember how big it felt at the time. They made an ensemble superhero movie work better than ever before, with I guess X-Men walking so The Avengers could run.It doesn't hold up perfectly, and to some extent, I can understand a few of the reasons why it's become unfashionable to like this movie. It's big, broad, silly, and - unfortunately for some - snarky. The times have changed, and there was a style of filmmaking defined within this that many reject now, or have grown tired of. And I do get that, but I also appreciate what this was for the time.It was a significant movie and it defined blockbuster filmmaking for the rest of the decade it was released in. The MCU was unstoppable from about 2012 to 2019, and then even in the early 2020s, the franchise has had some serious hits. I don't think anything will ever stop the world again quite like The Avengers did, though. And it might not be the best MCU movie, but it's probably the most significant and game-changing.

2012-05-21,"Well if there were any short-comings offered by this movie, the superb cast and their excellent performances hid them. Additionally, I am certain there were massive egos to contend with, but the director (Joss Whedon) did a superb job keeping that aspect in tow. I can't say this movie was well worth the astronomical cost per person, nor the wasted time watching TV commercials – but it had more value-for-the-buck than some of the other tripe I sat through in the past.The storyline was fast paced; the CGIs did not outperform the actors/actresses, and the pontifications were eclipsed by things blowing up and all those awful bad guys getting their butts kicked. I gladly spent the big bucks to see it in the theater and will purchase a DVD copy (that way I can watch it a few more times without breaking the bank). This was an excellent swan-song for, 'The Avengers'. On that notewould I suggest a sequel? No way! Why spoil a good thing?

2013-07-29,"Its rare that a movie is able to not only live up to it's hype but actually exceed it.Avengers matches the hype surrounded by it and then blows it away. This huge scale superhero movie set the bar astronomically high for all other action movies, none of which have come close to attaining that height since.The Avengers pulled together arguably the greatest cast ever to share the screen. Not only was this an incredible feat based on the actors and actresses, but the characters themselves. Many worried how the movie would stay balanced and give each character their dues but director Joss Whedon proved it was possible.I wont get into the plot much as it's been explained numerous times, and honestly you should watch regardless of what the plot is. But with that said, the movie centers around a group of superheros brought together to stop an evil force, Loki, and his evil plans. The movie explores the dynamics of all the characters working as a team and how they pull together to extinguish Loki's catastrophic plan.The most intriguing part of the movie, aside from the fight scenes, are the character dynamics. Joss Whedon does such a good job making the banter and interactions between these superheros feel real. The snide remarks and off comments felt genuine. Complement to all the actors involved who took this dialog and delivered. The movie is endlessly quotable and everyone will find a character than can truly enjoy.Speaking of the fight scenes, they were absolutely fantastic. The battles were large scale fought between numerous superheros and army's of bad guys. There was carnage throughout and it was a sight to behold. There are even times when there is a little in fighting amongst the Avengers and it's quite a treat.The Avengers was a case of every single person doing their job and doing it at the highest standard. Whedon with his direction, Downey Jr. with his cocky demeanor, and Hemmsworth with his Goldiness. Even Mark Ruffalo stepped in a filled in the Hulk's shoes nicely.

At some point in the average persons life they have heard of Captain America, Iron Man, Hawkeye, The Hulk or the God of lightening, Thor. These characters have been apart of the American culture for decades and at last they all come to life. This movie highly recommended as a must see. It has all the elements for a nonstop, action-packed family movie. It is shear genius that the plot for this film be intertwined and ran off from the other previous movies that the Avengers starred in individually.

2020-05-25,"SYNOPSIS:
Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is searching for the tesseract so he can bring back to his leader and in return, rule planet Earth. It's up to The Avengers to learn how to work together and stop this attack.REVIEW:
The title of this review only makes sense if you've seen the film. Anyone who reads this has probably seen the film, but I digress. If you read the review I made for Iron Man, you know I said how important that film was to the future of the MCU and how important it was that it was a good film. The Avengers just proved, even more so, that the MCU was going to be successful and have great longevity. Just like the super teams LeBron forms (not to compare LeBron's lack of finals success without 2 other superstars with heroism) there are plenty of underlying issues that the group need to handle before they can properly execute. Yes, these are films about people with superhuman abilities and so that itself is unrealistic, however, they make it believable in the sense that if it were a real possibility, I can see things play out this way. Egos colliding. Selfishness, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), and selflessness, Steve Rodgers (Chris Evans), collide and you feel the tension. This film has some very good writing and directing work from Joss Whedon. One sequence in particular, when you see Loki walking down the hall looking through glass to see Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo). This causes you to put two and two together and get one of those ""ohhhh s***"" moments. Those are always great as an audience member. We're naturally observant and curious creatures who like to try and solve things. So that's delivered very well. We're introduced to Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk for the first time in this film. I'm not so sure I liked how they made him seem a bit full of himself in this film. Although, I end up liking Ruffalo as Banner more in the long run, I like how the character was portrayed a little more by Edward Norton than in this film. We get introduced a bit more to Hawkeye and Black Widow in this film, which was good as they are more side characters, but play a huge role as members of The Avengers. This film had great execution of conflict, it had tense moments and some very funny moment with an overall of good balance.

2014-04-10,"I'm writing this review in response to a lot of the backlash that seems to be happening in the reviews. Despite being the third highest grossing movie of all time, receiving critical acclaim and being in the IMDb Top 250, people in the reviews have been slamming this movie. Why? Not Dark and Gritting Enough? I Loved the Dark Knight but not every movie has to follow that formula (see Amazing Spider-Man, Man Of Steel). No one said this movie was The Godfather or Citizen Kane, because it doesn't have to be! All it has to do is entertain, and it does that in bucketloads. I remember leaving the theater and already I Couldn't wait for the second one. Joss Whedon is one of the greatest writers in the industry (see Buffy, Firefly etc.) and knows his comics (see his run on Astonishing X- Men and Runaways) making him the perfect choice for this movie. It has action and humor and all you could want from a blockbuster movie. Granted, it looks better on the Big Screen, in which case this review is too late, but none the less, if you're a fan of blockbuster movies this is the cream of the crop.

2016-04-16,"The good - One of my favorite comic book movies of all time. It has amazing action scenes (the ""one take"" shot that shows what each hero is doing during the Battle of New York still makes me want to cheer), great ensemble chemistry, and a sense of fun that is supported by some dramatic tension. It captures the spirit perfectly and builds upon characters that were introduced in the previous MCU movies. Hard to believe that the only major character that was given any kind of introduction in this movie was Maria Hill.The great - Ruffalo pulls off the best Bruce Banner ever to hit the screen. Perfect blend of smart ass, smart scientist, and asshole. And the Hulk was wildly fun as well.The surprising - Of all the movies I have re-watched in this series, this one seems to have been most impacted (negatively) by the future MCU stories. (*MILD SPOILERS AHEAD*) The death of a major figure loses some of its impact, as you know he will be coming back and it undercuts some of the darkness and drama that my original watchings conveyed.Summary - Still amazingly fun, and, by far, the best live-action comic book ensemble movie ever made and worth watching again and again., The Avengers has DC desperate to catch up and create their own DCCU, but I am not convinced Batman vs Superman will ever live up to this. Joss Whedon created an experience that was an amazing way to end Phase 1 and set us up for Phase 2!",10.0,2016-04,Saturday,"action:0.07, again:0.13, all:0.06, am:0.07, amazing:0.12, an:0.08, and:0.26, any:0.06, as:0.07, avengers:0.03, back:0.07, banner:0.06, batman:0.08, battle:0.07, be:0.04, been:0.05, believe:0.08, best:0.09, book:0.12, bruce:0.07, but:0.03, by:0.13, character:0.05, characters:0.04, comic:0.11, coming:0.08, each:0.05, end:0.06, ensemble:0.18, ever:0.17, experience:0.08, far:0.07, favorite:0.08, for:0.03, fun:0.18, given:0.08, good:0.04, great:0.08, hard:0.07, has:0.08, have:0.07, he:0.05, hero:0.06, hulk:0.04, in:0.08, is:0.05, it:0.08, its:0.05, joss:0.05, kind:0.08, know:0.06, made:0.05, makes:0.06, mcu:0.17, me:0.05, most:0.05, movie:0.06, movies:0.13, my:0.09, new:0.06, not:0.03, of:0.24, off:0.06, one:0.10, only:0.05, original:0.09, own:0.07, perfect:0.07, perfectly:0.08, previous:0.07, re:0.07, ruffalo:0.06, scenes:0.05, screen:0.06, seems:0.08, sense:0.08, series:0.08, set:0.08, some:0.14, still:0.12, take:0.07, that:0.20, the:0.39, their:0.05, this:0.10, time:0.04, to:0.17, up:0.13, us:0.08, want:0.07, was:0.13, watched:0.07, watching:0.06, way:0.05, well:0.04, were:0.05, what:0.04, whedon:0.05, will:0.09, worth:0.07, york:0.09, you:0.04"
2014-02-11,"Avengers, is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.1 It is the sixth installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film is written and directed by Joss Whedon and features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgård and Samuel L. Jackson. In the film, Nick Fury, director of the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor's adoptive brother Loki from subjugating Earth. The film's development began when Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch in April 2005. After the success of the film Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel announced that The Avengers would be released in July 2011. With the signing of Johansson in March 2009, the film was pushed back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by Zak Penn. Production began in April 2011 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving to Cleveland, Ohio, in August and New York City in September.

2016-08-07,"So Marvel finally decided to bring all its superheroes together. Something that I had been waiting for from a long time. Until now there were only independent stories for each of the superheroes.The Avengers, directed by Joss Whedon, is the very first movie from Marvel that unites all the heroes into one great action packed movie. The movie brings Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Dr. Bruce Banner aka Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) together to save the Earth from the actions of the Norse God Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The story is similar to other superhero movies with the general ""save the earth from danger"" plot. Even though it may have a simple plot however it does have some amazing action sequences and impressive special effects like the much more realistic Hulk, who (through motion capture technology) finally looks like the actor playing him. The interaction between the superheroes as the movie progressed was also something to watch out for. It had great performances by all the actors, good humor, and many others which I will leave as a mystery. Avengers is a general sci-fi, superhero movie, but it sets the stage for more eye-catching sequels to follow.According to me what Whedon and Marvel have created here is one of the most entertaining and satisfying comic book movies yet. This movie is a must watch for the Marvel fans out there.

2022-06-08,"The avenger is a critical movie for the superhero genre in general. And hasn't aged poorly at all, despite being released 10 years ago. The movie may be simple, but its simplicity became a core to hold the foundation of superhero films. From the action, different character interactions, and even a little bit of light-hearted comedy. But since this was the first time the Avengers were meeting, simplicity was really what the movie needed. The film emphasized the chemistry each character had in the movie more than you expected. This was a great plan so you can fully see the Avengers as a real team. This movie is meant for the entire family to watch, and the film has excellent replay value.

2012-05-04,"I have been very excited for this movie to come out. Being pleased with the other Marvel movies such as Iron man, Thor, etc. I couldn't help but get excited for this one as well. By the time the last credit rolled, I left feeling only half satisfied. On the good side of the movie, amazing CGI, it really was all brought together well creating exciting action sequences. The acting was pretty good also, it was the same old characters we learned to love and adore. But the thing that stuck out the most to me was Mark Ruffalo's Hulk. He brought the character to life and to be quite honest, I didn't really care much for the Hulk until this movie.Now on the other hand, there was a down side to this movie. The movie just seemed to drag on. Almost as if they were building up the characters all over again, but they already had their own movie, so why? Also, and I know I wasn't the only one on this, but the whole story line was to cliché. Bottom line, it was a really good movie, top ten no, top 50 yes.

Joss Whedon was able to flawlessly bring these characters together and give them some excellent interactions. A sign of his genius is how he took Black Widow, my least favorite character from Iron Man 2, and made her one of my favorite Marvel characters. He was also able to give us the best portrayal of the Hulk. Loki also had some great scenes and some great lines. In fact, I think he was the strongest element of this movie. The music is, for some reason, quite average though. This is a movie one can rewatch again and again. It's an all around enjoyable film with great, unique characters, great dialogue, a cohesive plot, and fantastic action.

2013-05-02,"Storytelling as an art? What's that? And, who cares anyway? When Hollywood makes tons of money off of bad movies, then where's the financial incentive to make decent films? 2012 is turning out to the worst year in decades - and I have been going to the movies for over 40 years, so that's saying something - for really bad blockbusters: first, Hunger Games; next, Dark Shadows; and now The Avengers!I am so sick and tired of New York City, specifically the island of Manhattan, being attacked in the movies. Hello! It was attacked in real life only a little over 10 years ago costing the lives of over 3,000+ real people, including my brother's co-worker, co-worker's wife and unborn child! But what is really despicable is that at the very end of the The Avengers you briefly get to see a real-life news photo from 9/11 mourning the dead. That's just plain, disgusting exploitation! But lets not stop there! At the end of the film we get to briefly hear a local New York State Senator rant about how our Avenger heroes ""wrecked Manhattan."" That our heroes who just risked their lives in a 1,000+ ways are to ""blame"" for all the destruction! Fine! I agree many politicians are real jerks, but to put the letter ""D"" for Democrat next to this Senator's name speaks volumes about the films real message: Democrats holding elective office are nothing more than ungrateful, winy creeps! That's real cute! I thought Hollywood was sooooooo liberal! If you going to interject politics into a film then why not put a ""R"" for Republicans after the Senator's name? After all, the Republicans in Congress fought tooth and nail to prevent the establishment of a Federally funded medical fund for First Responders whose health was permanently impaired by breathing in all the toxic debris that was released into the air! The Avengers is also plain boring with the most two-dimensional characters in the history of film making! Sure I wanted the good guys to win! Sure the guys have cute muscles and the gals are all pretty! But, really now, who cares when there is zero character development and the storyline is about as exciting as watching Frosty The Snowman for the tenth time! The last third of the Avengers is nothing more than war porn! I will never watch another super hero movie that has a character from The Avengers as long as I live! Even for free, or if Hollywood offers me a million dollars! Overall, Hollywood has done a decent job with the X-men and the Fanatic Four, but for some reason the right-wing kooks who control the Avenger characters have turned them into nothing more than an exploitative moneymaking machine. No wonder why Stan Lee was so happy in his cameo appearance at the end of the film! It's just too bad he and the rest of Hollywood has to stoop so low to make a buck! For those of you who have never taken a film class in college before: A GOOD FILM HAS AN INTERESTING STORY AND ACTORS THAT INTERACT WELL WITH EACH OTHER! It really is not too hard to imagine!

2013-01-12,"For fans of the comic books, it's a dream come true. For die-hard action fans it something you have never been prepared for.... The sheer special-effects and solid script work effortlessly and make this film work. Two characters I feel carry this film: Iron Man & Captain America. The two have male ego problems, conflict of moralities and this can be seen in the film.I have given a rating of 10 for Special Effects and Script. There are some actors that would have sunk this film, if not for the majority of decent acting by both Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Samuel Jackson. For once in his life Chris Hemsworth does not f*ck it up.The liabilities in this film are: Jeremy Renner, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo. But they just merely cause a dent in the armour, nothing more.Before you see this film you should already have seen: Iron Man 1 & 2, The Hulk & The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger and Thor. This will give you a background into these characters.Plot: Nick Fury is director of S.H.I.E.L.D, an international peace keeping agency. The agency is a who's who of Marvel Super Heroes, with Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow. When global security is threatened by Loki and his cohorts, Nick Fury and his team will need all their powers to save the world from disaster.

2012-09-09,"Aside from The Dark Knight Rises, this was probably the most waited movie of the year, was it the movie of the year? No, but it was still fantastic. Up there, there's a not very certain rate of this movie, but here's a true review of this movie. The Avengers was not so good as I expected to be, that I can admit, but I still loved it, I admired that Joss Whedon did a great job with the characters screen time, it all had a balance, so no character seems distant, that was a very important element of the movie, and they succeeded at not blow it up, that was a great thing they did. The Avengers is the reunion of Marvel's greatest heroes (Yeah, unfortunately there's no Spider man, well, he's probably only amazing for them and they needed great), so this movie needed memorable action scenes. Well, along the movie, there's some great action scenes, but they can't be compared to what they saved for the end, it was almost 20 minutes of fantastic action scenes, featuring Iron Man (at his best), Thor, Captain America, The Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye. The special effects were tremendous, as they shoul be and they brought a very significant and pleasunt quantity of humour in this movie, that was really helpful and enjoyable.Downey once again suits up as Iron Man, and he was amazing once again, bringing to the screen he's amazing sense of humour and smartness. Chris Evans wasn't at Donwey's same calibre, but he was still solid. Mark Ruffalo was amazing as The Hulk, his performance was very solid. Chris Hemsworth fired some good jokes along the movie, nothing more than that, I don't appreciate Thor that much. Scarlett Johansson was amazing and hot here as the Black Widow, which is a really strong character, by the way. Jeremy Renner was too distant, Tom Hiddleston wasn't an amazing choise to play the villain, Clark Gregg was great, Cobie Smulders was a surprise, I was seeing Robin turning into a serious secret agent, oh and L. Jackson was also great with his Nick Fury.Overall, The Avengers is a great blockbuster, that didn't fail, Whedon's direction made this happening so good. Of course the story isn't amazing, they didn't care about an amazing story, only the union of these heroes. But The Avengers is not a perfect fairy tale, it also has its flaws, like, the long second act that was mostly placed at a submarine and weird enemies that bored he viewer when shown, but aside from that, The Avengers is a fantastic movie, that succeeds at uniting all these heroes together amazingly, it was amazing to seem all work together, The Avengers is not easily forgotten.

2012-05-13,"No, I don't think The Avengers is entirely horrible: in fact, it's a perfectly decent escapist type movie, but don't expect to walk away from the theatre with a new found love for life or a fresh perspective that any real movie will deliver. The Avengers is the current water-cooler movie, for good reason: it's easy to talk about. ""The CGI!"" ""The action!"" ""The comedy!"". It's easy, and might as well have a laugh track it's so instructive. From start to finish, the plot carries the same formula - INYOURFACEACTION, comic relief, INYOURFACEACTION, comic relief. Repeat until done. The jokes were painfully predictive and obvious; I felt like cattle being herded along the movie, all too aware of the cheap tricks used to get the audience laughing. At a budget of over 200 million, it felt cheap and without substance.I also think it's insulting this movie carries such a high IMDb rating.

2021-03-23,"There's not much to say that everybody else has said about this movie. the Avengers came out it broke ground breaking records in the genre of superhero films. not just focusing on just one hero but overall building up to multiple heroes to bring an epic superhero team to film. showing off that achievement you have some of marvels most iconic heroes here on the big screen. Having films previously introduced each character, this film still takes the time to give each avenger enough screen time to develop. it's not that they just jump into the idea of being a group of superheroes like there's a lot of debate and argue amongst one another to see if they're even capable of being heroes. The idea of a team of superheroes does not just happen and they have to decide if there capable of it. I need to find that final spark to finally push them. The rivalry between Captain America and Iron Man plays off of polar opposites repelling, one another similar in duality like Batman and Superman both represent different ways of being a hero. Black widow and Hawkeye both agents of shield highly train fighters, tacticians& killers however one thing to be said that Hawkeye being in the control of Loki the majority of the film does not really give you much to go off of the character. Same with Natasha here you don't really know that much about her. Bruce Banner's biggest gripe is that he does not even wanna be here, and he does not want to fight. always though he's forced into situations that he doesn't really have a choice in the matter. His transformation into the hulk is something that's build up to when it finally does finally come it is satisfying. Thor dialogue wise is not the most interest interesting but when he's but when his fighting do come he is magnificent his fight with Tony his fight with hulk and the big finale in New York. The choice of the villain Loki was an appropriate choice not only did Tom Hiddleston bring his mischievous performance from Thor. He uses it well his like charm to pin the avengers against one another. but it's also symbolic given how when the avengers first day debut in the comics the first villain that they faced was Loki. Soundtrack by Alan Silverti has become iconic will go down along side the Danny Elfman Batman and John Williams superman themes.

2016-05-23,"Good: Incredible special effects, action sequences, and just a thrilling ride throughout. Robert Downey Jr. is a great actor with lots of charisma, and I don't even like Iron Man. Captain America has a lot of appeal as well. Banner is good too. What this movie lacks in serious depth it makes up in acting and aesthetics.Bad: As usual of Marvel films, the humor is misplaced and at times excessive. It makes the film lose it's seriousness and the sequences are no longer gripping. And that scene where Hulk randomly smacks Thor. Is that supposed to be humorous?

2013-09-10,"Bringing Earths mightiest heroes together was a brilliant idea as I have never seen a better superhero movie like it, And in the bright, action world of Marvel. Watch the heroes do whats best from each individual as they all have their fair share of screen time such as Iron man being cocky, Captain America being heroic, Thor bringing the lightning and of course... Hulk Smash. I couldn't hate a minuet of it and its always a great film when you want to see more at the end.The only criticism I could barely dig out from the depths of my thoughts was Stan Lee could of had a better cameo but sometimes life doesn't go that way. But if you can get over a 89 year old man having a short part that lasted 4 seconds then you will appreciate this amazing film.

2020-06-20,"I enjoyed the movies leading up to this. The formula was getting familiar with Captain America but the characters were good so who cares? I was really excited to see where they were going to take these movies. Because no one had ever done this connected thing before and they were slowly taking their time. And it was working!So finally the movie that connected everything was here and the whole world is onboard and watching and what are they going to do? The same old thing. Exactly what they had done in the other movies. Same old generic structure, themes, action, dialogue, jokes and story. Absolutely nothing new. I don't know what I was expecting the comics are all the same too.They don't take any risks or try anything different. And they really went for it in this one by having things happen that don't make any sense. Like in the beginning Banner can't control the Hulk. Then at the end he can? With no explanation? What? Out of all the stuff I see nerds complain about and that actual plot hole goes unnoticed? Then with other movies nerds complain about innocent people being killed? They take out half of New York City! But nobody complains in this movie? I know there's other dumb stuff but my brain forgot about it to make way for useless knowledge of good movies.I understand these movies being big for boys under 17 but come on? So many people plug their nose and swallow this mindless crap without question. And Disney has the power to do anything that they want and they don't use it. They don't try something new. They use cheap tricks to make movies satisfying on a cheap emotional level to get people to enjoy them. And they have dominated the box office for 10 years and they aren't using that responsibility to do anything good. They could be getting a great message out there but no. Same old crap. Why because it works. And they'll only do something new if someone else does it first.Didn't they have Black Widow around forever? And when did they decide to give her here own movie? Oh yeah after DC made Wonder Woman and it was a huge hit.This was really the beginning of Disney ruining the blockbuster. And somehow you tools let it happen.

2012-05-03,"I'd give it an 8.5, perhaps because all the hype is really difficult to live up to. Except for one scene, everyone but me seems to enjoy the humor. I disliked the Iron Man movies for the same reason and would prefer a more serious tone. The choice was however financially smart. Contrary to popular opinion, I also prefer the old Nick Fury from the original Marvel continuity. The action becomes a little repetitive towards the end since suspending disbelief that any of the heroes could ever seriously get hurt or die is impossible. Yes, all the characters are given time to shine and I've always trusted the director's name. He takes pains to explain everything, including why most of the heroes who are supposed to be masked are out strutting their actor's faces around the whole movie (which they wouldn't do in the comics). In spite of watching this expensive spectacle on 2D, I was surprised to notice a few background scenes that looked fake. I hope they make JLA darker, but given the success template of the Avengers and the greater prevalence of humor in JLA comics, that would be unlikely.

2012-11-15,"The Avengers is the story of a group of superheroes who are forced to come together to save the planet from the God of mischief Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Who happens to be the brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth). The team made up of Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr), Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), The Hulk/Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Hawkeye/Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), and Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), and directed by Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson). Loki has come to earth seeking to control the human race with the help of an object known as the Tesseract and is not to be taken likely. Not even his brother Thor can stop his madness. The Avengers must defend the world from Loki's reign and despite their differences and pent up tension towards each other, come together to make sure that the world stays safe.The movie pretty much goes along with the comic books throughout the entire thing. However, I wish that Loki would have been portrayed just a little bit differently. In the comics, he's a crazy God obsessed with his power and causing absolute chaos and ruin. Tom Hiddleston makes a good Loki, but I feel as though if he had made him just a tad more crazy, he would have made a better Loki. Because really, he's the God of mischief. Asgard's own trickster. Not the God of pity or self-loathing.The graphics are really eye popping and keep the movie more real feeling. There is a part where Thor, Captain America, and Black Widow are all on the streets and this explosion happens directly behind them. The color of the flames made your eyes immediately go to the explosion, then the movement in Black Widow's hair draws your eyes from the flame to her, and from there out to the other characters surrounding her.The storyline flows really nice as well. Going from one point to the next without making you wonder what the heck is going on. There may be one or two points that may becoming confusing for someone who hasn't read the comics or seen the previous Marvel movies, but overall the story is pretty easy to follow.The Avengers to me is a must see movie even if you aren't a huge super hero fan. It's filled with a suspenseful story line, eye pleasing graphics,an excellent cast of actors, and lives up to its hype.",9.0,2012-11,Thursday,"actors:0.04, all:0.02, along:0.05, america:0.06, an:0.05, and:0.19, are:0.07, as:0.07, avengers:0.07, banner:0.04, be:0.07, because:0.04, been:0.03, better:0.04, bit:0.05, black:0.11, brother:0.10, bruce:0.04, but:0.04, by:0.03, can:0.03, captain:0.06, cast:0.04, characters:0.03, chris:0.09, come:0.12, comic:0.03, comics:0.09, downey:0.04, each:0.04, earth:0.04, entire:0.06, evans:0.04, even:0.07, excellent:0.05, fan:0.04, feel:0.04, for:0.02, from:0.13, fury:0.04, go:0.04, god:0.20, goes:0.06, going:0.08, good:0.03, group:0.05, had:0.03, has:0.03, have:0.05, hawkeye:0.04, he:0.12, help:0.06, hemsworth:0.05, her:0.11, hero:0.04, hiddleston:0.09, him:0.04, his:0.09, however:0.05, huge:0.05, hulk:0.03, hype:0.05, if:0.06, in:0.04, iron:0.03, is:0.10, it:0.02, its:0.04, jackson:0.04, jeremy:0.05, johansson:0.04, jr:0.04, just:0.05, keep:0.05, line:0.05, little:0.04, loki:0.19, made:0.14, make:0.04, makes:0.04, making:0.05, man:0.03, mark:0.04, marvel:0.03, may:0.10, me:0.03, more:0.06, movie:0.06, movies:0.03, much:0.03, must:0.09, next:0.05, nice:0.06, nick:0.04, not:0.07, of:0.16, on:0.05, one:0.05, or:0.09, other:0.06, out:0.03, overall:0.05, own:0.04, part:0.05, point:0.05, power:0.06, pretty:0.09, previous:0.05, read:0.06, real:0.05, really:0.09, renner:0.05, robert:0.04, ruffalo:0.04, samuel:0.05, save:0.06, scarlett:0.04, see:0.03, seen:0.04, stark:0.04, stop:0.05, story:0.09, storyline:0.06, super:0.04, superheroes:0.04, sure:0.05, team:0.04, tesseract:0.06, that:0.06, the:0.53, their:0.03, them:0.03, then:0.04, there:0.08, thing:0.04, this:0.02, thor:0.09, though:0.05, throughout:0.06, to:0.23, together:0.06, tom:0.09, tony:0.05, two:0.04, up:0.09, well:0.03, what:0.03, where:0.04, who:0.10, widow:0.11, with:0.08, without:0.05, world:0.08, would:0.06, you:0.05, your:0.08"

2013-06-30,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningNick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), head of defence agency S.H.E.I.L.D., is thrown into action when a powerful device called The Tesseract is stolen by Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the renegade son of Odin and a wicked God banished for his nature. He calls all the superheroes together from around the globe to unite as one to save the Earth. But upon Loki's capture, they start to question their assignment and whether they're being told the whole truth.Superhero movies seem to be the in thing at the moment, the big studios still requiring a guaranteed fan base and surefire box office return in these recessionary times. And so some bright spark in the marketing department had the foresight to imagine them all coming together as one, supposing the ardent fans would go crazy and flock in droves to the theatres to catch it. While personally I prefer the action films more grounded in reality, there is still a young boy in me who can still find an appeal in the flashy suits and fantasy adventure. It says a lot that Avengers Assemble, where all the big Marvel comics names (with the exception, sadly, of The Punisher whose antics would probably have been too violent for a family film) manages to be more of an exhilarating thrill ride than all the films from recent times that inspired it.Joss Whedon has crafted a colourful, flashy sensory extravaganza that brings the characters to life in ways none of their first recent outings could and never manages to drag at quite a bit over two hours. Working together as one, the gang manage to be more effective than they ever could on their lonesomes, forging an unwitting chemistry together as events roll on, while you can never shake the feeling there's a part of them that would still like to rip each other's throats out. Luckily, Whedon never forgets to inject the script with flashes of humour at regular intervals, resulting in material that never takes itself too seriously (unlike maybe some of the original films), which sets it on the right track.While the all star cast all manage to bring their respective characters to life in their own way, it's probably Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man who steals the show, firing off a wise cracking charisma through out that makes him stand out, while Scarlett Johansson is an alluring femme fatale, and Hiddleston is a hissable villain. Meanwhile, other big name stars like Jeremy Renner and Mark Ruffalo are pushed further back and occupy less screen time. But casting aside, the main thing here, the action and special effects, are appropriately spectacular and round off probably the most satisfying film I've seen in this series. ****",9.0,2013-06,Sunday,"action:0.07, all:0.13, an:0.11, and:0.19, are:0.05, around:0.05, as:0.11, assemble:0.05, at:0.08, avengers:0.02, back:0.05, be:0.07, been:0.03, being:0.04, big:0.12, bit:0.05, bring:0.06, brings:0.06, but:0.04, by:0.03, can:0.06, cast:0.04, characters:0.05, comics:0.05, coming:0.06, could:0.07, downey:0.04, each:0.04, earth:0.05, effects:0.04, ever:0.04, fan:0.04, fans:0.05, film:0.05, films:0.11, find:0.05, first:0.03, for:0.04, from:0.05, fury:0.04, go:0.04, god:0.05, had:0.03, has:0.03, have:0.02, he:0.03, here:0.04, hiddleston:0.09, him:0.04, his:0.03, hours:0.06, humour:0.06, in:0.20, into:0.04, iron:0.03, is:0.09, it:0.09, itself:0.06, jackson:0.05, jeremy:0.05, johansson:0.04, joss:0.04, jr:0.04, less:0.06, life:0.10, like:0.05, loki:0.06, lot:0.04, main:0.05, makes:0.04, man:0.03, mark:0.04, marvel:0.03, maybe:0.05, me:0.03, moment:0.06, more:0.09, most:0.04, movies:0.03, never:0.16, of:0.13, off:0.08, on:0.07, one:0.07, original:0.06, other:0.06, out:0.09, over:0.04, own:0.05, part:0.05, probably:0.15, quite:0.05, rating:0.06, re:0.05, renner:0.05, right:0.05, robert:0.04, ruffalo:0.04, samuel:0.05, save:0.06, scarlett:0.04, screen:0.04, script:0.05, seem:0.06, seen:0.04, series:0.06, show:0.05, so:0.03, some:0.06, special:0.04, spectacular:0.06, stand:0.06, star:0.11, stark:0.04, stars:0.06, start:0.05, still:0.16, superhero:0.03, superheroes:0.04, takes:0.06, tesseract:0.06, than:0.07, that:0.12, the:0.47, their:0.16, them:0.06, there:0.06, these:0.04, they:0.08, thing:0.09, this:0.02, through:0.05, time:0.03, times:0.10, to:0.25, together:0.13, tom:0.04, tony:0.05, too:0.07, two:0.05, ve:0.04, villain:0.04, way:0.04, whedon:0.07, when:0.03, where:0.04, which:0.03, while:0.18, who:0.06, whole:0.05, with:0.04, would:0.10, you:0.02"
2024-05-25,"The AvengersAt long last, the first phase of the MCU comes together in the sixth film, the Avengers. Long time fans of the superhero team got their patience rewarded. Marvel's creative team really shines here as they paid so much attention to the details from the source material and their own films.What I loved most about this movie is that they continued all the stories of the first 5 films in this one without making the audience feel that there was too much going on. Maria Hill is also introduced, increasing the character appearances. Even Natalie Portman's face appears as Jane on a screen showing that she wasn't forgotten about either.We learn so much more about the characters and what it's like to see them struggle to work as a team. And Loki knew that would happen. The theme of linking strengths and not flexing ego is explored in depth all while Loki exploits it to his very successful advantage. Think about this for a minute. Loki's plan required a great deal of ""distraction"" that an ensorcelled Hawkeye asked for. Had the squabbling not taken place, I see a much different ending.Knowing what we know comes later, it is even more painful knowing that maybe we need to take a step back and not just assume all will be well because they're superheroes.I remember seeing Thanos for those 2 seconds at the end of the movie and becoming lost in magical wonder about what Marvel would do with the stories I knew. Years and years of joy were to follow but I didn't know that. I just knew that my 30 something year old body still was a kid enjoying these cosmic adventures.Stan Lee dismissing superheroes in New York is funny but not that funny haha. I loved the shawarma scene at the end of the credits and I love that you can buy them at Disney California Adventure. They're good too!Since I am reviewing the film by itself, I'll stop here but from here on out, the films get very intertwined and it'll be more difficult to do that.

2012-05-13,"For those of you who are looking for more than just action sequences, this is going to be a very long film for you; my advice is: visit the restroom as often as you'd like, don't torture yourself.Take away the very predictable first 45 minutes of team assembly and the final 45 minutes of predictable one-sided mano-a-mano, there's still 50 minutes in the middle to put together a decent story. But when all is said and done, you'll find it's impossible to describe what the movie was really about. After all, no one ever promised it's a movie about anything.Worry not though, no one is ever going to ask you about the storyline. Your sole responsibility is to remember the details of the special effects e.g. how the smoke coming out of a broken rotating blade is sucked back into it.

2018-12-06,"A repost from an old IMDB review.I'm happy to report that everything established in previous movies pays dividends in a big way. It's not that anyone needs to see those other Avenger solo films before seeing this gem but it certainly adds depth and texture to this amazing product. Not having to intro big main characters deeply allows the action to flow but also allows for better development. This also allows them to probe deeper into the character's personalities. This heightens the tension, so often missing from comic-book movies, and adds real weight to the story as well as the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing. The result is a film that's just flat out exceptional.Of course all the phenomenal heroes got to shine and the story accommodated them all perfectly. What I loved is that Marvel did it again with their main villain. Loki was just so wonderful and complex in this amazing movie. Spurned Loki masterfully dances on the fault lines of villainy and redemption. He always keep people guessing and. Again, that's just shear perfection coming from the god of mischief. He has such a mixture of emotional psychological complexity. You have somebody who's capable of thinking and strategizing at the speed of light, but underneath that is a deep well of pain that at any moment threatens to boil over and Tom Hiddleston plays it like the master he has become. This is Oscar worthy villain performance good.The performances in this movie are as good as any I've ever seen in an adventure film. The great actors say that acting akin to playing tennis. The rally that they play with a new partner is completely different from one to the other. Each of these GREAT actors have such specific talents that it's fun to see them play off each other at different times in this movie. I think Whedon realized this as both director and writer and shuffled things around on purpose to play to strengths.

However, Avengers really changed that and provided a Marvel movie that could go toe to toe with the best of other comic book adaptations.This is one of the best superhero movies I have ever seen. Certainly the best Marvel has put out. The jokes are hilarious, the action is intense. Every character, even Loki and Nick Fury, have scenes that give us insights into their characters.

2013-09-22,"The Avengers delivers on being a great superhero movie with quality special effects and an entertaining plot while also making the audience laugh throughout the entire movie. The opening scene causes suspense with a very dark scene of Loki being given his scepter by his master. It also shows their creepy looking army and their goal of capturing the Tesseract, a cube of great power. The line of ""What can the humans do but burn"" foreshadows that they are going attack the humans. Loki uses his scepter and the power of the Tesseract to teleport from Asgard to Earth. He then steals the Tesseract from the humans. This causes the director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury, to call together all of the world's superheroes. These heroes are Iron Man, the Hulk, Captain America, Hawkeye, Thor, and Black Widow and they try to stop Loki and his Chitauri army from taking over the world while also dealing with internal conflicts between heroes. The introduction of the Avengers is very well done because they show each one being recruited back into the Avengers. They do a great job of incorporating the backstories of each one by referencing their individual movies. The dialogue is used to explain each hero's background to the audience so it would appeal to everyone and not just hardcore comic and superhero fans. Flashbacks are used to explain some details of the past histories of the characters. Loki and Captain America both have flashbacks and Captain America's shows his past experience with the Tesserract. The special effects are used to make the sci-fi parts of the movie seem possible. The blue cube of the Tesseract is beautifully created with blue swirls inside of it. The transformation of Bruce Banner into the Hulk is very well done with him going mad and then slowly growing into the Hulk and the Hulk looks giant, ripped and very green when he is smashing everything. The futuristic looking ships and aircraft are made to look very complex by having very detailed electronic and mechanical parts and the helicarrier is a great example because it is an aircraft carrier that turns into a flying helicopter ship with four giant engines. The movie also includes plenty of comic relief. Phil Coulson is asking Captain America if he will sign his vintage collection of Captain America cards every time he sees him. There is a great moment when one of the workers on the helicarrier is playing galaga instead of working and Tony Stark calls him out for it. The constant references of modern things, like Stephen Hawking, made to Captain America are funny because he doesn't understand any of them. Some of the most memorable moments are comic relief moments with Captain America ordering Hulk to smash before the final battle and when Loki gives his little speech to the Hulk and then the Hulk picks him up and smashes him into the ground multiple times. The Avengers shows that superhero movies can also be funny.",9.0,2013-09,Sunday,"all:0.02, also:0.13, america:0.16, an:0.04, and:0.24, any:0.03, are:0.13, army:0.08, audience:0.08, avengers:0.07, back:0.03, banner:0.03, battle:0.03, be:0.02, because:0.08, before:0.03, being:0.09, between:0.03, black:0.03, both:0.04, bruce:0.03, but:0.02, by:0.07, can:0.04, captain:0.16, characters:0.02, comic:0.08, dark:0.04, dialogue:0.04, director:0.03, do:0.05, doesn:0.04, done:0.07, each:0.08, earth:0.03, effects:0.05, entertaining:0.03, entire:0.04, every:0.03, everyone:0.03, everything:0.03, experience:0.04, fans:0.03, final:0.04, for:0.01, four:0.05, from:0.06, funny:0.07, fury:0.03, given:0.04, going:0.06, great:0.11, have:0.02, having:0.04, hawkeye:0.03, he:0.11, hero:0.03, heroes:0.05, him:0.16, his:0.16, hulk:0.13, if:0.02, individual:0.04, instead:0.04, into:0.13, iron:0.02, is:0.13, it:0.06, job:0.03, just:0.02, like:0.02, line:0.04, little:0.03, loki:0.12, look:0.04, looking:0.08, looks:0.04, made:0.05, make:0.03, making:0.04, man:0.02, moment:0.04, moments:0.07, most:0.03, movie:0.06, movies:0.04, nick:0.03, not:0.02, of:0.28, on:0.04, one:0.05, out:0.02, over:0.03, parts:0.09, past:0.09, plot:0.03, power:0.08, scene:0.07, seem:0.04, show:0.04, so:0.02, some:0.04, special:0.06, stark:0.03, stop:0.04, superhero:0.07, superheroes:0.03, tesseract:0.17, that:0.04, the:0.53, their:0.07, them:0.02, then:0.09, there:0.02, these:0.03, they:0.08, things:0.04, this:0.01, thor:0.02, throughout:0.04, time:0.02, times:0.04, to:0.16, together:0.02, tony:0.03, understand:0.04, up:0.02, used:0.13, very:0.14, well:0.04, what:0.02, when:0.07, while:0.07, widow:0.03, will:0.02, with:0.12, world:0.06, would:0.02"

2016-05-05,"After a superhero Thors evil brother Loki gains control of the tesseract, he becomes a threat to earth. The director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury, organizes the superhero group known as the avengers to stop him.The avengers was produced by Joss Whedon. The movie came out in 2012. The avengers is a very exciting movie with really good fighting scenes in it. The avengers movie is about Loki and his army fighting against the Avengers for the tesseract in new York city. The tesseract is an unlimited energy power source. S.H.I.E.L.D. found the tesseract deep in the ocean at the same time when they found Captain America in the ocean. Loki having the tesseract would be very dangerous to earth so nick fury got the avengers together to stop him. The avengers consist of iron man, captain America, hulk, thor, black widow, and hulk eye.In the movie, I liked all of the special effects. The backgrounds music and sound effects were also good. The graphics in the movie were also very good and made the movie better.A major theme in this movie is heroism. Through out the movie, the avengers members were trying to protect every one on earth. Since the movie takes place in new York city, there were many people who lived in new York city who could have been hurt but many of them weren't injured at all because the avengers protected them. Overall, this movie is very good. I've seen this movie many of times and I never get tired of watching it. If you like action movies, then I suggest you watch this movie.

2014-04-12,"The Avengers is an action-packed, superhero-filled film that focuses on the peace-keeping S.H.I.E.L.D agency, bringing together Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to create the Avengers. When Earth is threatened by Thor's brother Loki the Avengers must unite to save the planet from catastrophe. Full of impressive visuals and action in nearly every scene, this film is fast paced and exciting throughout with plenty to keep you guessing. The final battle is epic in every sense: impressive CGI mixes with the New York skyline as the Avengers lead the fight against evil in a thrilling chase across the city. The story itself pulls in elements from each of the individual Avenger's stories, in particular Iron Man (2008), Thor (2011) and Captain America (2011) (I may be slightly biased in saying this as they are my favourite Avengers so I notice the references more) and I'd highly recommend watching the individual films, although they are not a necessary prerequisite. The casting is first class. Each character is a contrast to the next; Downey Jr as the egotistical genius Iron Man; Evans as the charming and heroic old-fashioned Captain America; Hemsworth as the tough, brave demi-god Thor; Johansson as the smart, feisty Black Widow; Ruffalo as the quiet but unstoppable Hulk; and Renner as the quick, deadly Hawkeye. What really makes this story is how all of these characters learn to use each other's strengths as the plot unfolds, and each is as important to the team as the next when it comes to the crunch. Tom Hiddleston is deviously wicked as Loki, delivering an impressively smooth and convincing performance as the enemy of the story. Samuel L Jackson brings his usual mysterious Nick Fury, providing many unexpected laughs from the delivery of his character's one-liners. Fans of other Marvel work will recognise supporting characters played by the likes of Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgard and Gwyneth Paltrow.Avengers Assemble is yet another example of the great work that Marvel can produce, with a fast paced and exciting story that encompasses their best characters. Definitely one to watch, and if you haven't already seen some of the individual character's films this film will probably make you want more! There's only one question that plagues me when I watch this film: would I want to be saved from near death by Iron Man or Captain America?

2022-07-18,"The first ""Avengers"" became a kind of apogee of acquaintance with the whole worlds that the creators of the studio had previously presented to us with love. And the audience's expectations were very high. However, the superhero action movie did not disappoint anyone, because everything was done with a true desire to show a beautiful and colorful story.Marvel managed to pack in 2.5 hours an excellent plot with a lot of chic twists, reveal the fate of the main characters, show how each of the characters develops and what motivation they have. At the same time, everything is flavored with superbly sustained humor, rich not empty dialogues and good actors, whom it was nice to meet again.It is important to note that in the film the antagonist Loki is several heads taller than himself as a rival. He has gained experience, acts prudently and with lightning speed. He is the true god of deception, whose tricks the heroes will surely fall for.There are a lot of heroes in the film who need to be shown in all their glory on the big screen. And not just to show, but to tell about them: who lived this time and how, what is new for him, what kind of relationships with other members of the educated team. And the creators succeeded. The dialogues are interesting, the actors' performance certainly impressed, every frame is like an ornament. Director Jos Whedan managed to show each character in this film, reveal his personality, point out the strengths and weaknesses of the whole team. I think that other team projects like the Fantastic Four and People X did not succeed equally.The confrontations of the heroes are clearly visible. Cap is a man from the past, mentally stuck there. Iron Man is a kind of innovator and rebel, offering drastic measures to save the situation. The Hulk is afraid of everyone and everything, believing that he will definitely harm people by becoming a green giant. Thor is driven by one goal - to take his brother (the scientist) back to Asgard and put him under lock and key. Hawkeye watches everyone and seems to trust only Natasha, who in turn is cunning and smart, ready for anything. And in all this, Mentor Fury needs to rally a motley team to fight back against the enemy. And the film perfectly shows that it is far from easy when there is still no team spirit, and everyone is essentially a loner. And the viewer is watching the evolution of superheroes right here in the process of battle.The percentage of action and colorful action is off the scale in the film. The operators did a great job, the sound is excellent, everything is well combined. In this regard, the film looks in one breath, you don't get tired of it and you want to continue. And we already know what it will be, because the creators tried to make a seed for future projects.""The Avengers"" is head and shoulders above any other team action movies about superheroes.

2013-07-21,"I'm generally a Joss Whedon fan, but this film is truly awful.Now, before I'm pilloried by the Marvel fanboys, let me explain why:1.) The first hour of the film is spent gradually (very gradually, at points) reintroducing characters from the previous Marvel character films. Which this is to be expected, it happens not in any organic way, but in a very perfunctory, forced manner by introducing the crisis immediately as the film begins.This is disconcerting for a number of reasons, not the least of which is because it leaves you very little room to go ""up"" from there. There's no build up to the introduction of the enemy...it's just there.2.) For all of this often needless exposition, there is little, if any, character development within the first half of the film, which left me feeling cold towards any of the main characters - I just don't care if they die. Kill 'em all. 3.) Because the ""action"" starts at the beginning and doesn't really stop, every moment of exposition feels like it takes a year just to get going. What is often intended to be humorous, springy dialogue is delivered in scenes that are utilitarian, at best, and just leaden mill stones, at worst.The script is well-written, and the actors do very serviceable jobs delivering their well-written lines, but the truth is that, because the movie started with action and kept going, no one really cares what they have to say.Will it entertain some people? Yes.

2014-12-01,"In a late scene Hulk beats the daylight out of the one credible super-villain in the film - Loki - and you realize having a team of superheroes - even one that spends a lot of time bickering - does tend to unbalance the scales of justice to the home team. The superheroes also include an indestructible beast - the aforementioned Hulk - and an immortal god - Thor. Like the old Jerry Seinfeld line about Superman - ""why would he needs the rest of the Superfriends - he's Superman!"" Why do you need, for example, Hawkeye - essentially Katniss Everdeen with piercing blue eyes - or Black Widow whose superpower seems to be looking good in leather? This leaves Robert Downey, Jr.'s Ironman who, by contractual arrangement with the $25M a picture actor gets all the good lines. Two in particular, when he calls out an extra for playing Galaga and refers to Thor as ""Point Break"" are instant film classics. Unfortunately, Whedon, like the rest of us, is slave to RDJ's ego so he's left to give just dull exposition dialog to the boring and largely obsolete Captain America (""there's only one God and I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that"") and one-note Samuel L. Jackson (""hey you guys, we need to fight back!""). Having said all that, although a little talky, the film presents expensive-looking prolonged and noisy CGI action sequences which distract, if not entertain. The movie understands its nerdy male audience by lingering on the backsides of the female characters whenever they exit the shot for a meaningful but not creepy length of time (Gweneth Paltrow runs with this trope by only achieving ambulatory movement by strutting at all times). An excellent cast (actor's fees only must have hit the $100M mark) also contributes to a worthwhile outing.

2019-01-14,"While I rated Ant-Man and its sequel, along with Deadpool, well, this movie was not great. Like most movies of this genre it was just a big fight scene and scenes of people using their powers, interspersed with the glorifying of the U$ military. I would never, in a million years watch this movie again.There is more to say on this film, however. I don't like this film for the same reasons that I don't like the 2009 Star Trek movie: it just ends up being one big battle scene and you don't know what is happening or with whom, becoming extremely hard to follow. I don't mind sci-fi films or those with battles, but it needs to be something organized where you can understand what is happening rather than not, as that lessens the enjoyment of watching movies such as this. Perhaps I am also negative about this film as I generally do not like superhero movies as they seem a bit too elitist for my taste, which is why I like films like Deadpool or Deadpool 2 which lampoon this absurdity directly.I'd like to end by saying that this film will obviously be liked by many and probably did swell in the box office, so in these opinions I am likely in the minority, but that is fine as I am wholly principled about my opinions on this film.",2.0,2019-01,Monday,"about:0.11, again:0.07, along:0.09, also:0.06, am:0.23, and:0.11, as:0.19, battle:0.08, be:0.08, being:0.07, big:0.13, bit:0.08, but:0.07, by:0.10, can:0.05, did:0.06, do:0.06, don:0.23, end:0.07, fight:0.07, film:0.21, films:0.12, for:0.07, genre:0.09, great:0.05, hard:0.08, however:0.08, in:0.12, is:0.14, it:0.09, its:0.06, just:0.09, know:0.07, like:0.31, liked:0.09, man:0.05, many:0.06, mind:0.09, more:0.05, most:0.06, movie:0.09, movies:0.14, my:0.10, never:0.07, not:0.11, of:0.11, on:0.08, one:0.04, or:0.15, people:0.07, powers:0.10, probably:0.08, rather:0.10, same:0.08, say:0.06, scene:0.15, scenes:0.06, seem:0.10, sequel:0.09, so:0.04, something:0.07, star:0.09, such:0.08, superhero:0.05, than:0.05, that:0.13, the:0.18, their:0.05, there:0.05, these:0.06, they:0.04, this:0.29, those:0.07, to:0.11, too:0.06, understand:0.09, up:0.05, was:0.07, watch:0.05, watching:0.07, well:0.05, what:0.10, where:0.07, which:0.11, while:0.08, why:0.07, will:0.05, with:0.14, would:0.05, years:0.07, you:0.08"

2019-07-06,"I've noticed that most of these super-heroes battling super-villain films get very high viewer scores on IMDB--8.0 or above. Clearly, many people love this kind of movie. I don't. My thoughts:
I saw this on a plane several years ago. I've seen several others in the genre. In this film--they all seem to be like this--the heroes are battling to save the world. Sometimes, they battle to save the galaxy, or even the universe. In this film, the plot setup is so ridiculous, I can't take any of it even halfway seriously. But the genre fans are pleased, because it delivers the one supreme thing they care most about: beings with super-powers fighting each other. Much of this very over-long movie consists of characters battling, flying around, running around, more fighting, etc., etc. My reaction: giant yawn! What a bore! See, before these kinds of movies--say, before Star Wars, as a point of reference--most movies were not focused on battle scenes, explosions, fate of worlds, etc. They were about characters and human (not alien, etc.) beings. Action scenes, even in action films, did not take up most of the screen time. Now there have been so many of these films, they all seem alike. It's way beyond saturation.

2019-07-10,"I've been struggling for a while now with superhero movies. I'm really into fantasy and science fiction and most of my friends like superhero movies. This supposedly being the ultimate superhero movie, I gave it a go.There are some good things to be said for The Avengers. The special effects are quite decent, there are some funny moments and actors like Johanson and Hiddleston do an awesome job.However, I simply can't fathom how people can so tremendously and even zealously enjoy a movie without a story.

Thor was definitely best served hung over and gave me exactly what I expected, the Avengers did not. I don't know where to begin with this movie, it's just one of those where you die a little inside every time a punchline is delivered. Alright, Samuel L have earned his right to do just that, but the rest of them have not. It's extremely predictable, you see everything coming from miles away. If you're expecting a great story you would do best to rethink your choice of movie. There is way to many heroes, the story becomes a messy tangle of too many stories and the only one making me laugh is Stark (Iron man). Also they all seem to have the same strength all of a sudden.

2015-02-09,"I'm not exactly sure I get the hype, but this movie felt pretty sub-par. I'm not an extremist who thinks films should have a cult format, I do enjoy big production, though blockbusters have seen better days. They basically put together some comic book heroes of some sort and tried to come up with a reasonable explanation for having them all participate in the newest world/New York saving.Not a good idea, the rushed pace to make every character fit the length is easily noticed. I'm no super-hero expert - quite the opposite - but I'm pretty sure Scarlett Johansson's past doesn't involve two parents made of stone, so I'd argue her acting is not at its finest.Not that the script helps. Hollywood makes amazing stuff, but its stigma of being shallow, focused on silliness can be entirely summarized in this particular movie. The cheesy lines aiming for climatic humor, the grand scale explosions, lots of well-known names in the cast. Nothing really stand out because nothing has sufficient time to shine, everything feels cramped.Destruction on this scale demands a villain with capital V. Loki is never that guy. With the exception of a scene that turned out to be faked, with Johansson's character, he never looks threatening. It's hard to tell where everyone came about, even the main antagonist himself, because every few minutes a new super-hero pops up on screen.The effects are top-notch after all.

2012-07-03,"First off, you have to be naive way beyond Pollyanna to think that the orgasmically, hyperbolically glowing reviews were NOT churned out by a PR machine.It's getting easier to decide what makes a flick great or not. I was just rewatching Nights of Cabiria, and it's a great case for how a rock solid story and labor-of-love direction more than compensates for flaws in other areas.The problem with Avengers is that it's a hollow concept/myth ginned up with some admittedly clever writing and CGI. The difference is that, to me, the writing and production don't compensate for a lousy core plot line.The classic deus ex machina resolves inextricable gotchas in plot development: In Avengers, the deus ex machina is the villain, introduced at the beginning to set the plot in motion and give the writers a reason to get up in the morning. Loki touches people with a weird stick and they magically become his partisans; how lame could a plot point possibly be? I will again mention that, once forces contrive to bring our good guys into some kind of alliance, the writing is remarkably good; even enjoyable.But I have to mention a few more of my personal bugaboos.First off, being a sort of closet Discordian, my ears prick up when a ""troublemaker god"" is maligned. Loki as an evil nemesis strikes me a bit incongruous. I like troublemaker gods! They keep us on our toes, and keep us from devolving into protoplasmic sludge. I don't like seeing the glorious tradition of troublemaker gods as agents of change being blasphemed like this.Next, look at Loki's statement of intent: He wants to take away our freedom, thereby making us free.** Why do I feel like I'm watching Dr. Evil ask for ""ONE MILLION DOLLARS!"" all over again? Don't the writers know that human beings have been giving up their freedom to become free as long as there has been civilization? Are you in a relationship in which you've abdicated your principles for the short term gain of freedom from abject loneliness? Are you locked into an economic system that takes away more and more of your freedom? Haven't you already internalized the view that this kind of enslavement is freedom?

2012-06-17,"I dragged my heels when it came to Avengers Assemble. Did I really want to see yet another comic book adaptation that will be rehashed in ten years for viewers with goldfish memories (The Amazing Spider-man being a case in point)? Apparently I did.I've never been a great reader of graphic novels though I dipped into the odd Batman and Flash Gordon book while still building camps in hedges but in recent years my forays into pictorial literature have been less frequent and more specific; the favoured and most notable examples being Joe Sacco's Palestine and, a particular high point for me, J. M. DeMatteis' The Compleat Moonshadow.But I digress.Avengers Assemble concerned me; with so many disappointing and, occasionally, disastrous adaptations out there (The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, both of the Hulk adaptations to date) what hope was there for a film that threw together a smorgasbord of superheroes all vying for top billing, one of which hasn't been tested on the public with a big screen outing of her own? With so many egos and so little time it would be a task and a half for the scriptwriter, Joss Whedon, to adequately divvy out the lines.I needn't have concerned myself with such trivialities. Whedon, who also directs, does an admirable job of bouncing the dialogue between characters without swaying too heavily in one direction. There isn't a clear star in this grand ensemble piece although that success leads to a new issue in that none are able to engage us with a fully fleshed-out story of their own. It doesn't matter with the likes of Robert Downey Jnr's Iron Man, who has had two hugely successful outings, but is frustrating in the case of Scarlet Johansson's Black Widow.There's no need to go into detail on the plot; it's a superhero flick so naturally something or someone (Loki, Thor's adopted brother in this instance), threatens the existence of mankind and the superheroes fly into action to save the day. It's formulaic but a lot of fun, if not particularly original or inspiring. It's difficult to surprise cinema-goers nowadays and plots are recycled, embellished and reimagined more often than conceived, but that needn't be a major issue in a genre film on this scale when the viewer isn't demanding any more than to be entertained.The cast is superb and, in the case of the principals, either recognizable as stars in their own right or courtesy of the roles they are reprising here. Mostly they do as you'd expect and deserve neither great plaudits nor condemnation; it's not that kind of film. However, beyond the obvious star-billed cast, there are some who delight absolutely. Tom Hiddleston (Wallander, The Deep Blue Sea), as Loki, is effortlessly compelling and avoids melodrama in his wickedness that so many villains lean towards, while Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker, The Town) is an actor who's been around for a few years and co-starred in a number of excellent, if not huge, films. As Clint Barton he again lends solid support and proves to be a most watchable and compelling actor. It's just a pity that he's given little opportunity to develop his alter ego, Hawkeye, and one can only hope the inevitable sequel will rectify that.The unexpected quality comes in the form of the Hulk. With two major Hollywood adaptations to date, the kindest comment one can make is that their stars, Eric Bana and Edward Norton, were both put to shame by the dated Bill Bixby performance. In Avengers Assemble, though, Mark Ruffalo truly shines as the tortured, reluctant recruit, Bruce Banner. The CG big green lump is created more convincingly, though still not flawlessly, here than in previous attempts but it's as Banner that Ruffalo proves himself. For once we have a portrayal of Banner that lays his soul bare for us all to see the demons running around inside it. And, at last, I'm actually looking forward to the solo outing they must surely give Ruffalo's Hulk. Let's just hope it's third time lucky.Another film review from The Squiss.

2012-06-30,"I saw the Avengers with no real knowledge of the comic book series or any of the characters beforehand. However it took me only 10 minutes of reading IMDb reviews to realise that the waters are clearly divided between Avengers fans and Dark Knight fans. For me I was disappointed after seeing The Avengers however I can largely attribute that to my backgrounds in reading, understanding and writing about complex ideas, something Christopher Nolan's films have drawn out of me. With that said though, the Avengers is a different kind of comic book film. If you're looking for a fun, action based movie for kids then the Avengers is for you. However if you have desires for films with grand ideas, deep characters and complex plots as well as the Batman factor, then the Dark Knight Rises is definitely for you. One thing is certain though, you cannot compare both films against each other. Joss Whedon uses the core elements of the comic series that brought out a very Michael Bay representation while Chrisopher Nolan transforms the comic book ideas into grander social commentaries on moral and philosophical issues while still giving the Dark Knight the attention it deserves. I found the Avengers to be a typical clichè heroes win, predictable, static film something which really takes the sting out of a film for me. I sat through the film realising that the Avengers would come through and win by the way the film was constructed. With the Dark Knight, no one could have predicted the Jokers complex schemes involving Harvey Dent and the way that Batman still beat the joker yet lost the most in the end. That is in my opinion where the Avengers falls short. It's use of poorly developed characters such as Loki, predictable story line and plot, overuse of CG and cliché's give it his rating. Sorry Avengers fans it might be hard to understand but trust me, people who write bad reviews for the Avengers criticizing plot and story are well read and any movie needs a good and dynamic plot regardless of the genre.",4.0,2012-06,Saturday,"10:0.04, about:0.03, action:0.03, after:0.04, against:0.06, and:0.19, any:0.08, are:0.05, as:0.07, avengers:0.24, bad:0.05, batman:0.12, be:0.05, between:0.05, book:0.13, both:0.05, brought:0.06, but:0.02, by:0.03, can:0.03, characters:0.09, come:0.04, comic:0.15, could:0.04, dark:0.20, definitely:0.05, different:0.05, disappointed:0.06, each:0.04, end:0.04, fans:0.15, film:0.14, films:0.12, for:0.17, found:0.06, fun:0.04, genre:0.06, give:0.05, giving:0.06, good:0.03, hard:0.05, have:0.07, heroes:0.04, his:0.03, however:0.15, if:0.06, imdb:0.07, in:0.06, into:0.04, is:0.09, it:0.09, joss:0.04, kind:0.06, knight:0.22, line:0.06, loki:0.03, looking:0.06, me:0.17, might:0.06, minutes:0.06, most:0.04, movie:0.04, my:0.06, no:0.07, of:0.17, on:0.03, one:0.05, only:0.04, opinion:0.06, or:0.03, other:0.03, out:0.09, people:0.04, plot:0.12, rating:0.06, re:0.05, read:0.06, real:0.05, really:0.03, reviews:0.12, said:0.06, saw:0.05, seeing:0.05, series:0.12, short:0.06, something:0.09, still:0.09, story:0.07, such:0.05, takes:0.06, that:0.14, the:0.47, then:0.08, thing:0.05, though:0.10, through:0.10, to:0.07, understand:0.06, very:0.03, was:0.04, way:0.08, well:0.06, whedon:0.04, where:0.04, which:0.04, while:0.10, who:0.03, with:0.09, would:0.03, writing:0.06, yet:0.05, you:0.13"

2014-11-15,"This movie was very triggering. It made me recall the times in my life where I saw movies that were not good. The reason this was brought to mind was because this movie was not good, other than as a sort of cultural abyss into which to stare and wonder how things were before the kind of debased species that would make this sort of movie slithered into existence.Despite the fact that this movie isn't very good, it has a lot of accomplished stars in its cast. Each of these unique stars brings to the film their own interpretation of a muted, listless performance. I felt Samuel Jackson's performance was especially so: his listlessness seemed mixed with deep despair, an existential disdain so consuming that even feeling disgust would be a comparative relief for him.In the movie a lot of things flew around.

2016-08-28,"Disclaimer: I am a comic book collector so my review is slightly biased by proxy. But bear with me for a moment.The Avengers comics are some of my favorite Marvel comics (besides the ""New Avengers"" and the ""House of M"" comics) but the movie didn't live up to the legacy of the comics. The jokes in the movie were really good I gotta give them that. But humor alone isn't a good foundation for a movie (unless we're talking about movies which pertain to the Comedy genre, which is clearly not the case here)The biggest problem that I personally had with the movie was the fact that 50% of the action in the movie happens on what appears to be a spaceship, that is reminiscent to those of the Start Trek franchise (I mean, an invisibility cloak? Come on now. Is this a joke? Because I'm pretty certain that the Avengers Quinjet didn't have this feature in the comics, /last time I checked, anyway)In my opinion they should have simply titled the movie ""Attack of the spaceships"". Because that's the only consistent theme in the movie: spaceships.Also, all of the main protagonists acted like little children throughout the majority of the movie. And then at the end they miraculously got a hold of themselves... *movie logic* Furthermore the HULK's development was completely unrealistic. At first he is this uncontrollable mess that can't be reasoned with. But then at the end he has absolute control over his alter ego ... *movie logic* (such a learning curve is unrealistic to say the least)On a side note: the new Captain America suit looks goofy. What were the costume designers thinking? A helmet? ... Remove the helmet and give him his protruding wings on his headpiece back. For the love of God.Instead of aimlessly pumping out movie adaptations Marvel should take it slowly and try to focus more on the quality of their movies (Quality > Quantity)p.s. I'm not even going to rant about the fact that Marvel had to introduce yet another Universe just to make the movies work (because they are a-canon by nature ergo non-compliant with the original Marvel canon and the respective origin stories of the Avengers). p.s.s. the reason why I'm so passionate about these types of movies (comic book adaptations) is because most people don't really care about the franchise.

2012-05-13,"I must confess that I'm not really a massive fan of the comic book movies. I don't normally go and see them at the cinema, but someone dragged me along to watch Avengers Assemble.The plot is predictably simple with an alien enemy threatening security on earth. This means that a team of superheroes are required to defeat the enemy. The superheroes that are recruited include Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and the Black Widow. The thing that I disliked about the film is the fact that I didn't really care whether any of the characters survived or perished. There are plenty of funny one-liners in the style of the Bond one-liners. It also appears that the actors had a good time making the film. Scarlett Johansson looks particularly good in a cat-suit throughout the movie.

2014-04-19,"The Avengers might be a good follow up to five essentially unrelated movies that ties all the characters together, and it might have great action but it suffers at the hands of Joss Whedon, who should never be allowed near movies again.The writing is corny and melodramatic. The villain has a cookie-cutter motivation (I want to get the MacGuffin so I can take over the world because I'm better) which seems to be the case in these films. Loki was entirely forgettable as a villain. The scenes between Black Widow and Hawkeye, and Phil Coulson and Nick Fury had cringeworthy dialog and delivery. One thing I noticed which I've never noticed before in a movie was that the lighting in all the indoor sections was really bad. It made everything look like it was from 2004.Nobody acted well in this movie, but the three worst offenders were Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L Jackson, and Mark Ruffalo. All three are good actors/actresses, but Scarlett was completely wooden as Black Widow, Jackson was corny as hell as Fury, and Ruffalo reeked of a high schooler trying to remember his lines for the school play. All three of them have put in excellent performances before, especially Ruffalo in Zodiac, but here they all **** the bed. Robert Downey Jr. also put in his most obnoxious Tony Stark performance yet, mostly due to the horrible, unfunny one-liners he was given. That kind of sums up The Avengers: one-liners. Everyone, even the God of Thunder himself, mostly just spews one-liners at each other. Every character is Tony Stark. Even Captain America.There were good things though: The fact that most of the conflict involved the Avengers and their in-fighting was a great idea. The action was really well done, especially the helicarrier scene in which everything that could possibly go wrong went wrong.The Avengers had some good action and isn't that enough? Well, not it's not. Not when your movie is two and a half hours, an hour and a half of which being dialog. There are better movies in this series, like both Captain America Movies, the first Iron Man, and The Incredible Hulk. If people like this movie, that's fine.

When I woke up, it was the last fighting scene. The same thing seemed to keep happening over and over again, so it wasn't really that exciting. The only thing I got out of that movie was some of Hulk's jokes, which were pretty funny, and Iron Man makes you laugh too sometimes. Other than that, it was only OK.

2012-07-09,"It's not really clear to me why this film is so highly rated here. There are only two things to recommend it: spectacular special effects and the acting of Robert Downey Jr and most of the rest of the ensemble, who make the absolute maximum out of the material. All kudos to them for their fine performances.The main problem for me is with the story, which is absolute dross. What the hell is going on with the flying aircraft carrier, for example? Yeah, it looks great on screen, but in terms of logic there is none. Why are the giant bugs so intent on destroying or dominating Earth? Why are there these Scandinavian demigods running about when everybody knows these belong only to Norse mythology and not to the real world? I could go on but I won't bore all of you who are no doubt going to retort with lengthy explanations of all the ins and outs of the history of the fantasy universe this all arises from. However, viewing this as a stand-alone film, without knowing the extended comic-book background, the events in the film, however exciting, don't make much sense.I'm sorry, I'm not a superhero buff (I admit it, I hate superhero comic books), but seriously none of this guff makes any sense.

I think marvel should expand more with putting the characters from the TV series as well in the movies like for example daredevil and others as well and marvel should get the rights for Spiderman to be in the cinematic universe.,5.0,2016-03,Wednesday,"actors:0.09, america:0.18, and:0.10, as:0.23, back:0.09, bad:0.09, be:0.05, because:0.07, better:0.08, brought:0.12, but:0.04, captain:0.19, characters:0.11, chris:0.09, cinematic:0.23, else:0.11, especially:0.09, everything:0.09, fight:0.09, for:0.08, from:0.11, get:0.07, good:0.17, great:0.06, he:0.12, hulk:0.10, idea:0.12, in:0.22, is:0.04, it:0.07, like:0.16, made:0.07, making:0.10, marvel:0.23, more:0.12, movie:0.08, movies:0.06, my:0.12, of:0.07, on:0.05, only:0.07, opinion:0.12, others:0.11, scenes:0.07, series:0.11, should:0.26, than:0.07, that:0.04, the:0.37, they:0.05, thing:0.09, think:0.15, to:0.07, universe:0.21, used:0.12, was:0.13, well:0.18, with:0.08, world:0.08"
